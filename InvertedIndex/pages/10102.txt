I was very fresh," said Evenepoel. "I'm especially satisfied with my sprint. Lately, I've been working a lot on my explosiveness, and it paid off."It is Evenepoel's first win since securing the second of his world time trial titles at the World Championships in Zurich in September 2024.The Belgian hopes to compete in the three Ardennes classics and the Tour de Romandie in preparation for this year's Tour de France.Evenepoel won gold in the Olympic time trail and the road race at the Paris Games last summer.He also finished third overall in the Tour de France, winning the stage-seven individual time trial.Related topicsCyclingComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 110Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8831 viewing8.8k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
