It is just brilliant to see the growth."African riders on the riseImage source, Ozan YavuzImage caption, Kiya Rogora (centre) has set himself the goal of starting a Grand TourWhen the first African riders started competing in Europe a decade ago, in many cases they were forced to fight it out in races as individuals.Now that they are getting significant real estate as part of teams in the peloton, it makes them feel less like outsiders."When you are in cycling and doing such difficult races, only you and the riders around you know how hard it is," explained Coats."When you are surrounded by Europeans, it is hard to relate and communicate."When you have riders around you to whom you can relate better, it helps the mental processing in a race."Ethiopia's Kiya Rogora, who rides for continental tour team X-Speed United, is another good example of the young talent beginning to make a mark."I am still learning my craft and being at these big European races is the best way to do this," the 21-year-old told the BBC."They are much more intense and competitive."Seeing my fellow East African riders at these races really inspires me. It can be lonely sometimes, and seeing so many guys I know in one place is just wonderful."Inspiring the next generationImage source, Ozan YavuzImage caption, Seven African riders finished in the top 25 at the Tour of MersinAt the other end of the age spectrum is Madar Pro Cycling Team's Azzedine Lagab, an Algerian who is regarded as one of the most efficient and intelligent African riders.The 38-year-old, in his 14th season as a professional, provides an example to follow for the South Africans and fellow Algerians on what is the continent's top-ranked team."I do not feel like a guide myself but just feel proud when some of the younger guys are showing respect to me," he said."I was so happy when some of them in Turkey told me I was their inspiration."South Africa's Stefan de Bod took the overall race win at the Tour of Mersin, while seven Africans finished in the top 25 in the general classification.More riders from across the continent are expected to take part in key races across Europe in the coming months in preparation for their 'home' event in Rwanda in September.Whether or not calls to declare cycling the 'second sport of Africa' are eventually successful, the continent is certainly rising on two wheels.Related topicsAfrica SportCyclingMore on this storyCycling heaven: The African capital with 'no traffic'Published27 March 2019Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8831 viewing8.8k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
