A 28-year-old Belgian man, who handed himself into police on Monday, apologised on Wednesday for hurling the bottle at Van der Poel.The man, from Waregem in west Belgium, said his actions were "stupid and dangerous" and that he had "drunk a lot". "I am so happy that he crossed the finish line first on Sunday, despite my stupid action," he wrote in an email released by Flemish newspaper Het Nieuwsblad."A water bottle was in the grass. I picked it up and threw it when he passed. Without thinking. Half a second later, I realised how stupid and dangerous it was."The man handed himself into a West Flanders police station on Monday.The public prosecutor is deciding what action - if any - to take. Van der Poel, 30, has been involved in several incidents involving spectators in recent years.In December 2023, he spat at some spectators during a cyclocross race in the Netherlands, saying he had had enough of being booed and having liquid thrown at him.The following April, he had beer thrown at him during the Tour of Flanders.Related topicsCyclingTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8831 viewing8.8k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
