You've just got to [think] on your feet and depending on how the race goes, you can't really have a plan."American Christopher Blevins took the men's elite race, having also won the first round a week ago.Nove Mesto na Morave in the Czech Republic will host the next round from 23-25 May.Related topicsCyclingTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8793 viewing8.8k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
