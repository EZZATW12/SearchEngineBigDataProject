I thought I was riding for second place. I just can't believe it, I'm so happy."It's been a rough spring for me so far, but today I'm so happy to be back where I know I can be."It is Powless' first win since claiming the Japan Cup Road Race in October.Van Aert, who has picked up nine Tour de France stage victories, remains without a win since taking the 10th stage in the Vuelta a Espana last August."It was me who made the call for the sprint. I was confident I could win, but in the sprint I cramped completely," Van Aert said."I wanted the victory so bad, especially after all the criticism I've been through and all the bad luck I've been through."In the women's race Elisa Longo Borghini recorded her 50th career victory with a fine solo effort after breaking away from the peloton with 30km left."I was very hungry for the victory here," Longo Borghini said. "I really wanted to prove that I was strong. There was some frustration in the last weeks, and I need to thank my trainer who is always keeping me calm."Related topicsCyclingTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8793 viewing8.8k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
