at cornerback and wide receiver.He has been described as a 'unicorn' and the Jags' decision to trade up from the fifth pick suggests they are willing to grant Hunter's wish of being given the chance to be a two-way player in the NFL too.The last time there was a genuine two-way player in the NFL was in the 1990s with Hall of Famer Deion Sanders - Shedeur's father and their head coach at both Colorado and Jackson State.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Travis Hunter could not contain his excitement as he skipped onto the stage next to Green Bay's iconic Lambeau FieldWhat happened with Sanders?After last year's draft, Sanders was installed as the initial favourite to be this year's first pick.Ward was expected to be a late-round pick but a fine season with Miami saw him usurp Sanders in January, while uncertainty grew surrounding Sanders.The New York Giants took pass rusher Abdul Carter with the third pick, before the New England Patriots chose offensive tackle Will Campbell and Cleveland claimed defensive tackle Mason Graham.In scenes reminiscent of the humbling wait Aaron Rodgers endured during the 2005 Draft, Sanders continued to slide.And although the 23-year-old had a pre-draft meeting with the Pittsburgh Steelers, who need a quarterback, they also snubbed him with the 21st pick.Sanders and his family were spared the ignominy of waiting in the green room in Green Bay as he was not invited to the draft.But Shedeur and his father Deion looked dismayed at a private party in their native Texas, as the Giants traded back into the first round for the 25th pick, only to take another quarterback - Jaxson Dart out of Mississippi.Sanders didn't just fall past the 24th pick - where the Packers put Rodgers out of his misery - he fell into the second round, with Ward and Dart being the only QBs drafted on day one.Sanders will hope to finally get a call early on Friday, when the draft continues with rounds two and three.Why 'nepo baby' and 'unicorn' have made NFL Draft so intriguingPublished4 days agoWho were the top 10 picks in the draft?Cam Ward, QB, Tennessee TitansTravis Hunter, CB/WR, Jacksonville Jaguars (trade with Cleveland)Abdul Carter, DE, New York GiantsWill Campbell, OL, New England PatriotsMason Graham, DL, Cleveland Browns (trade with Jacksonville)Ashton Jeanty, RB, Las Vegas RaidersArmand Membou, OL, New York JetsTetairoa McMillan, WR, Carolina PanthersKelvin Banks Jr, OL, New Orleans SaintsColston Loveland, TE, Chicago BearsRelated topicsAmerican FootballMore on this storyHow does the NFL draft work?Published4 days agoGet American Football news sent straight to your phonePublished31 JanuaryComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 163Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8815 viewing8.8k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' -
