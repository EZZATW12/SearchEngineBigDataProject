Now he is its most polarising prospect.The 23-year-old helped Colorado turn around their record last season, posting the best pass completion rate in college football (74%).He also won one of the annual quarterback awards, but some feel he holds on to the ball too long and have questioned his arm strength and athleticism.Shedeur, who has been branded a 'nepo baby', says having Deion as his dad has been advantageous to his football career as he has learned to deal with expectation and pressure from a young age.But in March, some NFL staff said Shedeur came across as "brash and arrogant" as well as "unprofessional and disinterested" during his interviews at the Scouting Combine - a week-long event where college players are evaluated by NFL teams before the draft.He is already wealthy and has a bigger profile than any previous draft prospect. Some teams have been put off by the 'circus' - including his outspoken father - that surrounds Sanders, so some analysts fear he could slide out of the top-five picks, perhaps into the second round.Why has Hunter threatened to quit?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Colorado have already retired the jersey numbers worn by Travis Hunter and Shedeur Sanders The NFL has not had a genuine two-way player since Deion Sanders in the 1990s.In 1997, Charles Woodson won the Heisman Trophy for best college player after playing significant time as both a cornerback and wide receiver but he went on to play solely on defence in the NFL.Hunter has also been playing as a cornerback and wide receiver, and won not just last year's awards for best defensive player and best receiver - he clinched the Heisman too.Speaking at the Combine in February, the 21-year-old said his role in the NFL was "up to the organisation" that drafts him, with teams having different ideas on what his best position is.However, last week Hunter said he would "never play again" if he is not given the chance to continue being a two-way player in the NFL.The Cleveland Browns have the second pick and their general manager Andrew Berry has compared Hunter to baseball's two-way star Shohei Ohtani, adding that "you get a unicorn if you use him both ways".Hunter's father is currently on probation but has been granted permission to attend the draft, external with his son.The Draft 'unicorn' that NFL teams just can't figure outPublished3 MarchWhat's it like to go through the NFL draft?Published23 April 2020Where will Hunter & Sanders be drafted?Hunter has said it is "super important" for him to be the first overall pick but Ward is now the clear favourite to be selected by the Tennessee Titans.The ex-Miami quarterback has not been described as a generational talent like previous first picks Joe Burrow, Trevor Lawrence and Caleb Williams were in recent years.However, he has been compared to Patrick Mahomes for his play-making ability – he can throw from different arm angles and make off-platform plays.Much will then hinge on what Cleveland and the New York Giants do with the second and third picks, respectively.They both need a young franchise quarterback but this year's draft class is perceived to be weak for quarterbacks and both teams signed veterans in free agency, potentially to bridge them over to next year.Now the Browns and Giants are reportedly open to trading those early picks, external, or they could go for Hunter and pass rusher Abdul Carter before taking a quarterback with a less valuable pick.Prospects projected to be early picks tend to be invited to the draft and Sanders is not among the 15 who will be attending.The New Orleans Saints (ninth pick) and the Pittsburgh Steelers (21st) could also be in the market for a starting quarterback.If Sanders is still on the board after that then fellow quarterbacks Jaxson Dart, Jalen Milroe and Tyler Shough could all be drafted before him, something no-one thought possible a few months ago.Related topicsAmerican FootballMore on this storyBrady & Purdy - inside two of the NFL's biggest draft stealsPublished24 April 2024Get American Football news sent straight to your phonePublished31 JanuaryComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 120Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8815 viewing8.8k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
