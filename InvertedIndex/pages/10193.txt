That changed in 2024 when Newry's Charlie Smyth signed to the practice squad of the New Orleans Saints and Jude McAtamney was picked up by the New Giants.McAtamney, who hails from Swatragh, was elevated to the Giants' gameday squad and successfully kicked a field goal and extra points against the Washington Commanders in November.Both had their roots in gaelic football and the 'second wave' of kicking talent in this year's class of 2025 consists of two more from that background.Wicklow man Mark McNamee, who played goalkeeper for the Ballyboden St Enda's club in Dublin, and Laois native Ross Bolger who arrives via a two-year College career at Idaho State. They are part of a six-strong group of specialist position players in the NFL's latest International Player Pathway programme with their big audition coming on 26 March when they will be put through their paces before NFL scouts at Pro Day.'You're definitely an underdog'The two Irishmen have already impressed at the recent NFL Combine held in Indianapolis, where McNamee was good for all but one of his kicks - and Bolger was successful in 12 of his allotted 14."It went very well. As a kicking unit we wanted to go there and flash our talent, let the scouts know that we are there for a reason and on merit," said McNamee.  "I wasn't overly focused on the numbers but more the process of kicking and making sure we came across well."The pair know that being in the international class, they have to work just that little bit harder than their American peers to catch the scouts' eyes."You're definitely an underdog," said Bolger. "There's a low expectation but then there is a really high ceiling.  When you're going kick-for-kick alongside Americans and then are doing better than them, that's when the scouts here are impressed."Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Jude McAtamney (right) last November featured in a regular season NFL game while Charlie Smyth (left) remains part of the New Orleans practice squad as he also attempts to forge an NFL careerUnlike McNamee, who went straight from gaelic football into the IPP programme, Bolger has just completed two years' college experience as a kicker and punter with the Idaho State Bengals after his talent was discovered and honed by the Irish kicking coach and mentor Tadhg Leader."Once I got a full scholarship, that was the time when I really believed I could do it.  I gauged myself against American lads and that gave me the confidence that what Tadhg was saying was right," added the Laois man."And I have great memories – two years playing college football in the States was a class experience. I played in front of 35,000 against Oregon State in the opening game of last season in a great atmosphere."As Pro Day approaches, McNamee says they have taken much inspiration from Smyth and McAtamney's path to the big time this time last year."It was amazing to see someone could go from playing gaelic football to competing at the NFL Combine. Once I saw that I knew I had a skill that would transfer well if I was given time to prepare," the Ballyboden GAA goalkeeper added."Charlie was the trailblazer for me. He's incredible and confidence just radiates from him. "He was the youngest in the group last year and to be able to come in and compete as well as he did at the Combine and Pro Day and then get signed... it's unbelievable he was able to do it."'Unbelievable opportunity'As for making that same transformation from Gaelic to American football, both McNamee and Bolger have worked hard on mastering a different kicking technique, with both likening it to perfecting a golf swing."The sweet spot in the ball in Gaelic is lower than on a ball in American football," McNamee explained.  "Initially, I started kicking the ball too low which meant it was over-rotating and getting no distance.  So it was adjusting my angle and swing and once I'd found where the sweet spot was I was able to introduce power into it and dive a bit deeper into the foot angle, follow through, aim and finish.  "I don't really think about it now – it's more natural and I kick that ball like I've been doing it for years.  As my technique's improved, I've added distance and there's more to come."For Bolger, it's about doing the hard work in the gym away from the field. "Once I was at college I realised there was more to it than biceps curls and looking in the mirror. At Idaho State, I was in the gym with the heavy weights on my back every day. That has helped with my kicking distance.  "A lot of it is mastering technique too, of course. You have to learn to keep swinging your leg the same and keep your technique. You can overthink it sometimes, definitely."Related topicsNorthern Ireland SportAmerican FootballMore on this storyNFL fixtures and resultsGet American Football news sent straight to your phonePublished31 JanuaryTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8865 viewing8.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Northern Ireland sportThe 'rugby student' stepping up to lead IrelandPre-contract agreements - why are they different in NI?Record-breaker Dunlop 'breaks mould' of modern sporting heroesMeet Jude McAtamney - the New York Giants kicker from Derry Elsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
