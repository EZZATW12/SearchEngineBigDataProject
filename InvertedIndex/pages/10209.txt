She got booed out of the stadium. MAGA is very unforgiving," Trump posted on his Truth platform.Swift had endorsed Trump's presidential rival Kamala Harris during the 2024 election.Tennis legend Serena Williams, who appeared in the half-time show, wrote on X: "I love you Taylor Swift, don't listen to those booos!!"Lamar brings bristling rap to music capitalImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Kendrick Lamar's red, white and blue-themed half-time showResplendent in star-spangled hat and jacket, Hollywood legend Samuel L Jackson played host as Uncle Sam to announce multiple award-winning rapper Kendrick Lamar for the half-time show.After scooping five Grammys last week in Los Angeles, the US rapper was on top form in the Superdome, bristling through a 13-minute set.Frequent collaborator SZA joined him on stage for their hits 'All the Stars' and 'Luther' while 23-time grand slam winner Williams also made a surprise cameo as a dancer.The title song on his Grammy-winning Record of the Year 'Not Like Us' was the culmination (and the fatal blow) in an escalating rap beef with Drake - in which he accused his nemesis of cultural appropriation and paedophilia.With the song the subject of an active defamation lawsuit, it was unclear whether Lamar would be permitted to perform it.In the end, he did, self-censoring the word "paedophile" but leaving other lyrics intact, including the one that went viral.That was the only moment in Lamar's 13-minute set where the crowd audibly joined in with the words.Kendrick Lamar's Super Bowl show was one big teasePublished10 FebruaryEagles outclass Chiefs to win Super Bowl - in picturesPublished10 FebruaryBig Easy bounces back in styleImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Louisiana native Trombone Shorty performed before the gameJust five weeks ago, the city of New Orleans was struck by terrible tragedy.Early on 1 January, a US Army veteran drove a high-speed truck into a crowd of people, killing 14 and wounding dozens before being apprehended and killed by police fire.For Super Bowl 59, with 65,719 fans in attendance, thousands more in the city and the US president in town, security was heavy throughout the build-up.Police lined the streets and, in the balmy 25C weather, their reassuring presence brought a lively and convivial atmosphere, far removed from the terror of last month.It was classic New Orleans for the pre-match anthems, jazz musicians and Louisiana natives Trombone Shorty and Jon Batiste bringing local heritage and elegance to the regalia.There was a poignant moment too immediately before kick-off as members of the New Orleans emergency services held up framed photos of the victims of the January attack and family members participated in the honorary coin toss.Done with class and dignity, the Big Easy's 11th time of hosting the Super Bowl - a record with Miami - once again made putting on America's biggest game look simple.Related topicsSuper BowlAmerican FootballMore on this storyGet American Football news sent straight to your phonePublished31 JanuaryComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 2021Top storiesLive.Â Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8865 viewing8.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
