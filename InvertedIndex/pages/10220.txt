It alleges they are members of a South American theft group that targeted high-profile athletes.The complaint names the men as Pablo Zuniga Cartes, Ignacio Zuniga Cartes, Bastian Jimenez Freraut, Jordan Quiroga Sanchez, Bastian Orellano Morales, Alexander Huiaguil Chavez, and Sergio Ortega Cabello.The group, who are aged between 23 and 38, all face a maximum of 10 years in jail if convicted over the burglaries.It is not yet clear if they have legal representation. Four of the defendants - Mr Cabello, Mr Chavez, Mr Morales, and Mr Sanchez - pleaded not guilty to initial charges in Ohio last month.While the federal complaint does not name the victims, it said the Kansas City homes of two Chiefs players were burgled in October.Kelce's home was robbed on 7 October as he was starting a game against the New Orleans Saints. Officials said $20,000 (£15,900) in cash was stolen from his $6m home.And Mahomes's residence was burgled on 5 October, police said at the time.The complaint also alleges the seven men were involved in the November burglary of a home belonging to a Milwaukee Bucks basketball player. The date of this incident is when forward Bobby Portis reported a burglary.A safe containing watches, chains, jewellery, and cash was stolen along with a designer suitcase and designer bags. In total, the items stolen were worth more than $1.5m.The athletes make for easy targets in part because they have valuable belongings and public schedules, security experts told the BBC last year."In any professional football event, for instance, there's 106 players, 53 on each team, that are not going to be home, not including coaches. And some of those players may have very lucrative contracts and live in nice places," said former FBI agent Jeff Lanza.The NFL has been warning players about the crimes, sending a memo last year which said "organised and skilled groups" appeared to be targeting them. The memo said the groups were tracking the players' whereabouts on social media and through public records.The issue is an international one. In the UK, a number of top Premier League footballers have also been targeted with burglaries in recent years.ChileUnited StatesRelatedChile power cut: 'We were trapped like sardines in the dark'26 Feb 2025Latin AmericaChile power cut leaves millions without electricity25 Feb 2025Latin AmericaFog harvesting could provide water for arid cities20 Feb 2025Latin AmericaMore51 mins agoWhat the world is looking for in Canada's electionAssassinations, spies and taxes... as Canadians head to the polls, several other countries are closely watching.51 mins agoWorld2 hrs agoOne dead and multiple injured after hit-and-run boat crash in Florida The Clearwater Ferry, which had 45 people on board, was struck by a boat which then fled the scene.2 hrs agoUS & Canada2 hrs agoCritical week for US's future in Ukraine-Russia talks, Rubio saysIt is a "very critical" week for the White House and its involvement, Secretary of State Marco Rubio tells US media.2 hrs agoWorld3 hrs agoDozens of African migrants killed in US strike on Yemen, Houthis sayHouthi-run media report 68 bodies have been recovered from a detention centre in Saada that was holding African migrants.3 hrs agoWorld7 hrs agoCanada votes in pivotal election transformed by TrumpThe US president came to dominate on the campaign trail, with the contest being viewed as a referendum on how Canada should engage with him.7 hrs agoUS & CanadaBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.
