I've always wanted this."The second it [returning to rugby] creeps into your head you start doubting yourself and that's not going to happen with me."Rees-Zammit re-signs as wide receiver for JaguarsPublished17 FebruaryEagles demolish Chiefs to deny them Super Bowl three-peatPublished10 FebruaryGet American Football news sent straight to your phonePublished31 JanuaryRees-Zammit re-signed for the Jaguars on Monday, after Jacksonville initially opted not to sign him on a reserve/future contract in January.The new deal means Rees-Zammit will form part of the Jaguars' off-season roster, which can include as many as 90 players.The next goal for the former Gloucester and 2021 British and Irish Lions wing is to be selected on an active regular-season roster.This means Rees-Zammit would have to survive the cut from 90 players down to 53, something he was unable to achieve with Kansas City Chiefs in 2024."The first step of the dream is to make an active roster, I'm doing everything I can to make that happen," said Rees-Zammit."This is my dream, and the way I make it come true is by working as hard as I can to make the roster."Every day is a challenge, every day is hard hard work, but it is one that for this dream to come true is worth doing."I'm doing everything I can to become a better player on the field and a better person off the field, so I'm really looking forward to this season."Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Louis Rees-Zammit attended the Super Bowl in New OrleansWhile Rees-Zammit returns to the franchise, the same cannot be said for a significant portion of the coaching staff.This off-season the Jaguars have parted ways with their head coach, Doug Pederson, their offensive and defensive co-ordinators, as well as general manager Trent Baalke.Jacksonville have since named Liam Coen as their new head coach, after his impressive season as the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' offensive co-ordinator.Coen and his coaches have brought renewed hope to a franchise that won just four games last season."They are another reason I wanted to sign for the Jaguars. It's so exciting this project," added Rees-Zammit."It's something I want to be a part of, I want to learn as much as I can."The Buccaneers offence was so good last year, and we have some serious weapons in our squad."There's so much potential, and these coaches will help unleash everyone."Related topicsAmerican FootballGloucesterRugby UnionNFL news on the BBC'A lot of wear and tear' - Kelce considers retirementPublished14 FebruaryMoore named Saints coach after leaving Super Bowl winners EaglesPublished11 FebruaryTaylor Swift, Lionel Messi, Jay-Z and Trump among big names at Super BowlPublished10 FebruaryComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 257Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8865 viewing8.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
