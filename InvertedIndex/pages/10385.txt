The Londoner has risen from defeats to mould himself into a world champion with a seemingly unshakeable confidence.Usyk, on the other hand, has made a career of breaking British hearts and will aim to do it again when he meets Dubois.Having swept two-time heavyweight world champion Joshua aside, Dubois now has his sights on felling another of the old guard in the Ukrainian. But were it any other fighter, an 11-year age gap would prompt discussions about a passing-of-the-torch moment, but such is Usyk's pedigree he will be clear favourite.The fight will represent a full-circle moment for Dubois, whose mental fortitude was called into question after his loss to Usyk almost three years ago in Poland.There was also the small matter of the controversy of the low blow as Dubois was mere centimetres away from knocking down Usyk and perhaps finishing the fight. There are not many who would have predicted Dubois would be the one to knock Usyk off his perch - that was supposed to be Fury - but in July, on home turf, Dubois will have the chance to banish demons and claim his spot at the top of the heavyweight mountain.Related topicsBoxingBoxing schedule and results 2025Published1 day agoWatch every Born to Brawl episodePublished28 April 2024More boxing from the BBCNotifications, social media and more with BBC SportPublished31 JanuaryComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 258Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8851 viewing8.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
