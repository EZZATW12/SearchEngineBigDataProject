I get it because it's completely out of their comfort zone."But I'm used to having that spotlight on me so it's nothing out of the ordinary."'Civil war was awful - I was a kid but it became normal'Published23 March'If Big George hit you, you stayed hit'Published22 MarchFrom Manchester, Middlemiss appeared destined to establish himself as a major face on UK television before suddenly deciding to follow a totally different path.With a showreel including credits on Emmerdale and Waterloo Road, his decision shocked many within drama circles. But not, it transpires, those closest to him given his competitive streak."Acting can be tough but it's a damn sight easier than boxing," Middlemiss laughs."My family and friends know how competitive I am and my dad has always loved boxing so I don't think they fell off their chairs when they found out what I wanted to do."OK, they were probably a bit surprised. But not stunned or speechless, I don't think, because of how I am."There are more relaxing ways to make a living but there's something about boxing which immediately grabbed me. I think it's the pressure you have to put yourself under because, in the ring, it's just you and the other guy so you can't rely on anyone else."You have to show focus and have a drive to keep improving. You can never let up."From the first moment I walked into a gym it just appealed to me. Maybe because, in my eyes, it's the ultimate and purest test you can ever experience."Middlesmiss, who starred alongside Sally Lindsay and Robin Asquith in the Madame Blanc Mysteries, was actually a promising cricketer before deciding to don the gloves.But long fielding days put Middlesmiss off the sport, breaking his dad's heart who loved attending the lengthy matches."It's the polar opposite to boxing," Middlesmiss says. "I just fell out of love with it in the end. It was a gradual decline."Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Alfie's father Phil played Des Barnes on Coronation Street in the 90sMiddlesmiss' parents were among a vociferous following which cheered him on during last month's points victory over Caine Singh of Middlesbrough at the Co-op Live arena.The featherweight contest, which took place on the undercard of Jack Catterall's ill-fated world title eliminator against Arnold Barboza Jr, preserved the young featherweight's unblemished professional record having beaten Jesus Gonzalez in Liverpool two months earlier.Trained by Catterall's mentors Jamie Moore and Nigel Travis at Walkden ABC, Middlemiss proved his pedigree as an amateur by winning both the English and North West championships.He is next scheduled to be in action on the undercard of Joe Joyce's heavyweight fight with Filip Hrgovic on Saturday at the same arena as his last outing."Boxing can be a lonely sport as everything is on you," Middlemiss says."As an amateur, it can be a bit overwhelming when you get a loss or a setback."There are injuries too. I've had a few minor niggles along the way but, fortunately, nothing serious. "It's how you respond to all of that which defines you. The same as disappointments in acting or any other walk of life."Related topicsBoxingBoxing schedule and results 2025Published1 day agoWatch every Born to Brawl episodePublished28 April 2024More boxing from the BBCNotifications, social media and more with BBC SportPublished31 JanuaryTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8908 viewing8.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
