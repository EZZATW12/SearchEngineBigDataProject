About 4,000 fans witnessed Lauren Price dominate trailblazer Natasha Jonas in the main event of an all-female card.In the chief support, Caroline Dubois outpointed Bo Mi Re Shin in an entertaining battle. The self-assured world champion has the potential to make waves – in the ring and commercially - for years to come.Karriss Artingstall became British champion by beating Raven Chapman in a featherweight contest that shows a gradual deepening of the depth of women's boxing, which has historically been lacking.On the surface, the event - a day before International Women's Day - was a success and provides a launchpad for women's boxing in Britain to progress.But we have been here before.Former world champion Hannah Rankin feels women's boxing failed to capitalise on the momentum created by Savannah Marshall v Claressa Shields in October 2022, when an all-women card packed out the O2 Arena."There was a real opportunity there but when big-time boxing moved to Saudi Arabia, it slowed down the progression and whole trajectory of women's boxing," she says.Saudi Arabia continues to host high-profile men's bouts as women's boxing has generally been overlooked.The trilogy between Irishwoman Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano in New York, which will be broadcast on Netflix in June, will help grow the sport globally, but what can be done to make the female sphere take centre stage in the United Kingdom?This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, 'I'll remember win at Albert Hall for the rest of my life'I'm not a fan of all-female cards - RankinPioneer of women's boxing Jane Couch, TV presenter Stacey Dooley and several female athletes packed out the majestic Kensington venue.The Shields-Marshall card, albeit nearly two-and-a-half years ago, reportedly reached a peak audience of one million viewers."This might be controversial, but I'm just not a fan [of all-female cards] and I never have been," Scotland's Rankin says.She feels mixed-gender cards rather than segregating the two codes will attract more interest."I think if promoters are smart, they will start pushing women from where they're from," Rankin adds.Price has competed in Wales just once in nine pro bouts while London's highly talented unified super-bantamweight champion Ellie Scotney's past two fights have taken place on undercards in Manchester and Nottingham."Can Ellie be given an opportunity to sell out a smaller venue in London?" says Rankin."If women aren't getting the opportunities in Saudi, then let us be the champions at home and bring the crowds at home to watch."They might say they're not big ticket sellers but how do you become a big ticket seller if people from your area can't come and see you?"World champion Price cruises past Jonas to unify divisionPublished7 MarchDubois retains title with points win against ShinPublished7 MarchRelive Price's classy points win over JonasOnus on fighters to self-promote betterImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Caroline Dubois is one of Britain's five reigning female world championsShields – the self-proclaimed 'Greatest Woman of All Time' - played up to the American villain role against Marshall in a fight which stemmed from an amateur rivalry.There was no such animosity between Jonas and Price in a relatively subdued fight week. "Boxing is 50% talent and 50% entertainment," Rankin says."Female fighters have to take some ownership and start promoting themselves."Go work in your community, be active on social media, speak up in press conferences – however you want to sell yourself."Londoner Dubois is one of a few female fighters beginning to showcase the art of self-promotion, though."How audacious that she thinks she can beat me?" Dubois said at Wednesday's news conference, despite South Korean Shin saying nothing to prompt such an impassioned response.Dubois is a "breath of fresh air", according to Rankin, and the 25-year-old appears to understand the importance of putting on a show - even if it might be to her detriment. In the final round against Shin, Dubois took unnecessary risks and heavy hits in a bid to entertain her home crowd.British title fights, three-minute rounds & UFC's WhiteImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Ireland's Katie Taylor is arguably the biggest draw in female boxing but may be nearing the end of her careerBritish title fights are a mainstay in the men's code, producing countless classics including Anthony Joshua's showdown with Dillian Whyte in 2015.But they were only introduced in women's boxing in 2023, when Price beat Kirstie Bavington to become the inaugural champion."The British title can create more domestic dust-ups before we get onto the world level," Rankin says."For men, it's revered in every gym. Every guy would talk about winning the British title and it just isolated us a little bit."The conversation over whether females should adopt three-minute rounds like their male counterparts is one that splits opinion.But while those format changes may come with time, the future of women's boxing rests on the ever-evolving boxing landscape.UFC president Dana White has teamed up with Saudi organisers to create a new boxing league, which Rankin hopes can benefit female boxing.There is clearly work to be done, yet it simply cannot be ignored that women's boxing was banned until 1998 in the United Kingdom and 2001 in Ireland.And it has been less than a decade since Taylor's professional debut took it into the mainstream.To be where we are today – an all-female card at a venue steeped in boxing history with thousands in attendance – is cause for celebration.Related topicsBoxingBoxing schedule and results 2025Published1 day agoWatch every Born to Brawl episodePublished28 April 2024More boxing from the BBCNotifications, social media and more with BBC SportPublished31 JanuaryTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8908 viewing8.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
