The 2-1 loss has dropped them to 19th in the table, one point above the bottom three and level on points with Luton below them, ahead of a final day match against Bristol City next Saturday."A scare like this is 100 per cent [a wake-up call]. But all I'm focused on is the preparation and the performance next week. That's it. That's what we mentioned today."The missing bits were in both boxes and we should be having a completely different conversation, but I've said that too many times and that's been the one consistent flaw in our performances."When we've had the performances, when we've had the chances, we've not picked up enough three points off it and that's the tale of it. When we've not been at our best, we've not been able to get over the line like Plymouth have today."It's a tale of both boxes. We were wasteful in their box and they were clinical in ours. That's it."Everything else in between is propaganda when you're looking for results. Even though we controlled that bit, the game's always controlled with what happens in both boxes."19:08 26 AprilWigan Athletic 1-1 Blackpool, published at 19:08 26 AprilWigan Athletic 1-1 BlackpoolAttributionLeague OneComments68'We were superb' - Parker on win that sends Burnley toppublished at 18:24 26 April18:24 26 AprilImage source, PA MediaBurnley boss Scott Parker told BBC Radio Lancashire after his side's 5-0 victory at QPR:"It was a classy performance - I thought we were excellent."Everything we prepped for the game, the boys nailed it to a tee.

"Obviously you never know but hopefully we can get to a point where we'll have a bit of clarity on that."previous pagePage 1 of 42123456…42next pageInstagramTikTokFacebookXNews alertsReport an issueSend a storyWhy you can trust BBC NewsFrom other local news sitesLIVE: Latest as bomb squad deal with 'suspicious package' in city centreExternalLancashire Evening PostPendleside Hospice: Car raffle wheels back into townExternalBurnley Express'I'd plan ahead': Train operator Northern reminds travellers to check times ahead of timetable changesExternalBlackpool GazetteLocal elections 2025: Longridge with Bowland seeks new county councillor in six-way contestExternalBlog PrestonIn pictures: Rosemere’s 17th Walk in the Dark eventExternalBlog PrestonFlood alert issued for parts of LancasterExternalLancaster GuardianInformation about BBC links to other news sitesHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright © 2025 BBC.
