He said he would be aiming to throw for 160,000 points, which means achieving a score of almost 13,400 points per hour.He will be raising money for Prospect Hospice, having been inspired by a friend who received care at the facility.The attempt will take place on Saturday at The Carter's Rest pub in Wroughton.More news stories for WiltshireListen to the latest news for WiltshireMr Barkham said the initial points target he had been given by Guinness World Records for the new record bid was considerably higher than 160,000."Originally Guinness World Records wanted me to get 350,000 points, and that would have meant an average of 97 or 98 per throw, which is professional level."I'm not professional, so we had a little bit of contact with them and said you need to rethink this. They came back to me and said, go with 160,000."It is not the first time he has attempted such an endurance event, having completed a 24-hour darts marathon in 2008.'Work goes unnoticed'Mr Barkham said while achieving the record would be satisfying, it was raising money and awareness of the hospice that led him to make the attempt."Their work goes unnoticed by many but they do such a great job and if I can come away with a world record at the end, then happy days, but the main thing is to raise as much money as I can for Prospect," he said.Mr Barkham added with the clock running continually throughout he would have to limit his food and drink intake."The main thing is not to try to drink much. I'm not going to drink any alcohol, probably until about 10pm when I know I'm close. Hopefully I can celebrate with a beer at the end."He said he would continue throwing if he exceeded the 160,000 target, to try to "get as many points as possible".Follow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.
