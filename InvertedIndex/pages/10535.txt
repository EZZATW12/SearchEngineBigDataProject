He sits third in the standings and will look to consolidate his place in the season-ending play-offs."I wasn't as good as I was in the semis or quarters. Josh played fantastic to come back but thankfully I got a big lead or he would have blew me away," said Price."Winning these events gives you a good boost of confidence, regardless of whether you're playing well or not, it gives you great confidence for going forwards."Littler suffers first-round exit as Menzies triumphsPublished8 AprilThe last time I confess my real feelings - HumphriesPublished7 AprilBunting beats Aspinall to win International OpenPublished6 AprilLittler, 18, trailed 4-1 but fought back to lead 5-4 before being taken to a deciding leg by world number 26 Ritchie Edhouse.The current Premier League Darts champion then hit double five rather than double 20 when attempting a 120 checkout and Edhouse hit double tops with his first dart to earn the win.Defeat for Littler follows him being knocked out in the first round of the 11th event on Tuesday.He will also be in Premier League action on Thursday and will look to extend his six-point advantage at the top of the table.Edhouse lost 6-4 to the Netherlands' Gian van Veen in the quarter-finals.World number one Luke Humphries lost 6-5 to Belgium's Mario Vandenbogaerde in the last 32, while Michael van Gerwen was beaten 6-3 by Rhys Griffin in the opening round.Scotland's Cameron Menzies, who won Tuesday's event in Leicester, opted not to play on Wednesday.
