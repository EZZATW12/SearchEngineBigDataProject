Bunting told Sky Sports."But to get off the mark tonight and to win a night is such a special feeling."This is going to give me huge confidence and I can't wait to finish the campaign. I've really enjoyed it, even though I've not won a game until tonight."World champion Luke Littler remains top of the table despite a rare off night that saw him hit just two of his 13 darts at double in a 6-2 loss to Chris Dobey in the quarter-finals.Littler's lead has been cut to six points after world number one Humphries claimed five legs on the spin from 3-1 down to beat Rob Cross 6-3.Price is up to third after receiving a bye in the quarters following Michael van Gerwen's withdrawal with a shoulder injury.The Welshman enjoyed a convincing 6-2 win over Dobey in the semi-finals after Bunting had beaten Humphries by the same score in the other last-four tie.Bunting will also face Humphries in the last eight on Thursday, 10 April in Manchester, while Littler will take on Price on night 10.Relive Bunting's Premier League night nine win in BerlinPremier League Darts schedule, results, prize moneyPublished3 days agoPremier League Darts night nine resultsFinalStephen Bunting 6-5 Gerwyn PriceSemi-finalsStephen Bunting 6-2 Luke HumphriesChris Dobey 2-6 Gerwyn PriceQuarter-finalsNathan Aspinall 2-6 Stephen BuntingLuke Humphries 6-3 Rob CrossChris Dobey 6-2 Luke LittlerGerwyn Price bye (Michael van Gerwen withdrew because of injury)Premier League Darts tablePremier League Darts format and points systemPremier League Darts is played across 16 initial weeks in the league stage with quarter-finals, semi-finals and a final each night.Each of the eight players is guaranteed to face the other seven in the quarter-finals in weeks one to seven and 9-15, with week eight and week 16 fixtures done off the table. It means we will get fourth v fifth in Sheffield on the final league-stage night, with the play-off spots potentially on the line.Players earn two points per quarter-final win, an additional point if they win their semi-final and five for winning the night.The top four players after the group stage progress to the play-off night at London's O2 Arena on 23 May, with first facing fourth and second against third in a best-of-19-leg match. The final, which is the best of 21 legs, follows.If players are level on points after the 16 weeks then places are decided by nights won and then matches won.Premier League Darts night 10 order of playThursday, 10 April - ManchesterChris Dobey v Michael van GerwenNathan Aspinall v Rob CrossLuke Littler v Gerwyn PriceStephen Bunting v Luke HumphriesRelated topicsDartsComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 68Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8881 viewing8.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
