I'm settled even more coming into the next weeks."Premier League Darts night eight as it happenedPremier League Darts schedule, results, prize moneyPublished3 days agoHumphries ended a run of three successive Premier League losses by beating home favourite Chris Dobey in his quarter-final, before getting past Nathan Aspinall in the deciding leg of a high-quality semi-final.Cross and Aspinall - fifth and sixth in the table respectively - achieved crucial quarter-final wins to boost their hopes of reaching the play-offs on 29 May.Cross beat Gerwyn Price to move level on points with the 2021 world champion from Wales, while Aspinall overcame Michael van Gerwen 6-5 in his last-eight tie.Image source, PA MediaImage caption, Members of Newcastle United's Carabao Cup-winning squad, including recent England debutant Dan Burn (right), watched the action unfold at Utilita ArenaPremier League Darts night eight resultsFinalLuke Littler 6-1 Luke HumphriesSemi-finalsLuke Littler 6-3 Rob CrossLuke Humphries 6-5 Nathan AspinallQuarter-finalsLuke Littler 6-0 Stephen BuntingGerwyn Price 2-6 Rob CrossLuke Humphries 6-3 Chris DobeyMichael van Gerwen 5-6 Nathan AspinallPremier League Darts tablePremier League Darts format and points systemPremier League Darts is played across 16 initial weeks in the league stage with quarter-finals, semi-finals and a final each night.Each of the eight players is guaranteed to face the other seven in the quarter-finals in weeks one to seven and 9-15, with week eight and week 16 fixtures done off the table. It means we will get fourth v fifth in Sheffield on the final league-stage night, with the play-off spots potentially on the line.Players earn two points per quarter-final win, an additional point if they win their semi-final and five for winning the night.The top four players after the group stage progress to the play-off night at London's O2 Arena on 23 May, with first facing fourth and second against third in a best-of-19-leg match. The final, which is the best of 21 legs, follows.If players are level on points after the 16 weeks then places are decided by nights won and then matches won.Premier League Darts night nine order of playThursday, 3 April - BerlinNathan Aspinall v Stephen BuntingLuke Humphries v Rob CrossChris Dobey v Luke LittlerMichael van Gerwen v Gerwyn PriceRelated topicsDartsComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 321Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8038 viewing8k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
