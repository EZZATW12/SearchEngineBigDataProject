I have a good match with this course and I was really looking forward to the race," she told the BBC."We had a super strong field. It was perfect weather for me, I like it when it's warm. The crowd were really loud which helped."In the men's wheelchair race, fellow Paralympic champion Hug surged to his seventh victory in London - and fifth in a row - in 1:25:25.A four-second gap was established by the 10km mark and although Japan's Tomoki Suzuki managed to keep the Swiss great within his sights for a time, eventually Hug was able to leave him trailing.Suzuki did hold on to finish second with the Netherlands' Jetze Plat in third."I broke away from the group early and then it was like a time trial, it was really tough," Hug said. "But I enjoyed it with the crowd and everything. It was really fantastic."I felt the presence [of Suzuki] a lot. I tried to push as much as possible. It was really tough but luckily the last few kilometres, I didn't see him anymore and I felt more comfortable then."Great Britain's eight-time winner David Weir, competing in the event for the 26th straight year, finished sixth.Eden Rainbow-Cooper was the top Briton in the women's race as she crossed the line in fourth.Image source, PA MediaImage caption, Marcel Hug won the men's wheelchair race for the fifth year in a rowLondon Marathon: Women's wheelchair race resultsCatherine Debrunner (Swi) - 1:34:18Susannah Scaroni (USA) - 1:38:08Manuela Schar (Swi) - 1:41:06London Marathon: Men's wheelchair race resultsMarcel Hug (Swi) - 1:25:25Tomoki Suzuki (Jap) - 1:26:09Jetze Plat (Ned) - 1:26:49Related topicsDisability SportAthleticsTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8907 viewing8.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
