My heart rate was elevated when I was just walking around and that was causing chest pains and other symptoms."From training every day to not being to train at all and not even being able to even go out for a walk or do something simple was pretty tough."I made the decision to focus on my recovery and forget about the Games because I needed to get healthy again and live a normal life."Hall and her husband and fellow wheelchair racer Callum decided to focus on having a family and after welcoming son Luca in February 2023, she returned to training and competed in the Manchester 10K race when he was 12 weeks old.Shortly afterwards, she discovered she was pregnant again and Bonnie arrived in March 2024."I've had a period of almost three years of being in and out of training and with the Caesarean, it's like I've started from scratch," she said."I feel like I've had a career before children and a career after and it's really hard to compare the two because they're just very different."Before I became unwell I was kind of feeling a bit tired and I felt like I didn't really know which direction I was going in."Having that forced break with the illness and then having the children made me realise that I do really love it."Image source, Jade HallImage caption, Hall's family play an important part in her sporting lifeHall finished seventh in the New York Marathon in November, seven months after Bonnie's birth, and on Sunday returns to London, which she last raced in 2018.The field for the women's race is led by two-time winner and Paralympic champion Catherine Debrunner of Switzerland and American Susannah Scaroni, who won Monday's Boston Marathon. Briton Eden Rainbow-Cooper will hope to improve on her fourth place in Boston after struggling with a back injury since early last year.In the men's race, Swiss 'Silver Bullet' Marcel Hug will be aiming for his fifth win in a row - and seventh overall - to close in on David Weir's record of eight victories.For Hall, who is now focused solely on wheelchair racing rather than triathlon, the next Paralympics in Los Angeles in 2028 are a consideration but her short-term goals are more important."LA is at the back of my mind but I want to see how the next year goes and how I can earn my place back on the marathon circuit, so I feel like it's one step at a time for me right now," she said."I'm not just sacrificing my time any more, I'm sacrificing time with the children to go and train."I'm enjoying it - probably more than I ever have - and I want my children to be able to see me doing something positive with my life"Now it just feels different and it feels like it's bigger because it's a part of their life too."Related topicsDisability SportMore on this storyLondon Marathon 2025 - everything you need to knowPublished2 days ago'Once a fool to become an expert' - Yee set for marathon debutPublished4 days ago'Our daughters will be with us,' say dads of Southport victims running London MarathonPublished4 days agoTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8907 viewing8.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
