"We had it in Pyeongchang [in 2018], for example, one session it was 26C. It was the Paralympic spring Games."Virtually 100% of snow at the 2022 Winter Olympics and Paralympics in Beijing was artificial, which has an environmental cost itself, but temperatures in excess of 20C caused melting, external and competition schedules had to be changed.On the potential of similar happening next year, Parsons said:  "From the data we have we are not that concerned, but we are alert and we will have the measures in place to react, but also it's a sign of global warmth which is something that in sport we need to react to."I hope world leaders can address that as well, not only focusing on sport but on the future of this planet, because it's a reality and the quality of snow in sport events is just one symptom of it."The 2026 Games will mark the 50th anniversary of the first Winter Paralympics, which were held in Ornskoldsvik, Sweden.About 600 athletes are set to descend on Italy in 12 months' time, with the action split between Cortina (Para alpine skiing, Para-snowboarding and wheelchair curling), Milan (Para-ice hockey) and Val di Fiemme (Para-cross country skiing and Para-biathlon).As ticket sales open, Parsons said having the winter Games in Europe offers a "great opportunity" to build on "the most successful Paralympics ever" in Paris in 2024.Related topicsWinter SportsDisability SportTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8399 viewing8.4k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
