Physical activity plays an important role in the healthy development of children, and taking part in PE and sports benefits children’s physical, mental, and social well-being.Currently 1.5 million children in England have special educational needs or are disabled, but only one in four disabled children take part in physical activity at school. Super Movers for Every Body is designed to help tackle this issue and get everybody moving.We want all children to enjoy being active, and we want disabled pupils to feel more included in sport at school, and to encourage sporting allies. We want to harness the power of sport and the passion for the Paralympic Games and Premier League to introduce more inclusive sports to teachers and schools.With inspiring films and resources produced with the help of Activity Alliance, BBC Sport, Boccia England, Channel 4 and the Youth Sport Trust, we hope every primary school pupil can join in and take part in inclusive activities in PE and sport, at school and at home.Watch our film to find out from three Gold medal winning Paralympians: Hannah Cockroft, Ellie Simmonds and David Smith, why inclusive sport and Super Movers for Every Body is so important.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Video TranscriptVideo TranscriptEllie Simmonds OBE: Super Movers for Every Body is so important to me because I think yes it's about the next generation, but it's also about grassroots, making sure that no matter who you are, no matter what disability you have, you can move, you can get active, you can be included.Hannah Cockcroft OBE, DL: Sport isn't just about fitness and health. It teaches us so many different things. It teaches leadership, communication skills. It helps us make friendship groups. It helps us have more confidence in our bodies. It is so good for every area of your life.David Smith OBE: I know there's a lot of people with my sort of disability who are smart, articulate, but without a competitive outlet, so I want to make a difference.Ellie: Educating teachers, school kids to make sure no one is left out is so, so important.Hannah: A lot of people learn from an early age, oh disabled people can't do sport or they can't do this or they can't do that. Whereas if we make it inclusive right from the very start, then that sets you up for life then. People start looking at, well, this is how I can include that person. I know that for a long time I didn't feel included, so why not make it so that everyone can take part?David: Sport is important, so you can learn communication. You can learn working together, tactics, problem solving.Ellie: Any child out there can do PE and can do sport, but just in a different way.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Watch this film with British Sign LanguageThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Watch this film with audio descriptionThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Watch this film with British Sign Language and audio descriptionVisit the Super Movers for Every Body website to find free teaching and learning resources for Paralympic sports.
