Eight points in arrears at the break, Down did attempt to run at Donegal in the second half and while it did bear some fruit, it was too late at that stage.Points from the busy Eugene Branagan, Havern and Miceal Rooney helped Down to their early 0-3 to 0-1 advantage but an Oisin Gallen point and McBrearty two-pointer put Donegal ahead before Danny Magill brought the sides level.Then came Down's first missed goal chance as McGeough failed to pick out the unmarked McCarthy.Donegal's response was ruthless as a Murphy point was followed by McBrearty's goal.A Ryan McHugh score and typical Dara O Baoill two-pointer helped stretch Donegal's lead with McBrearty, Murphy (two) and blood substitute Jamie Brennan tagging on more points during the champions' dominant second quarter.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Donegal led Down 1-12 to 0-7 at half-time at St Tiernach's ParkDonegal lose rhythm in second halfAs Down adopted a running game, the first of two Havern second-half two-pointers helped cut Donegal's advantage to six after 40 minutes only for another O Baoill score to start a run of three unanswered scores in response.To their credit, Down didn't wilt as they fired the next three scores but Conor Laverty's side were never able to get close enough to put Donegal's lead under any real threat.By that stage, Donegal were running their bench with Murphy and McBrearty among the players who had already departed, which did seem to disrupt their rhythm somewhat.A thumping two-point free from Langan extended Donegal's lead to eight in the 58th minute and after Havern replied, Down's last chance came and went with Millar's missed goal chance.Donegal also had their goal chances late on with Down keeper Ronan Burns brilliantly denying O Baoill and substitute Aaron Doherty in the closing 15 minutes.But the misses ultimately mattered not as it was job done for Donegal, who now must prepare for another provincial final with Armagh which will take place at Clones despite the speculation that it could be moved to Croke Park.Down: R Burns; P McCarthy, P Fegan, C Doherty; R Magill, P Laverty, M Rooney (0-1), D Guinness (0-1), R McEvoy (0-1); D Magill (0-2), O Murdock (capt), E Branagan (0-3); J Guinness, P Havern (0-8), J McGeough.Subs: S Millar for R Magill 50, F McElroy for McCarthy 55, C Mooney for J Guinness 49, C McCrickard for McGeough 58.Not used: J O'Hare, A Crimmins, R McCormack, A McClements, D Scullion,  G McKibben, P Brooks, Donegal: S Patton (0-1) F Roarty, B McCole, P Mogan; R McHugh, S McMenamin, C Moore (0-1); O Gallen (0-1), C Thompson; D O Baoill (0-4), C Thompson, S O'Donnell; P McBrearty (capt) (1-4), M Murphy (0-3), C O'Donnell (0-2).Subs: J Brennan (0-1) for Murphy 45, O McFadden Ferry for Roarty 52, A Doherty for C O'Donnell 58, N O'Donnell for McBrearty 55, J McGee for Gallen 50.Not used: G Mulreaney, C McColgan, O Doherty, E Hugh, J MacCeallabhui, H McFadden Blood: Brennan for C O'Donnell 31, O'Donnell back HTReferee: J McQuillan (Cavan)Related topicsGaelic GamesNorthern Ireland SportTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8993 viewing9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Northern Ireland sportThe 'rugby student' stepping up to lead IrelandPre-contract agreements - why are they different in NI?Record-breaker Dunlop 'breaks mould' of modern sporting heroesMeet Jude McAtamney - the New York Giants kicker from Derry Elsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
