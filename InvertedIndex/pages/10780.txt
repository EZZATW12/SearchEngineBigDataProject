Having beaten Derry in the preliminary round, Donegal looked on course for another convincing win as they built a six-point lead at half-time. But Monaghan roared back in the second half with three two-pointers in the space of six third-quarter minutes from Conor McCarthy, Jack McCarron and Micheal Bannigan. Donegal managed to push themselves back into a four-point cushion in the closing stages, but a Ryan McAnespie score and Dessie Ward's two-pointer left the game in the balance in a gripping climax in front of a 16,200-strong crowd at St Tiernach's Park. Monaghan's chance to force extra-time fell to Ward, but when his two-pointer curled wide, Donegal breathed a huge sigh of relief as they set up a semi-final with Down on 27 April. Ulster SFC: Donegal survive Monaghan comeback to reach last four - as it happenedDonnelly 'proud' as Fermanagh's agonising wait goes onPublished20 AprilOn the back of their 10-point success over Derry a fortnight ago, Donegal were firm pre-match favourites and lived up to that billing during a dominant first-half display against the newly crowned Division Two champions. With Monaghan firing wides and struggling to claim their own kick-outs, Donegal duly capitalised and soared into a 0-9 to 0-2 lead after 20 minutes. Ciaran Thompson was excellent in the first half, scoring five points, while Peadar Mogan chipped in with three scores from play from corner-back, ultimately ending the game with 0-4 from play. Daire O Baoill continued his fine form after hitting 1-4 against Derry with two first-half points while Michael Murphy hit 0-3, which included a two-pointed free. Sensing the uphill task facing his side, Monaghan boss Gabriel Bannigan sent on Jack McCarron and Micheal McCarville to breathe new life into the Monaghan challenge, but it was a Ward two-pointer and a Micheal Bannigan free that kept the home side alive at the break.

After Donegal substitute Oisin Gallen extended his side's lead to seven points, Monaghan produced their best spell of the match with McCarthy, McCarron and Bannigan all raising orange flags in quick succession. Bannigan's two-pointer left Monaghan just one adrift at 0-16 to 0-15 and threatening to replicate Down's second-half comeback against Fermanagh at Brewster Park on Saturday. However, after Mogan and Bannigan exchanged scores, Donegal hit the next three without reply through Michael Langan - who chalked up an impressive 0-4 total - Patrick McBrearty and substitute Jamie Brennan to open up a four-point cushion with 10 minutes remaining. To Monaghan's credit, they kept plugging away and were given a lifeline when McAnespie's score was swiftly followed by a spectacular two-pointer from Ward. With the next play crucial, Monaghan again worked the ball to Ward on the left flank, but after turning away from Aaron Doherty, the defender's two-pointed effort drifted to the left. From Patton's resultant kick-out, Monaghan won a sideline ball, and while Farney boss Bannigan was incensed when referee David Coldrick blew the full-time whistle before his side could launch another attack, the hooter appeared to sound before the ball was put back in play. At that moment, as the Monaghan players fell to their knees in agony, Donegal were left to celebrate a hard-fought victory. While Donegal quickly turn their attentions to next week's last-four encounter with Down in Clones, Monaghan's championship campaign is paused until the All-Ireland group stages begin next month.Image source, InphoImage caption, Monaghan were furious when they were denied one last attack by referee David ColdrickTeams and scorersMonaghan: Rory Beggan (0-1, '45); Ryan Wylie, Ryan O'Toole, Dylan Walshe; Kieran Duffy, Dessie Ward (0-6, 2 2pt), Conor McCarthy (0-3, 1 2pt); Micheal McCarville, Gary Mohan (0-1); Stephen O'Hanlon, Micheal Bannigan (0-5, 1 2pt, 1f), Ciaran McNulty; David Garland, Andrew Woods, Ryan McAnespie (0-1).Subs: Gavin McPhillips for McCarville (32 mins), Joel Wilson for McNulty (62 mins), Jack McCarron (1 2pt) for Garland (32 mins), Stephen Mooney (0-2) for Woods (54 mins), Karl O'Connell for Byrne (66 mins).
