For me to come back, I would really need to be excited by it," Biles told French sports newspaper L'Equipe., external"You're going to tell me that the perspective of the Games in Los Angeles is fascinating. And I will be there, whether on the apparatus or in the stands, I still haven't decided."Biles previously said she felt like a failure following a disappointing Tokyo Olympics in which she was aiming for six gold medals but instead left with a silver and bronze.She added that "2028 seems so far away" and "my body ages". "I felt it in Paris," said Biles, who was crowned Sportswoman of the Year for a record-equalling fourth time at the Laureus World Sports Awards."At the end of the competition, I went back to the village, I took the elevator and my body literally collapsed - I got sick for 10 days."So, to be honest, I don't know. We'll see."Related topicsGymnasticsOlympic GamesComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 59Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8108 viewing8.1k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
