"Even though we've lost the gym, they're still pushing themselves to do their best and to train hard and to reach their goals."Facundo ArrizabalagaOlivia has decided to represent the Poland squad Kirk Zammit, who co-manages the charity that runs the East London Gymnastics Club (ELGC), said a long-term home needed to be found for the club soon."If a new permanent facility isn't found soon, the club will face closing their elite competitive squad programme," he said."We have GB squad gymnasts currently on target for the next Junior European Championships who may struggle to continue in the sport if a new location isn't found."The club is understood to have viewed a number of locations but has not secured somewhere suitable.The East London Gymnastic Centre opened its doors in 1997 with the help of National Lottery funding and has supported the careers of several top Olympians.Hollywood actor Tom Holland also trained at the club in the past. A Linea Homes spokesperson previously told the LDRS: "Our plans for the site focus on retaining the building and ensuring its financial viability. We have secured a new tenant who will bring significant health and social benefits to the community."Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.
