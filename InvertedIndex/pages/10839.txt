"And in funerals, there's no returns or refunds. On the day you've got to be absolutely immaculate for the family and the people you're looking after."Teamwork as well is a massive part [and] for funerals it's all about planning."'Fitter and healthier'Steven said his start in gymnastics "was a very common one"."As a child I was hyperactive, running round the house," he said. "And it was an easy transition for my parents to say 'get that energy spent so we can sleep at night!'"So from eight to 18 I dedicated my life to gymnastics."For more than a decade he said he trained for 40 hours a week, until he "got to the age where I wanted to have a McDonalds and go out and I just fell out of love with the sport".From then on, Steven said he "didn't enter a gymnastics centre for 20 years".As was the case for many people, the pandemic really made him take stock of his life"It was really after Covid that I thought how to get fitter and healthier and work on my wellbeing," said Steven."And I just thought I'd go back and see what happens."Within a year, he said he was asked to take part in the British Championships "and it's been a rollercoaster since then".He won a bronze medal in the 2023 all-around category.In last year's Over 40s event, he won silver in the all-around event.Steven will represent Great Britain again at two international events later this year.Listen to the best of BBC Radio Lancashire on BBC Sounds and follow BBC Lancashire on Facebook, X and Instagram and watch BBC North West Tonight on BBC iPlayer.ManchesterAccringtonRelatedManchester Marathon 2025 in pictures22 hrs agoManchesterRoad closures as city hosts marathon and parade1 day agoManchesterBoy, 17, and man suffer serious stab injuries3 days agoManchesterMore2 days agoLetter to RAF darling found in uniform 80 years onThe letter, signed by Jean, says she is counting the days until her "darling" returns for Christmas.2 days agoLancashire13 Apr 2025College receives £1.5m grant to upgrade buildingsIt is hoped the government cash will enable the college to attract and retain students.13 Apr 2025Lancashire30 Mar 2025Councillors blame football club for noise row The football club must not host live music events in its hospitality suite because of noise.30 Mar 2025Lancashire24 Mar 2025Lost toddler reunited with 'frantic' parentsOfficers found the child, separated from its "frantic" parents during a Lancashire Police day of action.24 Mar 2025Lancashire18 Mar 2025Music ban football club's owner criticises councilAccrington Stanley lost the right to host functions following a flurry of noise complaints.18 Mar 2025LancashireBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.
