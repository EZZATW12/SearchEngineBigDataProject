"Not only the level of tricks and lifts, which we knew he could do but the level of dance he has created has just been unbelievable."I don't think I'll ever have another partner like him. "He's so incredible and inspiring."Rhys was joined by children dressed as Spiderman to support his dream of being like Spiderman one dayRhys said he had not been sure if he would reach the final, but said the fact he has made it this far and people continue to watch and support him is "a job well done"."It's very different to a gymnastics competition where it really comes down to your performance and the score that you get," he said."This is a public vote – it's half the vote each week and even coming down to the final it's only the public vote."So it's very a different kind of competition."But the support has been great and I mean – today there were kids coming in as Spiderman because it was a dream of mine as a kid to be Spiderman, so to be able to perform it live on TV in the form of a dance was a special feeling."'Out of my comfort zone'All four couples participating in Sunday's final will complete two dances.Rhys and Laura confirmed they would be bringing back the Spiderman themed dance from movie week where they were awarded 10 points from each of the judges. They will also perform a freestyle dance.Rhys said bringing the winning "glitterball" trophy home would be a "really nice representation for gymnastics" and for people in his hometown."I was definitely out of my comfort zone this entire show and just accepting that you're a part of doing something special, it's a good message to have."Mum wants the main prizeTracy McClenaghan said she did not know her son Rhys could danceTracy McClenaghan, Rhys's mum, said she did not think she could be any prouder of her son."We're really excited, it's something completely different for us."We are used to sports events to cheer on a gymnast and now all of a sudden we're at dance events. "I don't even know how this happened."Tracy admitted that when Rhys started the competition she did not think he would reach the final but now she believes he can win.She said she would "love to have the glitterball back in Newtownards"."I had no clue he could even dance. "He said to me a few months ago 'I'm going to do Dancing with the Stars' and I looked at him and said 'can you dance?' and he said: 'I don't know, I'm sure I'll pick it up'."That's Rhys' typical attitude really, he just loves a challenge."Suzie Allen and her daughters Summer and Savannah are cheering on Rhys and LauraSuzie Allen's daughters Summer and Savannah attend gymnastics classes at Rhys' home gym. She said both Rhys and Laura are brilliant role models."The girls go to Origin gymnastics, but they also dance, so they love what he's doing, they'll hopefully be able to do [so] one day as well and be as fit as him."Excitement at McClenaghan's gym as gymnast wins goldMcClenaghan wins pommel horse gold at Olympics'Emotions through the roof' as McClenaghan makes historyNewtownardsNorthern IrelandRelatedWoman dies and eight injured after three vehicles crash3 days agoNorthern IrelandJimmy Page's daughter 'hits right note' with portraits12 Apr 2025Northern IrelandXL bully owner thought she was 'going to die' during attack4 Apr 2025Northern IrelandMore59 mins agoAirbus confirms deal for Spirit operations in BelfastThe deal was first announced in July last year as part of a wider break up of the Spirit business.59 mins agoNorthern Ireland2 hrs agoScrambler bike warning over danger of driving in residential areasIt comes after a man was taken to hospital after the electric scrambler bike he was riding was involved in a crash with a car in east Belfast.2 hrs agoNorthern Ireland2 hrs agoDaughter of murdered MP calls for Kneecap apologyVideo emerged of a 2023 gig appearing to show a band member saying: "The only good Tory is a dead Tory."2 hrs agoNorthern Ireland3 hrs agoEx-Irish police officer to lead Disappeared investigationMr Henry's appointment marks the first time someone from An Garda Síochána has taken the role. 3 hrs agoNorthern Ireland5 hrs ago'Trailblazer' to be honoured at Royal PortrushMay Hezlet, from Aghadowey, won her first golf competition at the age of 11. 5 hrs agoNorthern IrelandBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.
