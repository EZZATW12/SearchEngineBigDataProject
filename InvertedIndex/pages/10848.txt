They were based on a partial and incomplete investigation and relied on concocted evidence."Mrs Trikomiti has been a judge for many years without any complaint, let alone sanction."She has worked hard to ensure that all competitions are judged fairly, independently and without bias and she fully intends to continue this work when her appeal is concluded."Trikomiti's daughter, Chrystalleni, represented Cyprus at the 2012 London Olympics and won two gold medals in rhythmic gymnastics at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi.European Gymnastics said it would consult with lawyers before considering an appeal.The Cyprus Gymnastics Federation said it would "thoroughly review" the ruling."We are committed to taking all necessary actions in accordance with the law and ensuring that the appropriate measures are implemented," it said.Related topicsGymnasticsOlympic GamesTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8899 viewing8.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
