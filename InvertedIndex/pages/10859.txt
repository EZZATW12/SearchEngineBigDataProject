With trampolining, you have to be a little bit brave and a bit stupid or crazy to do it. "So it does make it more special If you've gone through challenges and been able to overcome them and reached that pinnacle of the sport."Her latest adventure will see her training with the world-famous Canadian circus troupe."Plan A would be to do that and then come back for the LA Olympics," she said."When I compete and there's a crowd, I see it as a performance just as much as I see it as a competition. "I love that side of it, that performance side, with the costumes and the make-up and the set and the music and the team and the camaraderie."I feel better and stronger now than I did in my early twenties. "I love the feeling of flying through the sky and spinning and turning, and the G forces that we get."I can't imagine doing anything different at the moment."You can follow BBC Dorset on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.
