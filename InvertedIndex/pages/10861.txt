Three years later, at the 1984 Los Angeles Games, the 16-year-old became the first American to secure the Olympic all-around title. Karolyi, alongside his wife Marta, helped to shape United States gymnastics over the subsequent decades. Karolyi retired from coaching following the Atlanta Games in 1996 but was hired as the US' national team co-ordinator in 1999, spending just over a year in the role. The Karolyis also ran a training centre in Texas, known as the "Karolyi ranch". It became the US women's national team training centre in 2001 when Marta was named the women's national team co-ordinator.However, USA Gymnastics halted use of the venue in 2018 following the abuse scandal involving former team doctor Larry Nassar.Nassar was sentenced to between 40 to 175 years in prison after pleading guilty to 10 counts of sexual assault against girls and young women, as well as the possession of child pornography. During the scandal, over a dozen former gymnasts came forward, external saying the Karolyis were part of a system that created an oppressive culture that allowed Nassar's behaviour to run unchecked. Some of the victims also alleged they were abused by Nassar at the training centre in Texas. However, Karolyi and his wife told CNN in 2018, external that they were unaware of Nassar's crimes and denied any wrongdoing.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Retton (left) celebrates with Karolyi (right) at the 1984 GamesRelated topicsGymnasticsTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8899 viewing8.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
