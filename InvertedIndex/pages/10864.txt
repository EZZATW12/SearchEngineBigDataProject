We were so determined to win the game, so good!Oscar: What an ending! Yasin Ayari - where do I start? He bossed the midfield and scored a goal to fit his perfect performance. Kaoru Mitoma was an amazing super-sub, using his pace down the wing. Carlos Baleba was in a different position to where he usually plays, but he played it really well. The whole team played amazing to comeback from 1-2 to win 3-2. Just amazing!Tom: An absolutely incredible end to the game. A rollercoaster of emotions; however we cannot rely on late equalisers and winners. We need to build on this result and try to get maximum points. If West Ham hadn't switched off towards the end of the game, we would have gone away with no points. Fabian Hurzeler is a lucky man!Noddy: No goalkeeper in the world would have been able to save those two goals.Chris: A decent 'paper-over-the-cracks' performance at last, but that still can't win over a disappointing season. European football is only a very slim chance given Fulham and Bournemouth are still collecting points, our on and off form and unpredictable player performances. It really has been a wasted run-in so far. A change is needed at the top for next season.West Ham fansSteve: A better performance - very encouraging. We have nothing to play for, admittedly. It's about building for next year now. I think Potter should be given time, I'm starting to see us on the front foot. We move on.Justin: Poor, lacklustre, abysmal! Take your pick. Potter has shown no tactical ability in his starting line-ups or substitutions. The team has shown no signs of improvement under him. I wasn't enamoured by his appointment. To only avoid a relegation battle because the three teams below us are so dire just isn't good enough for a man who was at one time going to be England's new manager.Anthony: We were doing well and then we brought on Vladimir Coufal and he immediately helped Brighton score. It was a poor decision from Potter. They are playing well under him, and gradually improving, but they are either missing scoring opportunities or giving goals away by poor defending. Plenty of work to be done this summer.Rod: Shocking, embarrassing, limp, laughable, clueless and unprofessional. Did I miss anything?Peter: No amount of feeble excuses from Potter will disguise the fact that he has failed to fulfil his mandate.Baleba has 'got that in his locker'published at 08:0808:08Chris WiseFinal Score reporter at Amex StadiumImage source, Getty ImagesAn auxiliary centre-half scoring a screamer to win the match with the last kick of the game? Sounds like the stuff of fantasy.Perhaps that is why the reaction to Brighton's Carlos Baleba's sublime goal against West Ham was met with almost disbelieving scenes of chaos at Amex Stadium.But to nab a well-used sporting phrase - 'he's got that in his locker'.Baleba's attributes are well spread - physically imposing, athletic, comfortable with the ball, and clearly a scorer of very decent goals.It will be interesting to see if Brighton persist with Baleba as a centre-half. Speaking to several people around the club at the weekend, the general consensus was that he would make an excellent defender. Mind you, he might need some convincing if the club do think that is a plausible route.Fabian Hurzeler will hope that moment revitalises their season, because the headlines could have been very different at the weekend. They have still got Newcastle and Liverpool to come at home, so there was a real sense that they needed this win.Gossip: Van Hecke on Newcastle shortlist published at 07:4707:47Newcastle United's shortlist for defensive reinforcements includes Dutchman Jan Paul van Hecke from Brighton.

It was an amazing feeling."I think we deserved the three points but it wasn't our best game to be fair. We can play much better. I think we dropped our intensity when I scored my first goal and they then came into the game and started to create some chances."In the end, I think we showed a good winning mentality. We didn't stop believing today."The winning mentality we have in this team, amongst this group of lads, is unbelievable. I'm grateful to have them as teammates. Everyone is training hard and staying humble, and for sure it paid off."On scoring his first goal for the club: "I'm so happy about it. I can't describe it really, it's amazing."On getting back into the starting XI: "I think I've been playing a lot. I think I'm deserving it. I show every time that I deserve to play, and today I scored my first goal so I'm happy."Listen to the full interview here19:29 26 AprilNotts bowlers set up winning chance against Sussex, published at 19:29 26 AprilNotts bowlers set up winning chance against SussexAttributionCricketComments2618:27 26 AprilWe always had the belief - Hurzeler reacts to comeback win over West Ham.

You saw the reaction from the players, the crowd, the staff and the fans. We really wanted to win so this was a special moment."You always have to believe and trust your ability - and that is what the guys did today. They had setbacks but they reacted in the right way. They stayed together, especially the way skipper Lewis [Dunk] led the team was impressive."Brighton stem poor run with defiant comebackpublished at 18:00 26 April18:00 26 AprilJoe NelsonBBC Sport journalistImage source, Getty ImagesGoing into Saturday's game against West Ham, Brighton had not won in the Premier League since beating Fulham at the start of March.Fabian Hurzeler's side have struggled with consistency this term, having gone unbeaten in their first nine.These fluctuating performances mean the Seagulls have dropped out of Champions League and Europa League contention, but against West Ham they got back to winning ways.After Yasin Ayari's early stunner was overturned by second-half efforts from Mohammed Kudus and Tomas Soucek, Hurzeler's team could have felt sorry for themselves and settled for another defeat but they didn't.They piled on the pressure before Kaoru Mitoma's header and Carlos Baleba's fine strike took them from defeat to victory in a matter of three late minutes.The jubilant celebrations at the Amex Stadium demonstrated that Brighton believe they still have plenty to play for this season.17:52 26 AprilElectric shock as funfair ride hit power cable, published at 17:52 26 AprilElectric shock as funfair ride hit power cableAttributionSussexBrighton 3-2 West Ham: Key statspublished at 17:34 26 April17:34 26 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesOnly in 2022-23 (62) and 1981-82 (52) have Brighton earned more points in a top-flight season than their 51 points this term.Six of Kaoru Mitoma's nine Premier League goals for Brighton this season have come in 2025, netting as a substitute in each of his past two appearances.'We have shown great character after a tough run'published at 17:12 26 April17:12 26 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesBrighton captain Lewis Dunk has been speaking to Sky Sports following the win: "That was good fun. We started excellently but, once we went 1-0 up, we stopped playing and the intensity dropped."In the second half, they started better but we showed character to win the game."I'm just buzzing. We have shown great character after a tough run. It is massive to keep us in the race to where we want to go."On Carlos Baleba's goal: "We have worked on tactics around needing a goal in the last minute, but that wasn't a tactic. But he put it in the top corner so the gaffer can't say anything."Brighton 3-2 West Ham - send us your thoughtspublished at 16:54 26 April16:54 26 AprilWere you at the game or following from elsewhere?Have your say on Brighton's performanceWhat did you make of West Ham's display?Come back to this page on Monday to find a selection of your replies14:53 26 AprilArt gallery opens in former hardware store site, published at 14:53 26 AprilArt gallery opens in former hardware store siteAttributionSussexprevious pagePage 1 of 42123456…42next pageInstagramTikTokFacebookXNews alertsReport an issueSend a storyWhy you can trust BBC NewsFrom other local news sitesSussex Police releases new image of missing 86-year-old woman with links to Eastbourne, Bexhill and HastingsExternalSussex ExpressIn 28 pictures: Classic cars shine in the sun in Hastings Old TownExternalSussex ExpressPolice manhunt launched after incident at storeExternalBrighton & Hove ArgusDiocese speaks out after ex-vicar guilty of child sex offencesExternalBrighton & Hove ArgusSussex struggle to make it to day three against NottinghamshireExternalBrighton and Hove NewsCarbon Based Lifeforms play first ever Brighton & Hove gigExternalBrighton and Hove NewsInformation about BBC links to other news sitesHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright © 2025 BBC.
