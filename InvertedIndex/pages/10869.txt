"Obviously it's a massive achievement and I agree, it doesn't feel real yet," said Sam."It's always been a dream to represent Great Britain."Splitz Gymnastics ClubArchie Pickles (standing) and Samuel Austin have been competing together for three yearsBoth gymnasts started at Splitz aged seven and competed at different levels in different partnerships before coming together to form a men's pair.Acrobatic gymnastics involves pairs or groups of gymnasts performing routines to music whilst balancing together, throwing or catching each other and tumbling.Since their first competition together in February 2022 in which they placed first, the pair have gone on to win other major titles in Great Britain, including the National Finals and British Championships. Carmen BenhamThe pair will be competing in the Grand Prix in Poland in NovemberThey have set up a GoFundMe page and have already reached their target of  £3,000 towards the high costs of competing. "People don't realise how expensive it is, like the travel, even just going to the competition, the fees, and the tracksuits which are lovely, but expensive," said Mr Pickles.'Good rapport'"It has all happened really fast," said coach Carmen Benham."We never really get time to calm down; it's just build, build, build and you hit that point where you're at the peak, the competition happens, then you come down for a bit, but you've got to go back up for the next one."They've got a really good rapport together and I think that's how they've achieved this."It's been an amazing, amazing journey, and it will continue to be an amazing journey," added Ms Benham.Follow BBC Somerset on Facebook and X.
