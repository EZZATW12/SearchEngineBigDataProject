There is then a requirement for a fresh going description on the day when entries are declared, 48 hours before the raceday, and then on the raceday itself.Andrew Cooper, clerk of the course at Sandown Park and Epsom Downs racecourses, said: "All the trainers like and appreciate an update as early as you can on raceday morning, so you are probably trying to do it by 7am."So most clerks of the course would have their first walk of the course at 6am. That means walking around in broad daylight in summer, or wandering around by pitch black in winter."Irrigation methods can be used to artificially water the ground.The going is measured using a special instrument called the GoingStick, which was made mandatory at all British racecourses in 2009 with the intention of giving an "objective numerical reading"."The industry was desperate to find an objective measure of the ground, rather than people like me walking around with a wooden stick," Cooper explained."It produces a statistical reading on a scale of 0-15 from the wettest to firmest - if it gives zero, you would probably be taking it in the bath, 15 would be on the M4."You take three readings at 30 locations on the circuit of the racecourse, and the probe averages them all out to give a numerical reading of the going."The probe is measuring two things - penetration and shear - and its movement in the soil replicates the action of the horse's hoof."On a raceday itself, there is insufficient time for a clerk of the course to do a full inspection.However, the going might be changed during racing based on feedback from participants, mostly experienced jockeys.What impact does it have on welfare?Welfare has become a subject of intense scrutiny in horse-racing, and Cooper said clerks of the course feel pressure not only to provide an accurate going description but as consistent a surface as possible across a whole racecourse."If there is one piece [of the course] that is unraceable or unsafe that could scupper you," he said."From a track point of view in terms of welfare side of things, what's important is for a racecourse to be as consistent as it can be - physically consistent -  you don't want to be going from a firm to a wet patch. Consistency of surface is a fundamental aim."For jump racing, the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) instruction is that racecourses should aim for ground officially described as 'good' for jump racing, and 'good to firm' in flat racing.If the ground is too firm, then racing won't take place on welfare grounds, but is there such a thing as ground that is too wet to race on?"For jump racing there is far greater tolerance and acceptance to race on deep, wet ground. You would be calling off a day's flat racing far sooner in wet conditions than in jump racing," said Cooper."The clerk has got to decide if this is safe, acceptable ground. Jump racing is fundamentally a winter sport, with older, stronger horses."The key element in really soft ground is if it has a bottom to it, you might put the stick in it but after six or seven inches you are hitting something sound, and that is OK."The key thing with jumping, as long as your take-offs and landings and approaches to takeoffs and landings are relatively sound, you can tolerate muddier, deeper ground in between the jumps."More questions answered...How does the F1 points system work?How does the BBC pick FA Cup fixtures?All you need to know about Netball Super League 2025Related topicsHorse RacingTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9722 viewing9.7k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
