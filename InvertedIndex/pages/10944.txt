It's just huge. It's like something out of a Disney film," he said.Nick Rockett won at Aintree from last year's winner I Am Maximus with fellow stablemate Grangeclare West in third.Willie is normally coolness personified, the even-tempered master of jump racing.Last year, when he became the first trainer to saddle one hundred career winners at the Cheltenham Festival, he gave a tip of his trilby and a wave to the crowd.But this was different. This was family."I don't know if I gave him a cheer, I was just speechless. I just broke down completely. I did for about 20 minutes after. I just couldn't help it, I just completely lost it," the 68-year-old told BBC Sport.Mullins, who plans to have runners at big meetings including Ayr and Sandown as he chases the trainers' title, said it was like being manager of a World Cup football team and your son getting the winning goal."It just doesn't get any better," he said.Broadway Boy heads home after Grand National fallPublished6 AprilGrand National 2025 result - where your horse finishedPublished5 AprilNick Rockett wins Grand National for Mullins duoPublished5 April'A million-to-one occurrence'Patrick, 35, is an amateur rider as a sideline to being his father's assistant at a training establishment in County Carlow that stands head and shoulders ahead of its jump racing rivals.Standing at 6ft 1in tall, Patrick's height and weight of about 11st 7lb limit the rides he can take, but the rocket that is Nick Rockett proved the ideal conveyance."To have one horse run in the National, but then to have one your son can ride is millions, millions, millions-to-one what happened today," said Willie."It is just something else to be able to leg up your son in the greatest race of all time. You dream of winning it yourself but to dream of putting your son up - when he was born I said he couldn't be the jockey the size of him, but he's turned out to be a fantastic jockey."Patrick is a student of the game, and the big race itself - devouring books on the history of this unique contest."I know the names of people who won the National nearly 200 years ago so to join that list is mind-blowing," he said, after winning the 177th running.The Jockey Club said both long-time leader Broadway Boy, a heavy faller on the second circuit, and Celebre D'Allen - who was pulled up - were walked on to horse ambulances after being assessed on course by vets and taken to the racecourse stables for further assessment.'I don't see him retiring'Willie Mullins was the first Irish trainer since the legendary Vincent O'Brien 70 years earlier to win the British championship in 2024.He is now poised to catch long-time leader Dan Skelton this time in the title race which concludes at the end of April.Having started the day £1m behind Skelton in prize money, he ate into that lead by £860,000 with the National result, and father and son even took the concluding race with Green Splendour.So what does Patrick put the stable's success down to?"It's my father's ambition. He's nearly 69 but he keeps wanting to get bigger and get better. I don't see him retiring, I just see him dying one day," he said.On top of the emotion of seeing his son triumph, Willie was thinking of old school friend Sadie, the late wife of owner Stewart Andrew, who died from cancer just days after watching Nick Rockett's first win in 2022.Andrew said: "Sadie's favourite colour was mustard and I always take that with me and I gave him a rub with it so it's worked, hasn't it?"Somewhere up there she will be having a glass of champagne and kicking her heels up, which is what she would want me to do."Related topicsHorse RacingMore on this story'Like a Disney movie' - relieve Grand National day'He amazes me' - Mullins seals historic 100th Cheltenham Festival winPublished13 March 2024Comments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 358Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9722 viewing9.7k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
