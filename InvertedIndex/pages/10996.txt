That's his life choices and nothing for me to get involved in," said Machado Garry."Saturday he's going to step into the octagon with someone who's a complete professional. I'm going to manhandle him and there's nothing he can do to stop me."Harrison backs UFC return for 'greatest of all time' NunesPublished4 days agoElliott to face Brahimaj at UFC Fight NightPublished4 days agoPrates, who has won his first four fights in the UFC, all by knockout, has said he would like to quit smoking entirely in the future, but has found it "hard".After his win over Neil Magny in November, Prates asked if he could smoke a cigarette in his post-fight news conference but said his request was denied as smoking was forbidden in the area.When asked by the media if he would share a cigarette with Prates after their contest on Saturday, Machado Garry, 27, suggested a different idea."I don't smoke so I won't. But I can sit down and talk about how I knocked him out and I can teach him how to get a little better," he said.The headlining fight was made between Machado Garry and Prates after Jamahal Hill withdrew injured from his bout with Khalil Rountree at the beginning of the month.It is the second fight in a row that Machado Garry has stepped in on short notice after replacing Belal Muhammad in December before a narrow defeat by Shavkat Rakhmonov."It speaks to the character and the person I am. I'm Dublin born and bred, they call us the fighting Irish for a reason," said Machado Garry. "When you call me and say "hey Ian, do you want to fight?" There's only one answer."Machado Garry - the statsMachado Garry's loss to Rakhmonov was the first of his 16-fight career and ended his impressive eight-fight win streak in the UFC.The Irishman is currently ranked seventh in the UFC welterweight rankings, with Prates six places below him in 13th.Of Machado Garry's eight wins since his UFC debut in 2021, three have come by knockout, meaning he has a 37.5% finish rate compared to Prates' 100%.The Irishman has said he prefers longer fights, however, where he can outclass and "dominate" his opponents over five rounds.Despite lacking the knockout power of Prates, Machado Garry still has some of the best striking statistics in the UFC's welterweight division.He is sixth on the list for significant strike accuracy at 55%, with title challenger Della Maddalena fifth with 55.2% and former champion Leon Edwards eighth with 54.2% in comparison.Machado Garry is also eighth on the list for striking differential at 1.9.The Irishman says a win over Prates should put him next in line for a title shot, with champion Muhammad and Jack Della Maddalena fighting for the belt at UFC 315 on 11 May.Related topicsMixed Martial ArtsMMA schedule and results 2025Published23 hours agoWatch every Born to Brawl episodePublished28 April 2024More MMA from the BBCNotifications, social media and more with BBC SportPublished31 JanuaryTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9760 viewing9.8k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
