Literally I get it's hard for PFL."They've put all the girls in the tournament. Now they have to find someone that's going to give me a good competition."Ditcheva has been told by the PFL she will likely fight at the end of the year against the tournament winner, having last fought in November."What if the champion doesn't end up coming out of the fight clean? What if they're injured?" Ditcheva said."Someone who has fought three times, do they want to fight me at the end of the year?"They might say, 'sorry, I'm injured, or I don't want to fight this year, I'll do it in January'. That's a whole year out for me. It's testing for sure, but something will come."Ditcheva is not the only PFL star to speak out about the scheduling, with several fighters demanding the securing of their release from the MMA promotion including Patricio Pitbull who subsequently signed for the UFC.Former Bellator middleweight champion Johnny Eblen posted on social media in February that he hadn't "heard a peep" about any fight.Briton Fabian Edwards, who lost to Eblen in his last outing in October, will fight in the first round of middleweight tournament on Friday and appealed to the PFL to get their best fighters booked."To see all those guys on the sidelines for a year or over a year, it's craziness. I just hope they can sort out what they need to sort out," Edwards said."I hope they fight all the guys soon. This is how we make our living. This is what we sacrifice everything for. Hopefully, they sort everything out."This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch Ditcheva stop Santos to win MMA world titleRelated topicsMixed Martial ArtsMMA schedule and results 2025Published23 hours agoWatch every Born to Brawl episodePublished28 April 2024More MMA from the BBCNotifications, social media and more with BBC SportPublished31 JanuaryTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9760 viewing9.8k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
