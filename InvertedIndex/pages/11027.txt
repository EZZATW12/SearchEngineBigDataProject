Alexander Volkanovski and Diego Lopes will meet for the title itself - which is being vacated by Ilia Topuria - at UFC 314 in Miami on 12 April.A comprehensive win will certainly raise Murphy's claim for a shot, but he is arguably in the pecking order behind Russia's Movsar Evloev, who is on an eight-fight UFC win streak at featherweight.Despite this, Murphy's seven victories is the second-longest winning run in the division. His streak matches the best runs set by Topuria, former title holder Conor McGregor and UFC legend Jose Aldo.His form hasn't gone unnoticed by his employers either, with Murphy confirming this week he has signed a new six-fight deal with the UFC.Murphy's success in the promotion has largely stemmed from his high-level striking.He has consistently out-struck opponents, with his standout performance being against UFC veteran Edson Barboza last year.The Briton landed 220 significant strikes in the bout, which is the fourth-most in UFC history in a single contest.Only Max Holloway has landed more, with the American landing a remarkable 445 against Calvin Kattar in 2021, 290 versus Brian Ortega in 2018 and 230 during his bout with Yair Rodriguez in 2021.Murphy also:Holds the fourth-highest striking differential in UFC featherweight history at 2.13Is ninth on the featherweight list for significant strike accuracy at 54.1%Has the fifth-highest takedown accuracy in UFC featherweight history at 54.2%Although Murphy shines technically, critics have pointed to his lack of finishes as being a reason for his achievements "going under the radar".Murphy points to the calibre of opponents he's faced, such as Dan Ige, who he beat in October."I know people want to see finishes. I never come into fights thinking 'I'm just gonna have a boring fight and get a decision'," said Murphy."But you've got to look at the guys I've been in there with, they're hard to finish. Dan Ige has never been finished."Emmett made his UFC debut in 2016 and has won 10 of his 14 fights in the promotion.His strengths lie in his power, with the American boasting 12 knockdowns - the most in UFC featherweight history.He is also joint-second on the list for knockdown average per 15 minutes, alongside Teruto Ishihara, with the pair's 1.32 second only to McGregor's 2.31.His last fight was against Bryce Mitchell in December 2023, where a huge overhand right went viral as one of the highlight reel knockouts of the year.Murphy says he is expecting "the biggest challenge" of his career so far."It's a massive challenge but I'm ready for that. I've trained hard for it and the outcome will be the outcome," he said."I asked for this fight because Josh Emmett is a warrior and he will bring the best out of me."Related topicsMixed Martial ArtsMMA schedule and results 2025Published23 hours agoWatch every Born to Brawl episodePublished28 April 2024More MMA from the BBCNotifications, social media and more with BBC SportPublished31 JanuaryTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8885 viewing8.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
