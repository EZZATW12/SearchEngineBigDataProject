This promotion has given me everything and it deserves that back and I can't give it any more," said McCann."I came, I saw, I didn't conquer and get the belt. My time is done now."The Brits that are left in - it's your time now, girls. Do more than I could. I knocked on the door and opened it."Rosi Sexton was the first British female to fight in the UFC in 2013, and McCann made her debut five years later.McCann, who is a former flyweight champion in UK-based promotion Cage Warriors, won seven of her 14 bouts in the UFC, with her highlights including two spinning elbow knockouts in 2022. She leaves the sport having won six of her bouts by knockout and claiming three performance-of-the-night bonuses, the most in UFC flyweight history.McCann said she wanted to retire at home with her friends and family in attendance."The camps are too hard and, to keep it all together, it's too hard to not get the wins and take the damage," she said.Her retirement comes after four defeats in her past five fights."UFC and Dana (UFC president Dana White), I started this sport at 24 and I have given you all my heart and soul," said McCann."Tonight, with that performance on a week's notice, it's not good enough. The UFC deserves more."From a little girl from Norris Green fighting in arenas - look at me, look at what I've managed to do."This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, 'MMA gave me the courage to be who I am''Don't take no for an answer'McCann showed typical focus and intensity during her walkout at the O2 Arena, while Brazil's Thainara enthusiastically jived her way to the octagon.The pair traded lefts and rights in the early stages before Thainara secured the first takedown of the contest - a move which proved to be the defining moment.The crowd attempted to rouse McCann with a succession of "Molly" chants, but it was in vain as Thainara outworked her on the floor before securing a rear naked choke.An emotional McCann took off her gloves - a gesture which usually signals retirement - as stablemate Paddy Pimblett looked on with tears in his eyes at octagon-side.McCann has always worn her emotions on her sleeve, endearing her to a legion of fans even in defeat.McCann retires as one of the biggest MMA stars the UK has produced.She suffered several heart-wrenching defeats, including her UFC debut in her home town of Liverpool, but said she never let anyone "tear her down"."Don't take no for an answer," said McCann when asked by the UFC about the advice she would give to young female fighters."Have that blind faith in yourself. No-one's opinions can deter you from what your goal is."The only thing that separates you from your goal is how much you're willing to chase it. Thank you for it all."Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, McCann was never stopped in her career, with all her defeats coming via submission or pointsImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, McCann immediately took her gloves off after the loss Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, McCann lost on her UFC debut in 2018 but went on to become one of the company's most recognisable British starsImage source, PA MediaImage caption, Paddy Pimblett, long-time friend and training partner of McCann, was emotional at cagesideImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, McCann retires as possibly the greatest female fighter ever from the UKRelated topicsMixed Martial ArtsMore on this storyMcCann's rollercoaster UFC career in picturesPublished23 MarchBrady upsets Edwards with dominant displayPublished22 MarchComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 129Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8899 viewing8.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
