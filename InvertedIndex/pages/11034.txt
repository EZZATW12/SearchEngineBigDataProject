"It was a great adventure to survive without a phone and without money, finding a place to sleep and asking people for help - it was an amazing experience," he said."One time we found a place to sleep after 10 minutes of looking, another day you asked people for help but they said 'no', and it can take four to five hours to find a place."Normally you don't spend your holidays like this. After three days people would say 'enough, I will go to a hotel now'. I survived a whole month - we won this show, me and my friend."I owe the UK fans after last performance - EdwardsPublished19 MarchUFC London - all you need to knowPublished22 MarchMeet the next great British MMA heavyweight hope Published16 MarchOn Saturday at UFC London at O2 Arena, the 42-year-old will return for the first time since a split-decision defeat at the hands of Alex Pereira in 2023 when he takes on New Zealand's Carlos Ulberg in the co-main event.Blachowicz, who won his only UFC title in 2020 before making one successful defence, says the experience in Asia felt like a "detox"."It's weird and funny because a lot of adventures happen, but I am happy I have a shower at my home, a warm place and food in the fridge," he added. "Now I appreciate the simple things more - I don't need a fancy car. I appreciate a shower because some people didn't have a shower, it was a home with nothing and you sleep on the floor. "A lot of the places were very poor, so I appreciate the simple things."Blachowicz experienced some difficult moments during his rehabilitation following double shoulder surgery and "felt worse three months after surgery than he did before"."You're not 20 years old any more - you just have to wait a little longer and it will be good," the doctors advised him.Eventually, he started to feel better, before taking his place on the reality show.The difficulties Blachowicz faced in recovery during the twilight of his career would have forced many athletes into retirement, but he has a simple reason for fighting on."Because I want to. I miss the feelings that happen in fight week, the emotions," he added."I like fighting. I don't have to do it, I can stop right now because I have a lot of things I could do. But I want to do it - I love to do it."Related topicsMixed Martial ArtsMMA schedule and results 2025Published23 hours agoWatch every Born to Brawl episodePublished28 April 2024More MMA from the BBCNotifications, social media and more with BBC SportPublished31 JanuaryTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8899 viewing8.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
