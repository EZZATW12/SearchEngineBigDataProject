McLaren have set themselves the target of winning the triple crown again.They are reigning F1 world champions, and McLaren drivers Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris are first and second in this year's championship after the first five grands prix.IndyCar provides an additional presence in the US market beyond the country's three grands prix in Miami, Austin and Las Vegas, as well as an entry in the Indy 500, the country's biggest race.McLaren drivers Christian Lundgaard and Pato O'Ward are third and sixth in this year's IndyCar series after three rounds.World Endurance gives McLaren access to the prestige of Le Mans, as well as a direct marketing link to the company's road-going, high-performance sports cars. Many of McLaren's road-car market rivals, such as Ferrari, Porsche and Lamborghini, are also competing in WEC.McLaren also have a presence in the Formula 1 Academy for aspiring female drivers.Formula E is a world championship but it is struggling to maintain a significant public profile and last year Brown said its failure to grow its audience was the series' "biggest problem". In addition to that, while Formula E gives brands a chance to trumpet sustainability as a message, the same now applies to F1.F1 already uses highly efficient hybrid engines, and from next year the electrical part of the power unit will increase to supply about 50% of the total performance. F1 is also switching to fully sustainable fuels.McLaren is also pushing its sustainability agenda in other areas, for example by producing a circularity handbook, external which was commissioned by governing body the FIA aimed at improving sustainability practices in F1 design and manufacturing. Brown said McLaren would look for a new owner for the Formula E team, whose British drivers Taylor Barnard and Sam Bird are fourth and 13th in the championship after the first five rounds."For now, we are focused on setting this great team up for future success by working towards securing a new owner," Brown said."The team has delivered a strong start to the year and we intend to finish the season on a high."Related topicsMotorsportFormula 1Comments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 65Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8860 viewing8.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
