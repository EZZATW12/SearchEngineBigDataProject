He lost 29 minutes on Saturday's opening run after breaking a steering arm on his Ford M-Sport Puma. However, McErlean and co-driver Eoin Treacy went on to deliver their best performance in a Rally1 car with the second-best time on stage 15.They placed 10th in Kenya and picked up two Super Sunday points but drop to 12th spot overall.Round four of the 14 race calendar is the Rally Islas Canarias from 24-27 April.Safari Rally Kenya result1.
