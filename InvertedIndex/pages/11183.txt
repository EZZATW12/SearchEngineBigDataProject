They exposed our weaknesses a bit but we probably needed it, because we've not had a close game yet."London Pulse head coach Sam Bird: "It was a messy game. I was pleased with the resilience, it's obviously a difficult injury and I hope Gabby is OK, but to have that break and keep your discipline with six players on the court, they managed that really well."Birmingham Panthers head coach Jo Trip: "We were really calm and controlled for 75-80% of that game. A really pleasing effort and definitely something we're growing from."Best of the statsThunder goal attack Elmere van der Berg was top scorer in the NSL after Saturday, taking her total for the season to 194.After registering 10 rebounds in the defeat by Thunder, Rhinos goal shooter Joyce Mvula now leads the league with 18.Dragons put up their best score of the season in defeat and also had their best shooting success so far (88%).Fixtures and resultsRound sixFriday, 18 AprilLondon Pulse v Manchester Thunder (19:00 BST) - live on BBC iPlayer, BBC Sport website & app, and on demandSaturday, 19 AprilLondon Mavericks v Loughborough Lightning (17:00)Birmingham Panthers v Nottingham Forest (18:00)Cardiff Dragons v Leeds Rhinos (19:00)Related topicsNetballTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8877 viewing8.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
