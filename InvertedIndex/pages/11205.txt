"It is really exciting. It completely changes the game for a third of the game essentially."Metcalf, 32, announced her pregnancy in November and will sit out the on-court action this season but plans to return to playing for Manchester Thunder.She will be closely watching the two-point innovation and said: "When the super shot comes into the mix and you hear that horn go, it's not just about changing up structures, it's your mentality."When does the Netball Super League start and how can I watch?The relaunched NSL season begins on Friday, 14 March 2025.One match from each round will be shown live on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app, beginning with London Pulse v Nottingham Forest on Sunday, 16 March at 17:00 GMT.Fans will also be able to catch up on those matches on BBC iPlayer.The other three matches in each round will be available to watch on Sky Sports.Netball Super League fixtures - see when your team are playingWho are the 2025 Netball Super League teams?This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Netball Super League players pitch their teamsEight teams will compete in the 2025 Netball Super League:Manchester ThunderLoughborough LightningLondon PulseLeeds RhinosLondon MavericksCardiff DragonsBirmingham PanthersNottingham ForestThe league has been reduced from 10 to eight teams and squads trimmed from 15 to 10 players to ensure a more even distribution of talent.Team Bath, Severn Stars, Strathclyde Sirens and Surrey Storm were not selected to be part of the league, while Forest and Panthers are new additions.The eight clubs were selected after an open tender process which started in October 2023.Teams have committed to delivering certain standards, including an increase in player salaries and the ability to each host at least two games per season in a large arena.Clubs were given an opportunity to bring in players during the signing window, which took place between Monday, 1 July and Friday, 23 August 2024.The final squads were revealed on September 4 2024.'We want to create our own legacy' - Forest set for Netball Super League debutPublished7 MarchWhat happened at the Netball Super Cup?The inaugural Netball Super Cup - a one-day competition to tee up the new season - took place on Saturday, 8 March at Sheffield's Utilita Arena with all eight teams taking part.London Pulse beat Leeds Rhinos 20-15 in the final to lift the trophy.Each match lasted 14 minutes, rather than the usual 60, and it was a first opportunity to see the eight refreshed teams with the super shot.Teams were split into groups of four and Manchester Thunder and Leeds Rhinos topped those standings.Rhinos then beat Nottingham Forest in their semi-final while Thunder were pipped by Pulse.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, London Pulse won the inaugural Netball Super CupHow professional is netball - and what are the players earning?The NSL launched in 2005 and 20 years later we are seeing a major push towards professionalisation.Super League managing director Claire Nelson says the average player salary has increased by 60% for 2025, with the base salary doubled."We are at the start of a journey," Nelson told BBC Sport. "The quicker we grow the sport, the more we can reinvest into our people."We need more eyeballs on the screens and full arenas. I want to see tens of thousands of fans filling arenas and having a great time so people can see netball's full potential."The reality is many players are still working or studying alongside their netball careers.Manchester Thunder head coach Karen Greig told BBC Sport it is going to take "a long time to actually be professional".Salary structures may differ from club to club. Greig explained that nine of the 10 players in her squad are covered by a salary cap, while the 10th sits outside of those regulations as the marquee player and is paid a minimum of £20,000 for the season.Six of the other nine are paid £14,000-£19,999, said Greig, while the final three are paid £10,000-£13,999.The league expects full professionalisation will take around 10 years.Another addition for 2025 is the NXT Gen league. This is an under-23 feeder league where players who missed out on NSL contracts may be eligible to play.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Nottingham Forest's stars join local kids for a kickaboutRelated topicsNetballMore on this storyLightning beat Thunder to win second title in a rowPublished29 June 2024How can netball cash in on its grassroots support?Published8 MarchNewton 'honoured' to captain Cardiff Dragons in NSL Published22 JanuaryTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8866 viewing8.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
