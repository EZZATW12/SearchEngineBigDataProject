It will be interesting."Cricket's only previous appearance at the Olympics was at Paris 1900.On that occasion, Great Britain won by 158 runs against France in a one-off final, after the Netherlands and Belgium withdrew.The BOA said in August it hopes to enter a men's football team into the 2028 Games, uniting the England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland Football Associations to field a first Team GB men's Olympic side since London 2012.England were the nominated nation to attempt to qualify on behalf of Team GB for the women's football competition at the Paris 2024 Games, but they fell short in their Nations League campaign.Image source, Getty ImagesRelated topicsCricketMore on this storyGet cricket news sent straight to your phonePublished31 JanuaryTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8966 viewing9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
