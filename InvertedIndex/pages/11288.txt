We can look forward to a great boxing tournament," outgoing IOC president Thomas Bach said.Boxing has featured at every Olympics since 1904, except 1912, but the IOC has run the sport at the past two Games after the International Boxing Association (IBA) was suspended in 2019 over governance, finance, refereeing and ethical issues.The Russian-led IBA was then stripped of its status in June 2023 over a failure to implement reforms.The IOC and the IBA clashed during last year's Olympics in Paris over the participation of two boxers, Algeria's Imane Khelif and Taiwan's Lin Yu-ting.The IBA banned the fighters during the 2023 World Championships saying they had failed gender eligibility tests, but the IOC allowed them to compete and both won gold medals in their weight classes.World Boxing was formed in April 2023 and now has 84 members across five continents, including Great Britain."This is a great day for boxers, boxing and everyone connected with our sport at every level across the world," said World Boxing president Boris van der Vorst."World Boxing understands that being part of the Olympic Games is a privilege and not a right and we are determined to be a trustworthy and reliable partner that will adhere to and uphold the values of the Olympic Movement."The IOC has said only athletes whose national federations are members of World Boxing by the time of the start of the qualification events for the 2028 Olympics can take part in Los Angeles.The dates for the qualifying period are yet to be confirmed.Related topicsOlympic GamesBoxingTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8931 viewing8.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
