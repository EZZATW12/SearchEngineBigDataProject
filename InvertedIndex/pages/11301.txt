The IOC added World Boxing has met several key criteria to merit provisional recognition, including gaining sufficient members across five continents.It has also applied the sports integrity process during Paris 2024, providing independent oversight and good governance structures, as well as assurances on revenues and signing up to the World Anti-Doping Code.IOC decision to strip IBA recognition 'justified'Published3 April 2024IBA asks Trump to 'look into' 2028 Olympics omissionPublished22 January'Important milestone but still work to do'Boris van der Vorst, president of World Boxing, said: "Keeping its place at the Olympic Games is absolutely critical to the future of our sport at every level, from the grassroots to the highest echelons of professional boxing, and this decision by the IOC takes us one step closer to our objective of seeing boxing restored to the Olympic programme."[It] is an important milestone, however, everyone connected with World Boxing understands that being part of the Olympic movement is a privilege and a responsibility and not a right."There is still a lot of work to do, and everyone is as committed as ever to continuing to work together and doing everything within our power to deliver a better future for our sport and ensuring that boxing remains at heart of the Olympic movement."Apart from removing its status, the IOC was also at loggerheads with the IBA during Paris 2024 over the participation of two boxers, Algeria's Imane Khelif and Taiwan's Lin Yu-ting.The IBA banned the fighters midway through the 2023 World Championships saying they had failed gender eligibility tests, but the IOC allowed them to compete and both won gold medals in their weight classes.Boxing schedule and results 2025Published1 day agoWatch every Born to Brawl episodePublished28 April 2024Bach to step down as IOC memberThe IOC has also agreed to accept the resignation of president Thomas Bach as an IOC member.The German announced at the IOC session in Paris in August that he would not seek a third term,  in line with a regulation he helped draft that limits a president to a maximum of 12 years in office.Bach was elected as the ninth IOC president in September 2013 and then re-elected for a four-year term in March 2021.His resignation will be effective after 23 June, when he will hand over to the new president, with seven candidates vying to be elected as Bach's successor in Greece on 20 March.The 71-year-old won fencing team gold in 1976 and joined the IOC as a member in 1991, before moving up to the executive board in 1996.Related topicsOlympic GamesBoxingMore boxing from the BBCCoe and six rivals pitch to be new IOC presidentPublished30 JanuaryNotifications, social media and more with BBC SportPublished31 JanuaryTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8967 viewing9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
