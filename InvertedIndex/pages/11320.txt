I really felt the energy and was turning it into positivity. It was amazing to be a part of."GB's Bryson and French into modern pentathlon finalpublished at 11:07 10 August 202411:07 10 August 2024Image source, ReutersGreat Britain's Kerenza Bryson and Kate French have made it through to Sunday's modern pentathlon final.Bryson finished as the top qualifier in her semi-final with 1402 points, one above Italy's Elena Micheli and Alice Sotero.French, who won gold in Tokyo three years ago and took a break from the sport in 2023, was three points further back in fifth.The current European champion, Bryson got off to a perfect start with a clear run in the show jumping with a maximum 300 points.The British pair were the top two in the fencing bonus round, while Bryson was first across the finish line in the laser run.The final gets under way at 10:00 BST on Sunday, the final day of the Paris Olympics.'I felt a lot of pressure' - Choongpublished at 15:42 8 August 202415:42 8 August 2024Image source, Getty ImagesGreat Britain's Joe Choong says he is "sorry" after a disappointing start to the defence of his Olympics modern pentathlon title.The 29-year-old won gold in Tokyo and there were hopes he could repeat that feat again in Paris.But he now looks to be out of contention after finishing 29th out of 36 in the fencing ranking round."I’m really disappointed with that. I came here with high hopes," Choong told BBC Sport."I've had a tough year with some injuries but thought I was in good physical condition, but I really struggled out there."The top three positions are occupied by Ukraine's Oleksandr Tovkai, Egypt's Ahmed Elgendy and Pavels Svecovs of Latvia.Choong has previously spoken of his disappointment in girlfriend, and fellow pentathlete, Olivia Green not being selected for the Games and feels this has had an impact on his performance."I think one of the problems is there's not been any clarity on that decision-making process. We've not been able to have any sort of reasonable explanation," he added."It's really hard to compete well, especially when things start to go badly, and you'’re not generally happy with the set-up."I'm just so gutted. I felt a lot of pressure to do it for Liv, for myself, it's felt like a bit of an uphill battle and I'm just really disappointed."I'm so sorry for everyone back home - I really hoped I could go and win another medal. I definitely have it in me, but I've just not done it today."15:01 24 July 2024Modern pentathlon at the Paris 2024 Olympics, published at 15:01 24 July 2024Modern pentathlon at the Paris 2024 OlympicsAttributionOlympic Games06:01 1 July 2024Pentathlete returning to Olympics after year off, published at 06:01 1 July 2024Pentathlete returning to Olympics after year offAttributionEngland13:30 26 June 2024Choong to chase gold before change 'no-one wanted', published at 13:30 26 June 2024Choong to chase gold before change 'no-one wanted'AttributionOlympic Games21:48 12 May 2024GB's Varley celebrates World Cup silver after 'rocky years', published at 21:48 12 May 2024GB's Varley celebrates World Cup silver after 'rocky years'AttributionModern Pentathlon21:25 20 April 2024GB's Bryson wins World Cup gold in Ankara, published at 21:25 20 April 2024GB's Bryson wins World Cup gold in AnkaraAttributionModern pentathlon13:54 19 December 2023Brothers may face each other for different nations, published at 13:54 19 December 2023Brothers may face each other for different nationsAttributionModern pentathlon21:25 27 August 2023Choong retains men's pentathlon world title, published at 21:25 27 August 2023Choong retains men's pentathlon world titleAttributionModern pentathlon09:14 25 August 2023Pentathlon change leaves Choong uncertain of future, published at 09:14 25 August 2023Pentathlon change leaves Choong uncertain of futureAttributionModern pentathlon00:17 23 August 2023Modern Pentathlon World Championships: BBC coverage, published at 00:17 23 August 2023Modern Pentathlon World Championships: BBC coverageAttributionModern pentathlon21:52 1 July 2023Pentathlon gold for GB team at European Games, published at 21:52 1 July 2023Pentathlon gold for GB team at European Games22:39 29 June 2023Curry and Varley win bronze in European Games, published at 22:39 29 June 2023Curry and Varley win bronze in European Games12:07 20 June 2023What are the European Games and who is in GB's squad?, published at 12:07 20 June 2023What are the European Games and who is in GB's squad?AttributionOlympics12:31 19 June 2023Choong brothers aim for Paris Olympics together, published at 12:31 19 June 2023Choong brothers aim for Paris Olympics togetherAttributionModern pentathlon12:30 19 June 2023Choong brothers target Paris Olympics together.
