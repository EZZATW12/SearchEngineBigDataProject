I understand the responsibility that comes with my position in the sport, and I will forever aim to do better. "This has undoubtedly been one of the darkest and most difficult periods of my life, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has supported me during this time."Dujardin's six Olympic medals, comprising three gold, a silver and two bronze, are the joint most of any British female Olympian, alongside former track cyclist Dame Laura Kenny's five golds and a silver.Dujardin was provisionally suspended on 23 July for "engaging in conduct contrary to the principles of horse welfare", one day after the FEI received a video showing her excessively whipping a horse during a training session at a private stable.The FEI said the footage of the training session did not constitute any other rule violations and added that there have not been any further complaints raised against Dujardin's conduct since the video emerged."These significant sanctions send a clear message that anyone, regardless of their profile, who engages in conduct that compromises the welfare of the horse will face serious consequences," FEI secretary general Sabrina Ibanez said."We believe this outcome reaffirms the FEI's commitment to equine welfare and to its role as guardian of our equine partners."Ibanez added it was "regrettable" the case had put the sport in the news for "all the wrong reasons" leading up to the Paris Games but said the FEI had acted decisively  by starting an investigation and imposing a provisional suspension on the video emerging.Dujardin withdrew from the Paris 2024 Olympics, where she was due to represent Team GB, after admitting she was the person in the video.UK Sport says Dujardin is "ineligible to receive public funding and publicly funded benefits" while she serves her suspension and any future funding beyond the FEI sanction "will be reviewed".Chief executive of British Equestrian, Jim Eyre, said the welfare and ethical treatment of horses "has always been a priority"."We will continue to work with our member bodies tirelessly to uphold the integrity of our sports through enforcement, education, and advancement in our knowledge," he added.And British Dressage said it is "united with the FEI in taking a zero-tolerance approach" regarding mistreatment of horses."We launched the charter for the horse last year and remain totally committed to upholding these standards," chief executive Jason Brautigam said.  "Working closely with our colleagues across the federation, we will continue to collectively put the health, care and wellbeing of the horse at the heart of everything we do, and proactively demonstrate that equestrian sport is conducted in an ethical and responsible way."Ban is a 'good message for the whole dressage world'This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, The FEI was made aware of the incident after receiving a video from Dutch lawyer Stephan Wensing, who was representing an anonymous complainant."My client is very happy that the FEI has taken this so seriously and this is a good message for the whole dressage world," Wensing said."She is also happy that Charlotte Dujardin has taken this seriously, and has taken responsibility and accepted her punishment."The FEI tribunal stated that the video showed Dujardin whipping the horse more than 20 times, mostly from behind on the hind legs, also in-between and from the front on the front legs and shoulders of the horse.Who is Charlotte Dujardin?Dujardin shot to prominence at the London 2012 Games on Valegro, winning gold medals in the team and individual disciplines, to a soundtrack that included Land of Hope and Glory.The pair picked up individual gold and team silver four years later in Rio.On a different horse, Gio, she won two bronze medals at the Covid-19-delayed Tokyo 2020 Games.Dujardin was due to compete in both the individual dressage and team event at Paris 2024, alongside Carl Hester and world champion Lottie Fry, on new horse Imhotep.She required a medal of any colour to take the outright lead as the most-decorated British female Olympian from now-retired cyclist Kenny.Dressage is the oldest equestrian discipline, and sees rider and horse perform a series of movements to music across the gaits of walk, trot and canter.Related topicsEquestrianTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9798 viewing9.8k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
