Losing is the concern and how you play."If you start giving that (Hull's winless run) air, then you start thinking about it. For me, it's a great stadium to play at, we've just got to find out groove."We've played Wigan twice here, KR twice here – two standouts in the competition and just unfortunate that we've had them so early in the season."I do see brighter times. For us, the honeymoon is probably over, but on the back of last season we've had a pretty good start. This middle nine to 10 weeks, that's where you find out where you're at."Wigan Warriors head coach Matt Peet:"I'm proud of the lads, no doubt. The stuff we did defensively - we were very connected."The intelligence of our defending against some very good attacking shape (was great).[On the length of time taken to award Abbas Miski's try] "It's just all ugly at the moment, isn't it?"You put the TV on to watch a game, I don't know who can make these changes, but we've got to make it more fun to watch this sport."Hull FC: Pryce; Barron, Briscoe, Litten, Martin; Cust, Sezer; Ese'ese, Bourouh, Knight, Hardaker, Ashworth, Asiata.Interchanges: Chamberlain, Aydin, Balmforth, Laidlaw.Wigan: Field; Miski, Keighran, Wardle, Marshall; French, Smith; Byrne, O'Neill, Walters, Nsemba, Farrell, Ellis.Interchanges: Thompson, Leeming, Hill, Eckersley.Referee: Jack Smith.Related topicsHull FCRugby LeagueWigan WarriorsComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 144Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9900 viewing9.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
