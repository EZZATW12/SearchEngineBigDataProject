Following a turnover, Simm dived over in the right corner expertly to restore the visitors' lead.Midway through the first half, the visitors put their grip firmly on the match as another high kick towards the left corner from Milnes on the final tackle exposed more weak Giants defending, and Mellor gathered to score his first Super League try of the season after barging over Gagai to touch down.Wood had a try disallowed for the visitors after it was deemed he was just short of the line, and moments later Joe Westerman was sin-binned for a high shot as ill-discipline started to creep into Castleford's dominant first-half showing.However, while down to 12 men, the visitors extended their lead with a penalty from Milnes.Six minutes into the second half, the Tigers got their fourth try of the day when Senior collected a good pass over the top of the Giants defence from Daejarn Asi to dive over in the corner for his second.Good work on the hour mark from Castleford's Tex Hoy then set up Milnes, who dived over under the posts to mark his 100th career appearance with a try his performance merited.Giants prop Wilson reduced the arrears when he barged through Hoy to stretch over and grab a consolation score, but it was far too little, too late as the hosts went down to a ninth consecutive league defeat of the season.Huddersfield boss Luke Robinson said: "That's probably one of the most disappointing ones of the year to be honest."We started to come alive when the game was gone."We started drowning them defensively, running with a bit more vigour in attack."That's really disappointing from my perspective. It means when the heat is on, we wilt a little bit."Castleford boss Danny McGuire said:"I'm really pleased. I just said to the players that's reward for their effort, commitment and the things we've been doing these last few weeks."We needed to keep believing. We didn't quite get what we deserved last week at Wakefield, but it gave us momentum and confidence, and it was a really good team performance across the board."We know where we are, but we want to compete, challenge. Anyone can beat anyone at the moment. There are some interesting results flying about."There's a few teams probably separating themselves from the others, but I'd like to think we could ruffle a few feathers over these next few weeks."Huddersfield: Gagai; Carr, Halsall, Jake Bibby, Swift; Flanagan, Rush; Wilson, Golding, Burgess, Hewitt, Greenwood, Cudjoe.Interchanges: Woolford, English, Jack Bibby, Milne.Castleford: Hoy; Simm, Cini, Wood, I Senior; Asi, Milnes; Amone, Rimbu, Dezaria, Simbiken, Mellor, Lawler.Interchanges: Westerman, Okoro, Singleton, Salabio.Sin-bin: Westerman (33).Referee: Marcus Griffiths.Related topicsCastleford TigersRugby LeagueHuddersfield GiantsComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 48Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9900 viewing9.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
