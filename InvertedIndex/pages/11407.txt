With an hour gone, 14-6 down and Sue sent off, Rovers' second defeat of the season felt inevitable, but they rallied remarkably to move four points clear at the top with an eighth win of the campaign.Despite an excellent performance, Leeds fell to their sixth straight defeat to the Robins and stay sixth in the table.It was a superb game but will generate more conversation about officiating after two reds and one yellow card.Early in the game, Leeds' Jack Sinfield was sin-binned for making contact to the head of Oliver Gildart, and while Jake Connor was also off the field for medical treatment, Rovers struck against 11 men through Broadbent after Peta Hiku's break.But Handley got on the end of Connor's grubber to score in the left corner and the teams exchanged penalties to leave the game 6-6 at half-time.Image source, SWpix.comImage caption, Hull KR's Jack Broadbent scores his second try against Leeds RhinosLeeds began the second half brighter and Connor's tip-on pass freed Handley down the left and he twice exchanged passes with Lumb to send the winger into the corner for a superb try.Then came the first of the red cards as Sue made direct contact to the head of Sam Lisone with his shoulder. Even though Lisone was dropping his height from the initial tackle, the referee saw no mitigation because Sue did not attempt to wrap his arm.Lachlan Miller kicked the resulting penalty from 35 metres to move Leeds further in front.But Jai Whitbread's break led to Broadbent's second try to bring the score back to 14-10, before the Rhinos were also reduced to 12 men with eight minutes remaining for Handley's high tackle, also having not attempted to wrap his arm.The penalty gave Rovers field position and they worked the play from left to right to send Batchelor, a back rower installed as a makeshift wing, into the right corner.And with four minutes left, Lewis spotted space on the short side, floated a pass wide to free Broadbent up the left wing and his return ball sent Lewis in for a dramatic winning try.Leeds head coach Brad Arthur told BBC Radio Leeds:"I'm extremely proud of that performance and the resilience and how we got ourselves into a good strong position."But we need to learn how we close games out. We did it against Warrington as well."We're just not quite at that level yet, and that's the bit we need to be a real threat in the competition."Hull KR head coach Willie Peters told BBC Radio Humberside:"We knew Leeds were going to be a tough, physical team and they dominated a lot of that game."When we went down to 12 men we found a way to connect because our attack was off for large parts of that game."I know the fight that's in our team but I did think, 'How are we going to get those points?' But we kept playing and came up with a big play at the end."Leeds: Miller, Hall, Newman, Handley, Lumb, Connor, Sinfield, Jenkins, O'Connor, Oledzki, McDonnell, Gannon, Palasia.Interchanges: Holroyd, Lisone, Bentley, Watkins.Sin-bin: Sinfield (5).Sent off: Handley (72).Hull KR: Mourgue, Hiku, Batchelor, Gildart, Broadbent, Lewis, May, Sue, Litten, Waerea-Hargreaves, Hadley, Tanginoa, Minchella.Interchanges: Luckley, Whitbread, Brown, Leyland.Sent off: Sue (58).Referee: Chris Kendall.Related topicsLeeds RhinosHull Kingston RoversRugby LeagueComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 232Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9946 viewing9.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
