I can't wait," he said."I've been a fan growing up, a season-ticket holder when I was a young lad, and now being coached by Paul Wellens, who I used to watch when he played at Knowsley Road. I think you have to pinch yourself sometimes."Cross has featured in seven games for Salford in all competitions this season, with his most recent coming against Catalans in the Challenge Cup on 4 April."Deon is a great addition to come into our squad and a player I've admired for some time," said head coach Wellens."It's a great story, similar to Matt Whitley, as he was a young lad in our system as a junior, and it didn't quite work out for him. Now, he's come full circle, and I know how much it means to him to represent this club."Related topicsRugby LeagueSt HelensTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9946 viewing9.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
