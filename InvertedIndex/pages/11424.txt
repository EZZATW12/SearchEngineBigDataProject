"It was 79 minutes and 10 seconds, he got the ball down the right-hand side and he's re-injured his hamstring."He's going to need surgery to repair that, and we're thinking the best-case scenario is three-to-four-months. I'm not a specialist, but that's what we're being told."It's a big blow for us, but a bigger blow for Jase. He's already worked really hard to get back, and he's been really unfortunate."Qareqare has 22 tries in 40 games for Tigers since making his debut in June 2021.Related topicsCastleford TigersRugby LeagueTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9939 viewing9.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
