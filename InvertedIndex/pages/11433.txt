I think that's why you see people exploring opportunities outside the Premiership."'I would have liked to have seen the game progress'Since making his debut in 2011, Wade has had a varied playing career which saw him spend eight years with Wasps while he also spent time with French side Racing 92 after his NFL journey came to an end and before his Premiership return."I don't think there's too much of a difference, which I don't know is a good or a bad thing. Because being away [from the Premiership] for seven years, you would like to see the game progress on a bit more," he said."It seems as though there are fewer international stars for one. When I was at Wasps, we had a lot of people from different parts of the world."A lot of young guys were coming through and as you can see now, they're spread around the league. But it's a good thing as well to see some homegrown talent and rugby being played."I would have liked to have seen the game progress a lot more in the span of almost a decade."Gloucester's Wade to join Wigan in cross-code switchPublished18 AprilField and Miski give Wigan derby win over SaintsPublished18 AprilWade returned to England last summer when he joined Gloucester, where he has scored seven tries in 10 Premiership matches this term.That includes two hat-tricks, taking his try-scoring tally to 89, fourth on the league's all-time list.Despite his prolific try-scoring record Wade is yet to win any major honours during his career, but he could still bow out at Gloucester with silverware, with his side still in play-off contention this term.Should Gloucester miss out, however, Wade could be in the frame to win his first trophy in a different sport as he joins a Wigan side who broke records in 2024 to win a historic quadruple of every domestic trophy on offer and are in the frame to retain their league title this term.Asked about how it would feel to potentially win a Super League Grand Final with Wigan, Wade added: "It would be crazy, but time will tell what the future holds."For now, I'll focus on these last four games with Gloucester. We're still in with a chance of making the play-offs even after last weekend's result. Once I've finished here then I'll be onto Wigan to see how I can develop and help the team up there."Related topicsGloucesterRugby UnionRugby LeagueWigan WarriorsTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9939 viewing9.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
