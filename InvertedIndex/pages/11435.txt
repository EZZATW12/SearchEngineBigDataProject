Gannon's father, Jim, played in Super League for three different clubs but is from Australia and the Leeds player wants to follow in his dad's footsteps."This is a great opportunity for me and one I had to take," said Gannon. "I have spent time in Australia with my dad's family and I know how big the game is over there."Related topicsLeeds RhinosRugby LeagueTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9117 viewing9.1k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
