"Working with Peter [Ebdon] has refocused me on everything else."Champions do not think like everyone else. For a while I started thinking like everyone else and saw myself as a bit of a draw-filler in major events. Now I've had a complete 180, now I believe again and that makes me dangerous."I've come here this year with my game in the best shape it has been in and if I get my chances I could be a handful for anybody."Trump wins after illness and injury hampered preparationImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Judd Trump won the world title in 2019Trump started the day 6-3 ahead of Chinese qualifier Zhou Yuelong, but the world number one was in stunning form on Wednesday with four centuries in five frames - 113, 114, 114 and 100 - to win 10-4.That takes Trump's season total to 98 centuries, only two away from securing a £100,000 prize for making 100 in one season.He had missed the pre-tournament media day because of illness, with his preparations hampered by a bout of tonsillitis and a neck injury, but he had not contemplated withdrawing."I had two injuries, luckily both have gone," said Trump. "The neck injury was the worse one and I managed to get treatment just in time. I'd just been practising every day and I woke up and couldn't look to one side."I always turn up and play, but I probably wouldn't have won."On facing Murphy next, Trump added: "He looked superb in his first game here and had one of the best performances of his career at the Masters. I will have to play close to my level today."Murphy was part of the BBC Two commentary team for Trump's match and was full of praise for his next opponent."That's the performance of the world number one, that's exactly how the world number one should play," said Murphy. "Five frames, four centuries, it doesn't get much better than that."We have had some good matches this season, he has won them all, they've all been very high standard and the next one will possibly be the best of them all. How do I plan for the next match? I've got no idea."Four-time champion Mark Selby was involved in the last match of the night against English qualifier Ben Woollaston.Selby started with a break of 100 but then fell 4-2 behind, only to win the final three frames of the session, including a break of 135 in frame nine, to hold a 5-4 advantage before Thursday's conclusion (19:00 BST).Meanwhile, 2023 world champion Luca Brecel won the last three frames of his first session against Ryan Day but still trails the experienced Welshman 5-4.Day knocked in a superb 126 break in the opener and was 5-1 up against the world number seven from Belgium, who managed only 120 points in the first six frames.But Brecel recovered with breaks of 104, 54 and 86 to be only one frame behind for Thursday's final session.Related topicsSnookerComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 220Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8180 viewing8.2k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
