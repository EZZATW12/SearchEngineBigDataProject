The progress is mind-blowing, constantly dropping time," he told BBC Radio Shropshire."We're going into a World Championships in the summer and I've just put in one of the best swims of all time, half a second off a world record (51.60). It is getting really exciting."The action in Singapore runs between July 11 and August 3, and Morgan feels he is capable of success.He reached the Olympic final in Paris last year, finishing eighth in a time of 52.84."I would have been 0.1 seconds off winning in Paris with my time last week," said Morgan."I feel like I can compete 100%, you're never going to get a perfect swim, but it is how close we can get to it."I find if I'm performing to the best of my capabilities it'll be difficult for anyone to beat me. You've got to stay humble and grounded."Related topicsSwimmingTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8295 viewing8.3k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
