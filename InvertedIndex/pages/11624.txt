"I didn't quite know where I would be at this meet and have surprised myself quite a lot. Buzzing with that."Richards, the 2023 world 200m freestyle champion, won the British title last year. "That was always the plan, to try to win a bit different," he said about his strategy in going off so quickly."With that pre-selection, it meant that I could try to swim in a way I that I've not done before. I can probably confirm I won't be doing that again in the summer."Ben Proud added to his men's 50m freestyle victory by winning the 50m butterfly final in 23.21. Angharad Evans, 21, broke her own British record to claim the women's 100m breaststroke title in 1:05.37, while 24-year-old Freya Anderson won the women's 100m freestyle in 54.09.
