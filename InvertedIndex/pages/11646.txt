"I'm really grateful to have the chance to test our routines at the big competitions, so I'm just really happy and I can't really believe this has happened."The victory came in the same city where Kate Shortman and Izzy Thorpe won duet silver last year to claim Britain's first Olympic medal in the sport and their performance has inspired Tomblin."Kate  and Izzy are really opening the door for us as a newer generation of athletes," he added. "They've made us realise that Great Britain is actually quite good at this sport, and that has given us a lot of confidence."When you win medals, it's definitely like, 'oh look, look at what I'm doing' - and it really shows what all the hard work is doing for us."Related topicsSwimmingArtistic SwimmingMore on this storyTomblin wants to change view of artistic swimmingPublished20 June 2023Shortman and Thorpe win historic artistic swimming medalPublished10 August 2024Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8388 viewing8.4k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
