Gold medal. Olympic record.Safe to say Macron wasn't paying all that much attention to the boy from Alloa in lane three who claimed 200m individual medley silver to make his own mark. Marchand might not have been either. But Duncan Scott got about as near to the 22-year-old as anyone else has during his staggering run of races this week.Scott becomes Scotland's most decorated OlympianPublished2 August 2024Scott shuns Sir Chris Hoy comparisons after Olympic goldPublished31 July 2024Scott is quiet man making a big noisePublished23 July 2024He beat the Frenchman in the semi-finals of this event on Thursday, but it is fair to say Marchand was holding a wee bit in. He had had a heavy week, after all, carrying all those new bits of metal around.The home favourite uncorked the good stuff on Friday when it mattered though. His third Olympic record in three finals this meet. The boy has something about him."The guy is... I did all right going head to head with him for a bit but that's rapid," Scott said of Marchand, who won by more than a second. "He's turned into an absolute world sensation. "From 2022 onwards, I knew he was going to be pretty good but what he has been able to do this week is amazing and it's inspirational."'I shouldn't be in same sentence as Hoy & Murray'Scott has played this game for a while, though. He has been to big events and has both the medals and the scars to show for it.He swaggered out into this magnificent drum of noise with a gallus grin, licked his lips, made straight for Marchand's blocks, and gave them a shunt. Then he had a poke around in his box. A wee bit of mind games? Why not. Given how good the Frenchman is, the 27-year-old had to try something. Eighth after the butterfly, Scott roared back to sit fourth after the backstroke. His breaststroke took him up to second but the freestyle specialist could not do enough to overhaul Marchand down the last 50m.Scott swam his quickest time since the last Olympic final - just three-hundredths of a second outside the mark that earned him silver in Tokyo - but it was not enough for a first individual gold.All the latest on the Scottish athletes at the OlympicsWhat to expect from the Scots on Saturday at the OlympicsPublished2 August 2024It was sufficient, though, to earn him the title of Scotland's most decorated Olympic athlete, with his two gold and six silvers taking him beyond cyclist Sir Chris Hoy.Scott - while thrilled with his night's work - was not having any of that talk, though. "I mean... I shouldn't be in the same sentence as that guy or Andy Murray," he told BBC Scotland. "Those two have been a huge inspiration to everything I've done. "Sure, I've got a few medals but I couldn't have got this many without being part of a load of fantastic relays."Might there be more of those relays to come over the next couple of days? Despite not planning to have them in his schedule for this meet, Scott is now keen for a role in either the mixed or men's 4x100m medley. Hoy's mark might not only be beaten, but eclipsed entirely by Sunday night."I'm always going to throw my hand up," said Scott, after embracing his Saltire-wielding family in the stands as the cameras cut to the aforementioned Murray amid the crowd."I just love racing in these environments and it brings something special out of me. Back-to-back silvers in the 200m IM is pretty cool and what a night it's been."Related topicsOlympic GamesTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9509 viewing9.5k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Scottish sportWhat is still to be decided as season reaches climax?League reconstruction - why, when & what might it look like?Scotland men's internationals to be shown live on BBCCommonwealth Games: Why is it so special to be part of Team Scotland?From titles to tinpottery - rank Scotland's top 10 clubsElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
