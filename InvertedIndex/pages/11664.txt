The time says differently. It's not a sport where it's up for debate, it's black and white."I can't be too disappointed. Obviously two one hundredths off gold is excruciatingly frustrating. If anything it has added more fire to my belly.”The medal was Team GB's sixth of day three and takes their current total in Paris to 10.In the previous race, Britain's Freya Colbert was fourth in the 400m medley, missing out on a medal by 0.74secs, as 17-year-old Canadian sensation Summer McIntosh won the first of what will surely be many Olympic golds.Later, Mona McSharry won Ireland's first medal of the Games with bronze in the 100m breaststroke.Today's Olympics guidePublished10 August 2024Full Paris Olympics scheduleBBC's Paris Olympics TV schedulePublished26 July 2024'It's all learning' - Richards so close to gold This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, After an amazing 200m freestyle final, swimmer Matt Richards takes home the silver medal.Richards was part of Great Britain's 4x200m relay team that won gold in Tokyo, as was Scott, but this was his first individual Olympic medal.Richards won the 2023 world title last year but had not yet hit top form in Paris.He and Scott were in the 100m freestyle relay quartet that finished fifth on day one and his middling semi-final time left him in an outside lane, where the waves are bigger and quick times are rarely achieved.But he overcame that expertly and was in contention for a medal throughout.Popovici, who announced himself in 2022, aged 17, by winning the 100m and 200m gold at the World Championships, looked to be struggling at the start of the fourth and final length but he dug deep to win in 1:44.72."I misjudged the semi-final a bit," Richards said. "Being out there meant I was a little bit out of the race and I had to swim on my own."It is all learning. I want another 10 years before even thinking about hanging the goggles up."Scott was bidding for a seventh Olympic medal, another to go with his relay gold and five silvers, but was beaten to bronze by 0.08secs."Fourth is a horrible place to come," the Scot said."I was buzzing going into that, had really good fun in there, and looking back I maybe should have pushed it on a bit earlier. It was really tight, came down to the finish and I didn't quite have it today."Such is Britain's strength in depth in this event, Olympic champion Tom Dean was beaten by Richards and Scott at the trials in April and did not qualify.The trio will now unite on Tuesday as they bid to defend their relay title, first in the morning heats, although Richards or Scott could be rested before a potential final at 21:01 BST.Richards also has the 100m freestyle starting on Tuesday, in which he will hope to be among the medals again."Myself and Duncan, second and fourth, I am gutted for him, just missing out on a medal," Richards said."It bodes really well for the 4x200m."McIntosh announces herself on Olympic stageThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, 'What a swim!' - Summer McIntosh, 17, wins gold in women's 400m individual medleyColbert's fourth place was the same position team-mate Max Litchfield finished in the equivalent men's event 24 hours earlier - the third time in a row he had finished fourth at the Olympics."Hopefully I don't have the curse like Max does," Colbert said. "Having trained every day with him and seeing the amount of work he has put in, it was just really disappointing. I wanted to win that medal for both of us tonight but we'll just have to keep pushing for next time."Ahead of Colbert, McIntosh was a comfortable winner, beating USA's Katie Grimes and Emma Weyant into second and third respectively in her breakout moment on the world stage.Already a teenage three-time world champion and world record holder, McIntosh took silver in the 400m freestyle on Saturday and could still win another three medals in Paris.Scotland's Katie Shanahan was seventh.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, 'Outstanding' McSharry wins women's 100m breaststroke bronze for IrelandMcSharry's breaststroke bronze made her just the second Irish swimming medallist as she came through amid competition from Britain's Angharad Evans and others.Evans finished in sixth, just 0.26secs outside of the medals, while South Africa's Tatjana Smith took gold.In the men's 100m backstroke final, Britain's Ollie Morgan finished eighth as world record holder Thomas Ceccon won Italy's second swimming gold in as many days.And in the final race of the night Mollie O'Callaghan beat her Australia team-mate and training partner Ariarne Titmus in the 200m freestyle, denying her a second gold of the Games.Related topicsSwimmingOlympic GamesComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 79Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9509 viewing9.5k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
