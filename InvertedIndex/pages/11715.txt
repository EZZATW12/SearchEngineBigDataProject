The history stuff is pretty special."Asked what is the secret to their success, he added: "We trust each other. Being away from home most of the time, we have to support one another."The Swiss had qualified directly for the semi-finals by topping Pool A ahead of Mouat, whose only defeat came at the hands of Whyte's rink.It meant Team Mouat had to face world number two rink Team Jacobs, but they came through that challenge 6-2 as Schwaller's third-ranked Swiss dispatching the other Canadian semi-finalists, fourth-ranked Team Dunstone.In the final, Schwaller took singles at the opening end and third, but the Scots hit back to lead 5-3 going into the eighth end, only for the Swiss to score two and force an extra end.The Swiss were lying one as Mouat prepared to throw the final stone of the Grand Slam of Curling season and he played a perfect shot against his rival's guard and on to his own stone to score the winning shot."Knowing that we're the only team to have done this is amazing, so it's a pretty incredible feeling and I'm a little overwhelmed with all the emotions, which I think I showed in that last shot," Mouat added.Related topicsCurlingTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9197 viewing9.2k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Scottish sportWhat is still to be decided as season reaches climax?League reconstruction - why, when & what might it look like?Scotland men's internationals to be shown live on BBCCommonwealth Games: Why is it so special to be part of Team Scotland?From titles to tinpottery - rank Scotland's top 10 clubsElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
