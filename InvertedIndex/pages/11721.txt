"We have had some amazing highs and lows, but this is the highest of the highs. "It's top tier. I have described it as like Wimbledon for us."As against the Swedes and Canadians, the Scots had the disadvantage of starting the final with their opponents having last stone advantage.For the third match in a row, Mouat forced his opponents to score one at the opening end and, after three consecutive blank ends, the Scots scored two in the fifth end to edge in front.Their opponents retook a narrow lead with a two of their own in the sixth, but the momentum - and the lead - changed hands again with a two for Scotland before Switzerland levelled the scores in the eighth end.A blank ninth end set up a tense finish, but the Scots held their nerve to come out on top in an epic encounter as Mouat celebrated on the ice with teammates Grant Hardie, Bobby Lammie and Hammy McMillan after he curled a stone into the middle of the house to take the title."It was a bit of a pinch me moment to get to draw the four foot to win a World Championship," the 30-year-old Scotland skip added. "That's something I've dreamt of for a long time."Playing in Canada is unbelievable, the crowds you get."For Mouat, who first won the world title two years ago, it was the sixth win in nine major championship finals.His rink now join fellow Scots Team Whyte, who won The Masters in January, at the the final Grand Slam of Curling event of the season this week in Toronto looking to complete a full set of wins by Scottish teams in the major men's competitions this season.The curtain raiser to that will be a first-ever Battle of the Sexes match against Rachel Homan's women's world champions from Canada.Related topicsCurlingComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 259Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9197 viewing9.2k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Scottish sportWhat is still to be decided as season reaches climax?League reconstruction - why, when & what might it look like?Scotland men's internationals to be shown live on BBCCommonwealth Games: Why is it so special to be part of Team Scotland?From titles to tinpottery - rank Scotland's top 10 clubsElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
