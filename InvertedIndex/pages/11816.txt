He and the skipper frustrated the home attack for 96 minutes, extending their partnership to 87 runs before, facing the second new ball, the younger man clipped Brett Hutton straight to midwicket, where sub fielder Freddie McCann had been moved from slip moments earlier.Carson batted for two hours and 18 minutes for his 43, which contained five fours.With an important obstacle removed, the Sussex innings fell away quickly. Ahmed, called into the attack with the new ball only 12 overs old, needed just one delivery with it to have Ollie Robinson caught behind.Left to eke out what he could, Simpson perished in Ahmed's next over, caught by Josh Tongue in a failed attempt to clear the long-on boundary.The Nottinghamshire target was heading towards the territory that Sussex felt might have been tricky in the overcast conditions of Saturday, but Hameed quickly made it look much less daunting as warm sunshine presented the best batting conditions of the match.It did not help Sussex's cause that Jayden Seales, who played his part in reducing Nottinghamshire from 167 for three to 210 for eight on the second morning, slipped back into his wayward ways of Friday evening, handing Hameed plenty of opportunities to give himself a flying start, which he eagerly snapped up.In his opening two overs from the Stuart Broad End he conceded four boundaries to Hameed, coming back for a third at the Radcliffe Road End to see Ben Slater hammer him for six and four. Little wonder, when Slater pulled him to be caught at deep square leg in his fourth over, he declined to celebrate.Nottinghamshire had polished off 67 of their required runs in 14.2 overs with Slater's dismissal, which only ushered in Duckett, looking to make amends after falling in single figures in the first innings of one of his nowadays rare appearances in the Championship.Five fours and four sixes - all off the unfortunate Carson – as he raced to a half-century in 23 balls confirmed that impression. Hameed's 50 from 71 balls, though beautiful to watch, looked pedestrian by comparison. And it was Hameed who hit the winning run with the result wrapped up at 3.27pm.After 21 wickets in four matches, the end of O'Neill's stint at Trent Bridge will leave a hole in the Nottinghamshire attack, although his replacement, Pakistan's Mohammad Abbas, arrives in time for their next fixture, against his former county, Hampshire, on 9 May.ECB Reporters' Network supported by Rothesay.Related topicsNottinghamshireSussexCricketComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 53Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9157 viewing9.2k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished3 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
