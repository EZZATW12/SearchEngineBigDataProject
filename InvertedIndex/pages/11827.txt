The Seagulls had been on a three-match losing streak before their trip to Walton Hall Park, but Parris raced clear to fire past Courtney Brosnan for a precious three points.Hosts Everton had been aiming to pick up a second successive home league win and twice led.Full-back Sara Holmgaard's back-post volley slammed into the turf and over the head of Brighton keeper Melina Loeck after nine minutes, before Michelle Agyemang's close-range equaliser was then cancelled out by Katja Snoeijs' superb first-time volley two minutes later.Forward Fran Kirby then executed a neat give-and-go with Parris in the box before curling a 44th-minute finish with the outside of the foot into the top corner for a second equaliser.The visitors were left aggrieved in the second half as both Parris and Agyemang were bundled over in the box, but their penalty appeals were rejected.Parris' goal in the third minute of added time secured Brighton's first ever league double over Everton after the Seagulls won the reverse fixture between the sides 4-0 on the opening day of the season.Having come through the Everton academy and made 38 senior appearances, the England international has since scored nine league goals against them.The victory moved Brighton level on points with Liverpool in fifth spot, but ahead on goal difference.Everton, though, remain eighth in the table and visit Liverpool in a Merseyside derby on Sunday, 4 May.Seagulls push fine margins in their favourImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Brighton showed attacking quality in their comebackIn the build-up to the Everton trip, Brighton boss Dario Vidosic said he wanted his side to "end the season on a positive note " - and Parris' last-gasp winner can now provide the platform for that.The Seagulls had been on a wretched run in the Women's Super League, losing their last three by a single-goal margin.But they showed great resilience, tenacity and persistence on Sunday to push the fine margins in their favour.It's granted their start was far from ideal, conceding first and going behind again two minutes after pulling level.However, Brighton's attacking quality proved the ace up their sleeve this time.Parris was influential, playing a key role in Kirby's equaliser, laying the ball off for her team-mate to finish with aplomb.The 31-year-old then showed her killer instinct to take a touch, compose herself and fire into the bottom corner to snatch all three points for the Seagulls.While Brighton have had it tough of late, this success had all the hallmarks of their early season promise.It also provides hope they can hit the ground running in the 2025/26 campaign.The Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.
