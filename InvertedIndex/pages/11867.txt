"Oliver Glasner got it spot on and the big players showed up for them in what was a complete team performance. "And the fans turned up as well. I have read a lot about how loud the Palace fans were compared to the Aston Villa end. You could see how much it meant to them."As an old romantic, I hope Palace win the final because they have not won a major trophy before. They certainly have the chance to because although they play Manchester City, there are still some vulnerabilities in that side "We have seen it with Newcastle winning the Carabao Cup this season and it is a great story."Listen to the Football Daily podcast on BBC SoundsYour best snippets from the big Wembley day out...published at 09:0709:07Crystal Palace fans, we asked you to send in your photos from your magical day out at Wembley.It turned out to be a fantastic trip to the capital - definitely one for the memory books - so let's relive the whole experience!Image caption, Tony: A fantastic atmosphere at Wembley and a fantastic win for Crystal Palace.Image caption, Jane: Such an incredible day.

Ismaila Sarr is a criminally underrated signing of the season for Palace and improvements from players such as Will Hughes, Tyrick Mitchell and Dean Henderson have been immense. On their day, they can go toe to toe with anyone. Bring on the final!Jamie: Incredible. We dominated the famous Villa on the pitch and in the stands. I fancy us against whoever we play in the final. Up the Palace!Chris: Outstanding. Our best performance of the season (so far)! We could have, and perhaps should have, been 3-0 up at half-time. Then if you add the missed penalty and the two second-half goals... 10 out of 10 for all of the players, but 11 out of 10 for tactical genius Oliver Glasner.Bill: Very rarely do you have the pick of at least 11 players for man of the match. From Henderson's heroics to Sarr's lethal finishing, every single player turned up and played at their best. We thoroughly deserved the win and our place in the final.Al: To a man, we were exceptional. We executed the game plan perfectly and the only time Villa threatened to get on top was after the penalty miss. But the fans lifted the team and Sarr did the rest. Daichia Kamada's reincarnation as James McArthur is a great surprise too.Carolyn: The best birthday present. Well done Palace. The supporters were fantastic and there was a real family feel in the stands. Everyone was congratulating each other when the goals went in. It was a great way to celebrate.21:57 26 April'It's all about moments' - the goals Palace fans will never forget, published at 21:57 26 April'It's all about moments' - the goals Palace fans will never forgetAttributionCrystal Palace21:28 26 April'Glasner's FA Cup heroes give Tuchel food for thought', published at 21:28 26 April'Glasner's FA Cup heroes give Tuchel food for thought'AttributionCrystal PalaceComments45520:41 26 April'Unbelievable performance' - Glasner on Palace win.

They had to work so hard and they had to overcome a few difficult moments. We got more control and it was an unbelievable performance today. The players stuck to the plan and we never lost our heads."We had to make smaller adjustments. Villa played with the front four, a very narrow four and they always try to pass to their sixes. We said that our three attackers had to control their two sixes and two centre-halves."The first goal was about winning the ball and second goal was unbelievable counter-press from Adam Wharton. The players did excellent."I spoke to the chairman [Steve Parish] a few weeks ago and, if our start of the season had worked, I would get three months off this summer and then come back one week before the start of the Premier League!"The most important thing is everyone stayed calm in the club. The team are such great guys, they always believed in us and we have always had a great togetherness."On celebrating tonight: "I don't know at the moment, I feel a bit exhausted. The players have four days off now. The players should enjoy the moment."20:11 26 AprilWe're not fearful of anyone - Eze.

We haven't been on the greatest run of form, but the lads came out and put on a show today."We were waiting for those moments, we sat in the block and, with the pace we have got, we hit them on the break."If we can perform like we did today in the final, then anything is possible. The lads were outstanding. If we play like we did today, we can beat anyone."We have got to enjoy it, so we will be celebrating tonight."19:38 26 AprilSarr seals win with goal in stoppage time.
