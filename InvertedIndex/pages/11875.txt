It was box-to-box.  "It was an unbelievable feeling - it was 0-0 and we won on penalties."Ten-year-old Wharton took one of those spot-kicks, a cool finish beyond the goalkeeper, and no doubt he will provide Palace with a calm head should he be needed for penalty duty again on Saturday.While Palace are yet to win the FA Cup this will be their seventh appearance in the semi-finals of the competition.But they face a tough test against a Villa side in decent form, having won 10 of their past 12 games."I am excited," Wharton added. "It is a great opportunity to perform and have a chance to play for a trophy. We know it's going to be a tough game though."We believe we can [win] if we turn up and play how we know we can. Everyone is confident at the minute. "But we can't lower our standards because teams will punish us."You can watch the FA Cup semi-final between Crystal Palace and Aston Villa on BBC One, iPlayer and online on Saturday, 26 April (17:15).BBC to show Crystal Palace-Aston Villa semi-finalPublished4 AprilCrystal Palace beat Fulham to book FA Cup semi-final spotWharton soaring at EaglesWharton has been at Palace since joining from Blackburn in February 2024, when he hit the ground running, playing a crucial part as Palace won six of their final seven games in the Premier League and securing a place in the England squad for Euro 2024.However, Wharton was managing a groin issue at the beginning of this season which then required surgery, keeping him out for two months and missing 14 Premier League games.His absence coincided with a slow start to the season for Palace but since his return to fitness the Eagles have been soaring, having lost just two of their past 10 games, with Wharton producing a number of eye-catching displays."It has gone better than expected," Wharton said."When I first made the move I didn't expect to make the team as fast as I did. I probably had a bit of luck as well."I wanted to go somewhere I felt I had a chance of getting an opportunity and I saw Palace had given other players that opportunity."It is good to get that praise, but you can't let it get to your head. "I take the praise but don't it let affect me. I try and keep as level-headed as possible and try to improve every game."Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Adam Wharton joined Crystal Palace in February last yearPraise from Pep and long-term targetsOne of those to give Wharton praise was Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola, who recently described him as "excellent"., externalBut while Wharton welcomes the compliments he gets, he is just focused on becoming the very best player he can be."I had some friends sending me what Pep Guardiola said," said Wharton. "Obviously that is great to see but if he says that and I play terrible, it doesn't mean too much. "I am nowhere near where I want to be as a player. I am always looking to improve because no-one is ever perfect, are they?"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Adam Wharton has made 18 Premier League appearances for Crystal Palace this seasonRelated topicsFA CupCrystal PalaceFootballMore on this storyListen to the latest Football Daily podcastGet football news sent straight to your phonePublished31 JanuaryTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8215 viewing8.2k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished3 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
