But John Logsdon, the former director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, told BBC Newshour that the latest exchange of Moon rocks have "very little to do with politics".While there are controls on space technology, the examination of lunar samples had "nothing of military significance", he said. "It's international cooperation in science which is the norm."Washington has imposed tariffs Chinese goods that go up to 245%, while Beijing has hit back with 125% tariffs on US goods. US President Donald Trump previously hinted at a de-escalation in the trade war, but Beijing has denied that there were negotiations between the two sides.In 2023, the CNSA put out a call for applications to study its Chang'e-5 moon samples.What's special about the Chang'e-5 Moon samples is that they "seem to be a billion years younger" than those collected from Apollo missions, Dr Logsdon said. "So it suggests that volcanic activity went on in the moon more recently than people had thought".Space officials from the US and China had reportedly tried to negotiate an exchange of moon samples last year - but it appears the deal did not materialise.Besides Brown University and Stony Brook University in the US, the other winning bids came from institutions in France, Germany, Japan, Pakistan, the UK.Shan, from the CNSA, said the agency will "maintain an increasingly active and open stance" in international space exchange and cooperation, including along the space information corridor under the Belt and Road Initiative"I believe China's circle of friends in space will continue to grow," he said.AsiaChinaRelated'Her legacy will slay': Drag Race stars mourn Jiggly Caliente3 hrs agoAsiaMount Fuji climber rescued twice after going back for lost phone4 hrs agoAsiaN Korea confirms it sent troops to fight for Russia in Ukraine war4 hrs agoAsiaMore12 hrs agoBeijing seizes tiny sandbank in South China SeaThe Philippines, which disputes China's claim to the sandbank, responds by releasing a photo of its own forces on another.12 hrs agoAsia3 days agoChina has halted rare earth exports, can Australia step up?Australia has proposed to create a strategic reserve of critical minerals.3 days agoWorld3 days agoUK scientist given Moon samples from China missionProf Mahesh Anand is the first UK scientist chosen to receive samples from the 2020 Chang'e-5 probe.3 days agoBeds, Herts & Bucks4 days agoFive cards China holds in a trade war with the USFrom rare earths to billions in US debt, here's what China has in its arsenal - and how strong they are.4 days agoAsia5 days agoOpportunity for big US-China trade deal, says Bessent The comments from the US Treasury Secretary come as the trade war between the world's two biggest economies has escalated.5 days agoBusinessBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.
