Heat have already secured their knockout spot but could finish top, and automatically reach the final on 1 December, if they win and improve their net run-rate above Melbourne Renegades. 23:27 29 October 2024Scotland lose to Nepal by five wickets in Texas, published at 23:27 29 October 2024Scotland lose to Nepal by five wickets in TexasAttributionScotland18:55 20 October 2024Women's T20 World Cup: Results, reports, top run-scorers & wicket-takers, published at 18:55 20 October 2024Women's T20 World Cup: Results, reports, top run-scorers & wicket-takersAttributionWomen's Cricket18:44 15 October 2024Women's T20 World Cup - who is through and who is out?, published at 18:44 15 October 2024Women's T20 World Cup - who is through and who is out?AttributionCricket15:30 13 October 2024Goosebumps in 40C - Scotland women's first World Cup, published at 15:30 13 October 2024Goosebumps in 40C - Scotland women's first World CupAttributionScotland15:11 13 October 2024England's Bouchier & Wyatt-Hodge pick apart Scotland.
