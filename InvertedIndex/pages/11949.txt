The Tynecastle club parted ways with the Englishman on Saturday following a 1-0 defeat by Dundee in their first post-split game. The result leaves Hearts five points clear of Ross County in 11th with four matches of the season to play."I was surprised," McGowan told the BBC's Scottish Football Podcast. "I don't think he would have been there at the start of next season, but I was slightly surprised that they did decide to do it on Saturday night."I do think the club's slightly worried, after this weekend coming up, if results don't go their way, then it can really, really be tricky in terms of getting sucked into that play-off spot. "For a club the size of Hearts, it shouldn't even be an issue in terms of getting sucked into that play-off spot. So I think that's why the club's acted."Critchley took over from Steven Naismith back in October with the Edinburgh outfit bottom of the Premiership table. Fans questioned Critchley's ability to win high-stakes matches and McGowan says that can be traced back as far as December when they exited the Conference League.Hearts drew 2-2 with Moldovan minnows Petrocub, who were bottom of the competition table, a result which put them out of Europe on goals scored."The European campaign, going into the last game of that round to qualify against the worst team in that league and not coming away with a victory was the first sign of him not grasping the big games and being able to make his mark on the team," McGowan said. "Albeit he came in and sort of steadied the ship, but I kind of believed whoever came in would have probably steadied the ship at that point."I just think too many times this season he's maybe changed the team and changed the personnel. I'm not even sure he knows who his best 11 is or what formation that would be, he's kind of stumbled across it throughout the season."'Pressley willing to leave Brentford for Hearts job' - gossippublished at 07:4307:43Former Hearts captain Steven Pressley would be willing to leave his role as Brentford's head of individual development to help his old club, who have dismissed head coach Neil Critchley, steer clear of relegation trouble. (Daily Record), externalStephen Robinson would seem like an obvious and logical choice as the new Hearts head coach given his success with Scottish Premiership rivals St Mirren, but there are a number of other possible contenders. (The Scotsman), externalFalkirk manager John McGlynn is the bookmakers' favourite to be Hearts' new head coach, ahead of former Oxford United boss Des Buckingham and another former Tynecastle team boss, Robbie Neilson, who recently left Tampa Bay Rowdies. (The Herald), externalFormer Hearts team bosses John McGlynn, currently with Falkirk, and Robbie Neilson are among seven names who could be candidates for the Tynecastle job after applying the kind of criteria Jamestown Analytics might use to choose a shortlist. (Daily Record), externalHearts' partnership with Jamestown Analytics means that every head coach appointed is first scrutinised by its data system and, among the criteria candidates must adhere to, every team boss must be on board with using it for player recruitment or they will not get the job.

He will have his backers within the club without doubt.Liam Fox, who took interim charge when Steven Naismith was dismissed in the autumn, will again take the helm but is unlikely to have enough support or experience to be considered on a long-term basis.Other notable names to be mentioned will be Kilmarnock's Derek McInnes and Stephen Robinson of St Mirren, who have been linked with the job in the past.Regardless, whoever comes in will have to work with - and believe in - the use of analytics when it comes to recruitment, which could mean a left-field managerial appointment.'Critchley was out of his depth & so are Hearts board'published at 11:40 27 April11:40 27 AprilWe asked for your views on Neil Critchley's sacking following Hearts' home defeat to Dundee.Here's what some of you said:Nick: It is the easy option to sack the manager but once in a while take a look at the players and weed out the non-achievers, also what about the director of football? They seem to always miss the bullets.Alfred: The chief executive should bear the responsibility of appointing Steven Naismith and Neil Critchley and resign himself.Robert: Just not good enough, so it's for the best he goes now and we try a complete rebuild.David: Critchley was out his depth as much as the Hearts board are out their depth with regards to any football decisions. Changing the manager again doesn't deal with the core issue.Steve: Failed to get us into the top six. Failed to get us to the cup final and dragging us into a relegation battle. Clueless. Correct decision.Fraser: Hearts haven't been good enough for years. Another under-par manager in the spotlight. Huge loyal fanbase which has seen a very little return. Next appointment needs to be a huge name that's proven themselves in the game and has the ability to attract high performing players and bring some joy back to Hearts.Hearts 0-1 Dundee: Key statspublished at 09:16 27 April09:16 27 AprilImage source, SNSHearts have failed to win in their last four games in the Premiership, their last longer winless streak was from 15 May 2024 to 6 October 2024, a run of 10 games.Simon Murray has scored 16 goals in the Premiership this season (one in this game), more than any other Dundee player.Hearts attempted 624 passes in this match, higher than their season average of 436.7 in the Premiership.Dundee have a record of W6, D0, L3 when leading at half time in the Premiership this season.08:27 27 AprilWhere did it go wrong and is McGlynn next for Hearts?, published at 08:27 27 AprilWhere did it go wrong and is McGlynn next for Hearts?AttributionHeartsHow did Critchley's tenure unfold?published at 21:35 26 April21:35 26 AprilBrian McLauchlinBBC Sport Scotland Senior ReporterImage source, SNSWhen Neil Critchley was appointed in October, many Hearts fans had never heard of the former Liverpool youth coach.Sure, he had managed Queens Park Rangers and Blackpool (on two separate occasions) but remained pretty much an unknown quantity.Chief executive officer Andrew McKinlay refuted suggestions Critchley was the club's second choice because talks had broken down with former Norway boss Per-Mathias Hogmo.And two wins in his first opening games appeared to show the Hearts board - or data partner Jamestown Analytics, who were heavily involved in the decision - had identified the right man.However, just three victories against the Premiership's bottom two teams in the next 14 matches followed.Included in this run was a wretched performance against Moldovan minnows Petrocub at Tynecastle when a victory would have ensured European football would continue after Christmas.Other big-game setbacks came against Celtic, Rangers and local rivals Hibernian, who resurrected their season after a similar dismal start to their campaign.Critchley wasn't helped by long-term injuries to key players, such as Frankie Kent, Stephen Kingsley and Craig Halkett. And when you add in the dip in form of striker Lawrence Shankland, the football gods were never really in his favour.However, he will accept that football is a results industry and those results were simply not there for him. 'Hearts board panicked - but Critchley never right for role'published at 21:05 26 April21:05 26 AprilImage source, SNSFormer Hearts midfielder Michael Stewart thinks the club have "panicked" by sacking Neil Critchley after just six months as head coach.The Tynecastle lost their first bottom-six game to Dundee after falling to Aberdeen in the Scottish Cup semi-final and although Stewart is "not surprised" by the decision to sack Critchley, who he said "was never a Hearts manager" he believes it leaves many questions needing asked of a club who "are trying to be too smart"."The club have panicked," the pundit said on Sportscene. "They are clearly concerned about being dragged into the relegation play-off spot."I'm not surprised. I've got a great deal of sympathy for Neil Critchley. He's a nice guy and clearly knows a lot about football, but he was never a Hearts manager."That's a bigger issue for me - who's making these appointments? Critchley was the seventh appointment since Ann Budge took the club out of administration and the track record has not been great."With this one, the board basically absolved themselves of any responsibility for it and handed the decision over the Jamestown Analytics. When Neil Critchley's name was mooted, I don't think a single person associated with Hearts thought 'oh, that's a good appointment'. You cannot just take a step back and give full responsibility to someone else."Jamestown Analytics was heralded as the tool that could have Hearts challenge for the title but they've not been able to get a manager who could last a season and that undermines it. Look at some of the signings they've made, yes they made some good signings in January, but they spend £400,000 on Sander Kartum, who's not the kind of player they needed. And because of additions like that, Critchley has ended up losing his job."I don't think it's rocket science. Far too often, it feels like they are trying to be too smart and do things differently rather than just doing football things properly. Hearts are arguably the third biggest club in the country and should be there challenging every season. But they're bottom six and not maximising what they've got."Have your say on Critchley’s exitpublished at 20:03 26 April20:03 26 AprilHearts fans, we want to hear from you in the aftermath of Neil Critchley’s sacking after just six months.Let us know how you’re feeling about things here.19:52 26 AprilWatch Critchley's last interview as Hearts head coach.

We didn't do enough. We had total control of the game. The longer it went on... we played too safe, lacked belief in what we were doing, lacked quality."We had some chances to score, but don't score the first goal. They then put everyone behind the ball and that makes it doubly difficult for us. That's been the story of the last few weeks, little things not going for us. That's on us, we need to change that very quickly."That's football for you. We must respond to this. We're in a fight and we have to show the right level of fight. I don't think it was lack of effort today. From the halfway line, we lacked quality in our decision making."We have to stick together, we've got four games to go. It's important the players show the fight and commitment that will get us out of this situation. We need to show more quality and intelligence."I understand the frustration when we don't score at home and get beat. I'm comfortable with [the expectation]. I believe that I'm the man to get us out of this situation and move the club forward in the future."Emotions are running high, I just have to focus on the here and now, the players, and making sure we're ready for Ross County next week."Hearts 0-1 Dundee: Analysispublished at 17:15 26 April17:15 26 AprilAndrew PetrieBBC Sport ScotlandImage source, SNSImage caption, Elton Kabangu missed a real sitter in the first halfIf any Hearts fans had forgotten the relegation fears of earlier in the season, they were rudely reminded this afternoon.While their side dominated possession, it was always Dundee who wanted it more.Some would argue that was surprising, given the fight that Hearts showed at Hampden just seven days ago. That same courage was not apparent today.The only creativity came from left-back James Penrice - who was too often forced to stay back, given the lack of protection in front of him.Kabangu's form, similar to teammate Lawrence Shankland who was missing through injury, has nosedived and the striker should have had a far bigger impact on the scoreline.The lack of wide options, or quality in wide areas, has been badly exposed and Critchley seemingly does not have the answers.Blair Spittal and Sander Kartum, deployed wide of Jorge Grant today, are both more suited to central roles. The only proper wide option on the bench, Alan Forrest, isn't fancied.Critchley inherited an imbalanced squad. Instead of addressing that in January, he tipped the scales further.Hearts seek contract answers - gossippublished at 09:00 26 April09:00 26 AprilHearts head coach Neil Critchley wants answers regarding soon to be out of contract players Craig Gordon and Lawrence Shankland by the end of the season.

Unless you're very fortunate, there'll be plenty more downs than there are ups."Resilience is a key characteristic of any player or head coach and you have to overcome disappointment. That process has started this week. It'll continue tomorrow and we have five games and 15 points to play for."Dundee occupy the relegation play-off spot and are six points behind seventh-place Hearts. Critchley says there is no fear at Tynecastle over a potential relegation battle."We're just thinking about winning the next game," he said. "We know that everyone's going to be fighting for their lives."Dundee will be no different. We need to make sure that we're there, ready to play the game that we can play. The results or the outcomes of some of the games recently we don't believe have gone our way."You have to accept that. We want that winning feeling back."Critchley on need for 'resilience', no 'blame culture' & Shankland fitnesspublished at 14:43 25 April14:43 25 AprilBrian McLauchlinBBC Sport Scotland Senior ReporterImage source, SNSNeil Critchley has been speaking to the media before Hearts face Dundee in the Premiership this weekend.Here are the key points from the Tynecastle boss:On a "tough few days" after the Scottish Cup semi-final defeat: "I think you need time to process that type of game and how it ended. But then you have to gradually move forward and turn the disappointment into motivation. And that motivation has to become your energy, which I've seen within the group."Critchley says Hearts need to show "resilience" in their final five games of this season to prove this group can be successful in the future.The Englishman fully supports the club statement regarding an "accumulation" of decisions the club perceive to have gone against them in recent matches. He confirms there has been dialogue between the club and the Scottish FA.Despite that, he insists there is no "blame culture" at the club and says they alone are responsible for failures in both the league and Scottish Cup.After missing out on European football, Critchley says is no change to the plans as they try to "keep improving the squad and the club".There has been no talk of being dragged into a relegation battle with the next game against Dundee being the full focus.Lawrence Shankland has trained but will be assessed before the game after struggling with tightness in his hamstring.Hearts v Dundee: Pick of the statspublished at 11:25 24 April11:25 24 AprilImage source, SNSHearts have won their past three Scottish Premiership home games against Dundee, last winning more in a row on home soil against them in the top fight from September 1999 to November 2001 (six).Dundee have lost five of their past six league meetings with Hearts, winning the other 3-1 in August this season.Hearts have failed to score in their past three league games despite attempting 34 shots (11 on target) worth 3.35 expected goals. Hearts last went four without scoring in the Scottish Premiership in November 2018.Only Kilmarnock have kept fewer clean sheets (0) and conceded more goals (41) away from home in the Scottish Premiership this season than Dundee (one clean sheet, 35 goals conceded), who have shipped 2+ goals in each of their last five on the road (17 in total).Dundee's games in the Scottish Premiership this season have seen more goals (121 – 50 for, 71 against) than any other side, while only Dundee United's (81) have had fewer than Hearts' (87 – 43 for, 44 against).08:48 24 AprilWhat do stats say about Premiership after the split?, published at 08:48 24 AprilWhat do stats say about Premiership after the split?AttributionScottish PremAre Hearts still 'moving in right direction'?published at 13:33 23 April13:33 23 AprilImage source, SNSAfter being consigned to the Premiership's bottom six before suffering Scottish Cup semi-final heartbreak on Saturday, would it be controversial to say Hearts are still "moving in the right direction"?Perhaps, but The Herald football writer Stephen McGowan feels there is no need for the Tynecastle club to overreact amid a disappointing campaign.A growing number of fans have started to doubt head coach Neil Critchley, who has faced intense criticism for failing to achieve a statement result in big games since his appointment earlier this campaign.McGowan feels that narrative could cause the Hearts boss a problem if he is unable to put an end to it, but he believes the Englishman deserves more time to improve the team with the help of Jamestown Analytics' player recruitment model."If you look at the record against Celtic, Rangers, Aberdeen and Hibs, it's problematic for any Hearts manager because you have to win those big games," McGowan told the BBC's Scottish Football Podcast."I think what you would say is when he came in, Hearts were bottom and they have absolutely improved things since then."His point that if he'd been in from the start of season then they wouldn't be in anything like this situation is probably fair."It's massively disappointing to miss out on the cup final, but I don't think there should be an overreaction to missing out on the top six. "I think Hearts are still moving in the right direction and Jamestown Analytics have to be given time and opportunity to prove the standard of player they are signing. "The question is whether Critchley is the man to deliver the sustained improvement they're looking for. Personally, I wouldn't overreact."Former Hearts defender Clunie diespublished at 10:27 23 April10:27 23 AprilImage source, SNSFormer Hearts defender Dave Clunie has died at the age of 77.Edinburgh-born Clunie made 354 appearances for the club between 1964 and 1977.After leaving Tynecastle he spent a season with St Johnstone before retiring in summer 1978.Can Critchley still convince sceptical supporters?published at 12:22 22 April12:22 22 AprilGreg PlayfairFan writerAs Hector Nicol's song goes, 'There is no other team to compare with the Hearts' and it probably sums up our season perfectly.Only Hearts could go from pre-season optimism about domestic and European football to spending 30 out of 33 weeks in the bottom half of the table, stumbling against the worst side in the Conference League and an early League Cup exit to Championship Falkirk.The Scottish Cup provided our last opportunity to salvage any positivity from this season, but instead there's been glorious failure being celebrated at being knocked out at the semi-final stage to Aberdeen. Good thing that's not a lyric in Nicol's song.Of course, we had to play almost 80 minutes with a man fewer and for four minutes we were down to nine but that late Aberdeen winner could have been scripted before a ball was kicked.Michael Steinwender's sending off before half-time is unfortunately a clear red card.  The second booking for Cammy Devlin was ludicrous but I'm not keen to say that is solely the reason why we lost.Should Neil Critchley have subbed the already cautioned Devlin, instead of Beni Baningime, for Blair Spittal given the Australia midfielder had already made a number of fouls before his second booking? There's been much said among Hearts supporters about where this defeat leaves Critchley. It cannot be ignored he has done well against 'lesser lights' in the league, including the 6-0 victory at Dundee as well as good wins at Tannadice and in his first European game versus Omonia Nicosia.The much-vaunted league table since Neil Critchley's arrival would have us fourth behind the Old Firm and Hibs, which is great on paper and would make it seem mad we're even talking about his future.The case for the prosecution is we will go a league season failing to chalk up even one win against Celtic, Rangers, Aberdeen or Hibs.For some supporters, back-to-back defeats against Hibs is bad enough. Add in the Petrocub performance in Europe and the fact we haven't won in four games now - with a 'must not lose' game looming against Dundee at Tynecastle on Saturday - and the pressure is really on the head coach.I really want Critchley to be a success, but from the body of evidence we've seen, I'm not convinced he can turn round the perception from a lot of Jambos that he's just not cut out for the role.My fear is we're kicking the can down the road with Critchley and we've seen this movie before with Hearts managers when they start to lose the backing of the fans. Very rarely – if ever – in modern times do they recover.previous pagePage 1 of 42123456…42next pageHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright © 2025 BBC.
