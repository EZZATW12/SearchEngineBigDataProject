Played well then dropped their level for a short time and get punished. Defensively, especially down our right-hand side, we were very poor.Les: Simo Valakari talks well but the performances are just nowhere near good enough. We would probably need to win all four now and that just isn't going to happen. Our chairman has a huge decision to make irrespective of what happens now. Is Simo the man to take us forward? I'm not sure at all on this one.Jimmy: Our defensive issues have caused us points. Personally speaking, I don't think the team are playing that badly, just that things haven't gone our way this season. There are still enough points to win in the upcoming games that should see us climb off the bottom. Some fans are criticising the players for not putting enough effort in and head coach for his team selection, but I think they know what's needed and he's doing a decent job.Motherwell 3-2 St Johnstone: Key statspublished at 09:46 27 April09:46 27 AprilImage source, SNSMotherwell have won after conceding the opening goal in the Premiership for the first time since 28 September 2024 against St Mirren (13 games without a win).St Johnstone have lost after scoring the opening goal in the Premiership for the first time since 26 December 2024 against Dundee United (five games without defeat).Motherwell attempted 360 passes in this match, higher than their season average of 310.1 in the Premiership.St Johnstone have lost 20 points from winning positions in the Premiership this season, only Dundee (23) have lost more.Motherwell 3-2 St Johnstone: Have your saypublished at 17:49 26 April17:49 26 AprilSt Johnstone fans, what did you make of that one?

It's difficult to win the match when you concede three goals."It's hard to criticise my players though, they put in everything."There was a lot of good performances. Yes, the result was not what we were hoping but next home match we don't have any other choice than to win."When you change your backline you lose the connection between the players."The only medicine for this is to win the next game."We need some other results to go our way now too. At the same time, we can only do what we can do and we need to start winning football matches."The boys want to do well but unfortunately we get no points. That's how football works when you are bottom of the league."Motherwell 3-2 St Johnstone: Analysispublished at 17:36 26 April17:36 26 AprilCalum MacDonaldBBC Sport ScotlandImage source, SNSAt one point in the afternoon St Johnstone were just two points behind Dundee in the live table, but the turnaround at Fir Park coupled with results elsewhere means Simo Valakari's side are now six points behind second bottom Ross County.Today's game was the season in microcosm for the Perth Saints, they were playing some nice stuff, ahead and looking comfortable after 35 minutes, but much like last weekend the 10 minutes before the break proved crucial, they came back into the match in the last 20 minutes but were unable to fashion an equaliser.Escaping relegation isn't yet impossible, but it looks increasingly unlikely.17:15 26 AprilStruggling St Johnstone six adrift after losing at Motherwell, published at 17:15 26 AprilStruggling St Johnstone six adrift after losing at MotherwellAttributionScottish PremSidibeh wants to be Saints survival hero - gossippublished at 09:02 26 April09:02 26 AprilForward Adama Sidibeh, 26, wants to be St Johnstone's survival hero again.

When we perform, we are likely to get a result. There will be twists and turns in these five games. I have said it many times, you need to enjoy these moments."Yes, the pressure is there, and you could call it negative pressure because we are playing to not get relegated. But you need to enjoy the pressure."We need to focus on our own. We can't control what happens in other games. Let's take care of our performance, then we can see what is happening."Striker Adama Sidibeh insists Saints must "stick together" if they are to stand any chance of staying up."We're going to try and give everything that we can for the last five games, we have to try and stick together and fight," he said."These last five games, every game is a final because the gap is not big. We're confident, we have to try and do what we can and get the three points."Player to watch: Uche Ikpeazupublished at 13:29 25 April13:29 25 AprilClive LindsayBBC Sport ScotlandImage source, SNSWhether or not Uche Ikpeazu proves to be St Johnstone's saviour, they certainly need one.Having been swept aside 5-0 by Scottish Cup holders Celtic in Sunday's semi-final, it is back to the task of trying to retain their Premiership status against the odds as they visit eighth-placed Motherwell.Five points behind Dundee at the foot of the table with five games remaining, time is running out for Simo Valakari's side.The Finn has to find a spark from somewhere and the long-awaited return of Ikpeazu from injury might just be it.A 15-minute cameo at Hampden marked the striker's Saints debut, 11 months and five knee operations since he signed after leaving Port Vale.Now the London-born 30-year-old will hope to make a similar impact in Perth as he did in his first stint in the Scottish top flight with Hearts.He initially became a bit of a folk hero, and wild speculation even linked him with Celtic and Rangers, but he would head off to Wycombe Wanderers in summer 2020 after losing his place at Tynecastle.Ikpeazu has never been a regular scorer and has found the net just nine times for five clubs in the four years before his return to Scotland.However, he has an imposing presence, can bring others into the game and could prove an effective partner for veteran Nick Clark, who has scored three goals and provided two assists in his past seven league appearances against Motherwell, despite only starting five of them.Indeed, Clark has scored in both of his past two Premiership games at Fir Park.Read the rest of this weekend's Premiership picks.Motherwell v St Johnstone: Pick of the statspublished at 13:05 24 April13:05 24 AprilImage source, SNSMotherwell won their first home league game against St Johnstone this season 2-1 in November, but haven't beaten the Perth side twice on home soil within a single league campaign since 2013-14.After their 2-1 win in January, St Johnstone could win back-to-back league meetings with Motherwell for the first time since August 2022, and first time within a single season since May 2016.Since the start of 2025, no side has picked up fewer points in the Scottish Premiership than Motherwell (12, level with Dundee).St Johnstone have won just one of their past 11 away league outings (D2 L8), a 1-0 victory at St Mirren in February.St Johnstone's Nicky Clark has been directly involved in five goals in his past seven league appearances against Motherwell (three goals, two assists), despite only starting five of those seven games. Clark has scored in both of his past two Scottish Premiership games at Fir Park.08:48 24 AprilWhat do stats say about Premiership after the split?, published at 08:48 24 AprilWhat do stats say about Premiership after the split?AttributionScottish PremClark leans on experience in great escape bidpublished at 13:55 23 April13:55 23 AprilTyrone SmithBBC Sport Scotland Senior ReporterImage source, SNSSt Johnstone striker Nicky Clark believes the experience of last season's Premiership relegation fight can hold them in good stead as they desperately battle for survival again.The Perth side, who dodged the play-off spot last term, are five points adrift at the bottom with five games left.Speaking before Saturday's trip to Motherwell, Clark said: "There are still a few boys here that experienced last year when we were in it right down until the last day at Motherwell funnily enough and we can use that for ourselves, we can use that to help the boys that maybe haven't been in this situation before to get through this."They know what it is like themselves, we don't need to tell them how important it is, not just the football side of things, it is the people that nobody really sees or hears about, the people that work their backsides off behind the scenes up the stairs and keep the club running."So it affects everything if you don't stay in this league. We know what it is going to take and we are going to give absolutely everything to get us out of the situation."The Premiership table may not make pretty reading for St Johnstone but Clark insists they have shown enough this season to suggest they can get out of trouble.He said: "At one point we thought we were dead and buried, I think we were maybe eight, nine even 10 points adrift and we showed what we were all about, we got back into it slightly."I know we are still five behind but we have shown we can put results together, we can perform to earn those results and we are more than capable of doing that."We have more than enough experience and quality in that dressing room to get out of it."Saints take goalkeeper on trial - gossippublished at 07:52 23 April07:52 23 AprilImage source, BBC SportSt Johnstone have given a trial to 19-year-old goalkeeper Nathaniel Nwosu, who has been capped by Nigeria.

I just can't see the same desire or fire in the belly, which may be the current side's downfall.As always, I love nothing more than being proved wrong and if we can gather some momentum, starting away to Motherwell on Saturday, then we can look forward to an absolute rollercoaster last month of the campaign.There may not be trophies up for grabs any more but celebrating survival would be up there with some of the great achievements this wonderful club has produced over the past 20 years.Sam Miller can be found at Dogger Saints, externalIkpeazu reveals five operation nightmare - gossippublished at 08:43 22 April08:43 22 AprilSt Johnstone striker Uche Ikpeazu, the 30-year-old who made a 15-minute cameo appearance in Sunday's Scottish Cup semi-final defeat by Celtic, has revealed that it was not until after a fifth operation to his knee that he started to see light at the end of a near season-long absence.

The nature of the split means each team in the bottom half will face the other before the end of the campaign, so there is scope for points-per-game averages to fluctuate.And what does all of this mean for St Johnstone? Well, the 33 points Simo Valakari's side are projected to finish on would be the highest for a bottom-placed team in the Premiership since 2017.That would be no consolation for the Perth club if they go down, but that is certainly not guaranteed to happen just yet.However, they have a real fight on their hands to make up a five-point gap while improving their inferior goal difference.'How many times do we create our own issues?'published at 11:44 21 April11:44 21 AprilWe asked for your views on St Johnstone's heavy five-goal defeat against Celtic in the Scottish Cup semi-finals at Hampden.Here's what some of you said:Les: This was always a free hit for us and the first 30 minutes was okay. But we imploded in 12 minutes before half time. The goals conceded were all avoidable. Yet again individual errors cost us. It's been the same all season. We at least stuck at it second half, but the five games remaining are the priority now. We absolutely have to win the three home games and being honest I think that is beyond this group. The Championship beckons.Ron: Whatever happens we must stick with this manager for next season.Ian: After the win at home against them a scudding was expected and a scudding was duly delivered. The frustration for me is the cheap and meek manner in which the goals were conceded. That said they put six past Aberdeen in the League Cup semis and I wouldn't swap the three league points we got for a cup final. We've got five cup finals to go.Dave: How many times do we create our own issues playing silly, nothing balls forward from the back into the middle of the park? Is it the players who have to take responsibility or Simo Valakari? I really like Simo, but something has to change with that aspect as it's happening all too often and we've lost several goals from these mistakes since he's arrived. It was always going to be hard, but that made it impossible and we lost our belief as soon as that first goal went in.19:59 20 April'Dream was already gone' - Valakari on St Johnstone's half-time focus shift , published at 19:59 20 April'Dream was already gone' - Valakari on St Johnstone's half-time focus shift AttributionSt JohnstoneSt Johnstone 0-5 Celtic: Have your saypublished at 18:18 20 April18:18 20 AprilSt Johnstone fans, what did you make of your side's performance as their Scottish Cup journey ended at Hampden against holders Celtic?
