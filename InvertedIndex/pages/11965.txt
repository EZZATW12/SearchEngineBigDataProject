"We are disappointed we didn't win the game, with the number of chances we had and we score two very good goals as well," he tells BBC Scotland. "That perhaps shows how far we've come."We played some terrific football as well. If you look at the disparity of the resources of the two football clubs, there weren't many people who could have told the difference today."Image source, SNS344Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingCounty 'won't hide' after latest defeat - Cowiepublished at 17:52 British Summer Time 26 April17:52 BST 26 AprilFT: KIlmarnock 2-0 Ross CountyRoss County manager Don Cowie tells BBC Scotland: "Overall, probably, yeah [it was a fair result]."I don't think there was much in the first half at all. One moment of quality from Danny Armstrong puts in a great ball into the box, and they score from it, and that was the difference. "In these games, that's really important, getting that first goal, then allows Kilmarnock to play with that bit of confidence, bit of freedom."So, really disappointed because we spoke all week about how important it was to try and get that first goal. "We won't hide away from it. We're disappointed with the run of form that we're in. So we know where we are. We've got four games left, it's a case of not feeling sorry for ourselves.  "It'll hurt right now. Long journey up the road, a lot of time to reflect on the game, which I'll do, and then it's making sure that on Monday that we are ready for a massive game against Hearts. "We're at home, we've got to be ready for it, and it's still in our hands."Image source, SNS62Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingMcInnes hails 'efficient and professional' winpublished at 17:49 British Summer Time 26 April17:49 BST 26 AprilFT: Kilmarnock 2-0 Ross CountyKilmarnock manager Derek McInnes tells BBC Scotland his side put in a much-needed "efficient and professional" performance as they eased past Ross County.“Who knows [how important the win will be]," he said. "But it was just important for us to bounce back after our disappointment at Celtic Park. It was a tough afternoon, you’re never truly judged on those games, but we are judged on these.“In the last two games, Motherwell and Ross County, [we were] quite similar, we weren't enthralling or too exciting it but it was efficient, professional, and got the job done with two cleansheets and 2-0 [in both games].“The first goal is a great goal with a lovely stood-up cross from Danny Armstrong and Bruce Anderson finding space amongst all the size. He’s the smallest player in the box, and he finds that space, which he’s always done. A great goal.“In the second half, we wanted to keep that momentum going. We were pretty steady with our work. The second goal comes from Liam Donnelly, I thought he was our best player today - a real responsibility and presence in the middle of the park and lovely quality for the second goal.”Image source, SNSImage caption, Kilmarnock goalscorers Liam Donnelly (left) and Bruce Anderson52Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingHibs still have 'brilliant opportunity' - Graypublished at 17:45 British Summer Time 26 April17:45 BST 26 AprilFT: Aberdeen 1-0 HibernianHibernian head coach David Gray: "It's obviously a feeling we've not had for a very long time. It's never nice when it comes around. I certainly don't enjoy the feeling, none of the players do."Did we do enough to win it? Probably not. But the players gave me everything. Kevin Nisbet scored a fantastic goal that separated the two sides. We created enough chances without being clinical within that."It certainly makes it tighter. We're still sitting in third position with four games to go. We've given ourselves a brilliant opportunity. It is about the reaction now, you can't dwell on this result, this performance.

It's difficult to win the match when you concede three goals."It's hard to criticise my players though, they put in everything."There was a lot of good performances. Yes, the result was not what we were hoping but next home match we don't have any other choice than to win."When you change your backline you lose the connection between the players. "The only medicine for this is to win the next game."We need some other results to go our way now too. At the same time, we can only do what we can do and we need to start winning football matches."The boys want to do well but unfortunately we get no points.

More important was that we came back from going 1-0 down very well."The game from minute 20 to minute 45 was how I want to see us play, to think forward and to play forward. We stayed calm and we deserved the two goals."We also have to speak about the goals we conceded because it was too easy."I spoke a lot with Tony Watt and told him he has to keep going and he'll get his chance. This was the Tony I want to see.

You saw a team with a real team ethic there."We executed that game plan to the letter and I couldn't be more proud of them, putting in that level of performance. It's been a tough two weeks, we let our standards drop against Hibs."Hearts have got excellent players, and they kept changing and trying to find the answers. But we limited them and as the game went on, they crossed from deeper and we became more comfortable."We've faced a lot of adversity through injuries, Joe Shaughnessy has missed 31 games for me this season.

They weren't brilliant by any means but impressed in the way that once ahead, it was them who showed the desire to finish the job.That's crucial in these pressure games and stands them in good stead for the run-in, with a trip to beleaguered St Johnstone next.For Ross County, they will be desperate to avoid another play-off finish. There's only so many times you can dance with the devil before you get burned. Five defeats on the trot is not the sort of form you want at this stage of  the season.  With Hearts visiting next, they simply have to arrest this run.Image source, SNSImage caption, Liam Donnelly (left) celebrates with Daniel Armstrong after scoring to make it 2-033Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingPostpublished at 17:21 British Summer Time 26 April17:21 BST 26 AprilFT: St Mirren 2-2 RangersBarry Ferguson has four wins from 11 games in charge of Rangers now.The interim boss sounds very glum in his BBC interview.

As a drab contest entered its final stages, Scotland striker Nisbet controlled a Graeme Shinnie cross on his chest, before arcing a dipping volley over goalkeeper Jordan Smith and high into the Hibs net.It earned Scottish Cup finalists Aberdeen a first win over Hibs this season and moves them level on points with their visitors with four games remaining.David Gray's side do retain a significant goal difference advantage and carried plenty of threat at Pittodrie.Martin Boyle shot just past a post early on after Aberdeen had played themselves into trouble, and Josh Campbell and Rocky Bushiri went close, too.Bushiri played his part at the other end, blocking efforts from Pape Habib Gueye and Topi Keskinen.But the fact neither goalkeeper had a significant save of note to make tells the story of a frustrating opening 45 minutes.Hibs were quick out of the traps in the second half, Campbell and Bushiri again going close with headers. But it was Aberdeen who had the ball in the net on 68 minutes, only for Nisbet's effort to be ruled offside.The striekr wasn't to be denied, though, and broke the deadlock with a genuine goal of the season contender.Aberdeen had a spring in their step after that and almost doubled their lead in added time when substitute Oday Dabbagh burst through but was denied by Smith.Smith was called into action again to parry a Dante Polvara shot as Jimmy Thelin's secured a win which moves them up to fourth and on to the coattails of Hibs.Aberdeen timing run right?While much has been made of Hibs' incredible run of form, Aberdeen appear to be coming good again at just the right time.They have put the turbos on at the business end of the season - it is now just one defeat in 12 games in all competitions for Thelin's side.While all things Europe remain undecided, what now appears clear is that the battle for those places – and for who will finish as the best of the rest of behind the Old Firm – looks set to go down to the wire.Aberdeen are very much in the thick of it and are showing plenty of character at the moment – and character, as well as quality, can get you over the line.They also have a Scottish Cup final to look forward to at the end of May, and the potential impact of that on their league form perhaps shouldn't be underestimated.Every player in the Pittodrie dressing room will want to be part of the squad for Hampden. In order to do that, they will have to perform well between now and then.Could that give Aberdeen the edge in the chase for third?How will Hibs respond to setback?This will be a reminder to Hibs that there is still plenty of work to do between now and the end of the season.David Gray's side remain third, but are now embroiled in what is shaping up to be a real dogfight, with Dundee United also still in the conversation.All good things come to end at some point and this result ends their remarkable unbeaten run in the top division. What will be fascinating is how they react.You have to go all the way back to 7 December for the last time they emerged empty handed from a Premiership outing.But this group of players have proven – after a wobbly start to the campaign – that they have the ability to bounce back, having looked like relegation fodder right up until December.What they saidAberdeen manager Jimmy Thelin: "It was a really intense and difficult game. The performance was stable and in some areas really good. It was really important for us to get the three points."We knew before this that we had to win this game because they were three points before us. The last four in the league now is still so tight. We have to be sharp in every game that's left."Hibernian head coach David Gray: "Did we do enough to win it? Probably not. The players gave me everything. We created enough chances without being clinical."It certainly makes it tighter and all to play for moving forward. We're still currently sitting in third position with four games to go. We've given ourselves a brilliant opportunity. It's certainly all to play for for everyone."Related topicsAberdeenScottish PremiershipFootballHibernianScottish Premiership Scores & FixturesSaturday 26th AprilHearts 0 , Dundee 1 at Full timeHeartsHeartsHearts01DundeeDundeeDundeeFull timeFTKilmarnock 2 , Ross County 0 at Full timeKilmarnockKilmarnockKilmarnock20Ross CountyRoss CountyRoss CountyFull timeFTMotherwell 3 , St. Johnstone 2 at Full timeMotherwellMotherwellMotherwell32St. JohnstoneSt. JohnstoneSt. JohnstoneFull timeFTDundee United 0 , Celtic 5 at Full timeDundee UtdDundee UnitedDundee United05CelticCelticCelticFull timeFTAberdeen 1 , Hibernian 0 at Full timeAberdeenAberdeenAberdeen10HibernianHibernianHibernianFull timeFTSt. Mirren 2 , Rangers 2 at Full timeSt. MirrenSt. MirrenSt. Mirren22RangersRangersRangersFull timeFTView all Scottish Premiership fixturesScottish Premiership TableOn Saturday 26th AprilSkip to table keyMatch Participants:Hibernian, Position 3, Points 53Aberdeen, Position 4, Points 532nd Phase Championship GroupTeamPlayedWonDrawnLostGoals ForGoals AgainstGoal DifferencePointsForm, Last 6 games, Oldest first1Celtic342734102228084No ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultWResult Win2Rangers34207770373367No ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultDResult Draw3Hibernian341411954421253No ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultLResult Loss4Aberdeen34158114649-353No ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultWResult Win5Dundee United34148124145-450No ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultLResult Loss6St. Mirren34126164756-942No ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultDResult DrawView latest Scottish Premiership table2nd Phase Relegation GroupTeamPlayedWonDrawnLostGoals ForGoals AgainstGoal DifferencePointsForm, Last 6 games, Oldest first1Motherwell34126164058-1842No ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultWResult Win2Hearts34117164345-240No ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultLResult Loss3Kilmarnock34108164058-1838No ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultWResult Win4Dundee34107175171-2037No ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultWResult Win5Ross County3498173358-2535No ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultLResult Loss6St. Johnstone3485213561-2629No ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultLResult LossView latest Scottish Premiership tableMatch Participants:Hibernian, Position 3, Points 53Aberdeen, Position 5, Points 50TeamPlayedWonDrawnLostGoals ForGoals AgainstGoal DifferencePointsForm, Last 6 games, Oldest first1Celtic33263497227581WResult WinWResult WinLResult LossWResult WinLResult LossWResult Win2Rangers33206768353366WResult WinLResult LossWResult WinWResult WinLResult LossDResult Draw3Hibernian331411854411353WResult WinWResult WinDResult DrawWResult WinWResult WinWResult Win4Dundee United33148114140150LResult LossDResult DrawLResult LossWResult WinWResult WinWResult Win5Aberdeen33148114549-450LResult LossDResult DrawDResult DrawWResult WinWResult WinDResult Draw6St. Mirren33125164554-941LResult LossLResult LossDResult DrawWResult WinLResult LossWResult Win7Hearts33117154344-140WResult WinLResult LossWResult WinLResult LossLResult LossDResult Draw8Motherwell33116163756-1939WResult WinWResult WinDResult DrawLResult LossLResult LossDResult Draw9Kilmarnock3398163858-2035LResult LossLResult LossDResult DrawLResult LossWResult WinLResult Loss10Ross County3398163356-2335LResult LossWResult WinLResult LossLResult LossLResult LossLResult Loss11Dundee3397175071-2134LResult LossDResult DrawWResult WinLResult LossWResult WinLResult Loss12St. Johnstone3385203358-2529WResult WinDResult DrawDResult DrawLResult LossWResult WinLResult LossView latest Scottish Premiership tableKeyPosition 1 - 2 : UEFA Champions League QualifiersPosition 3 : UEFA Europa League QualifiersPosition 4 : UEFA Conference League QualifiersLast Updated 26th April 2025 at 18:12Please Note: All times UK.
