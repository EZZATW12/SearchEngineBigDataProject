"We are disappointed we didn't win the game, with the number of chances we had and we score two very good goals as well," he tells BBC Scotland. "That perhaps shows how far we've come."We played some terrific football as well. If you look at the disparity of the resources of the two football clubs, there weren't many people who could have told the difference today."Image source, SNS344Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingCounty 'won't hide' after latest defeat - Cowiepublished at 17:52 British Summer Time 26 April17:52 BST 26 AprilFT: KIlmarnock 2-0 Ross CountyRoss County manager Don Cowie tells BBC Scotland: "Overall, probably, yeah [it was a fair result]."I don't think there was much in the first half at all. One moment of quality from Danny Armstrong puts in a great ball into the box, and they score from it, and that was the difference. "In these games, that's really important, getting that first goal, then allows Kilmarnock to play with that bit of confidence, bit of freedom."So, really disappointed because we spoke all week about how important it was to try and get that first goal. "We won't hide away from it. We're disappointed with the run of form that we're in. So we know where we are. We've got four games left, it's a case of not feeling sorry for ourselves.  "It'll hurt right now. Long journey up the road, a lot of time to reflect on the game, which I'll do, and then it's making sure that on Monday that we are ready for a massive game against Hearts. "We're at home, we've got to be ready for it, and it's still in our hands."Image source, SNS62Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingMcInnes hails 'efficient and professional' winpublished at 17:49 British Summer Time 26 April17:49 BST 26 AprilFT: Kilmarnock 2-0 Ross CountyKilmarnock manager Derek McInnes tells BBC Scotland his side put in a much-needed "efficient and professional" performance as they eased past Ross County.“Who knows [how important the win will be]," he said. "But it was just important for us to bounce back after our disappointment at Celtic Park. It was a tough afternoon, you’re never truly judged on those games, but we are judged on these.“In the last two games, Motherwell and Ross County, [we were] quite similar, we weren't enthralling or too exciting it but it was efficient, professional, and got the job done with two cleansheets and 2-0 [in both games].“The first goal is a great goal with a lovely stood-up cross from Danny Armstrong and Bruce Anderson finding space amongst all the size. He’s the smallest player in the box, and he finds that space, which he’s always done. A great goal.“In the second half, we wanted to keep that momentum going. We were pretty steady with our work. The second goal comes from Liam Donnelly, I thought he was our best player today - a real responsibility and presence in the middle of the park and lovely quality for the second goal.”Image source, SNSImage caption, Kilmarnock goalscorers Liam Donnelly (left) and Bruce Anderson52Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingHibs still have 'brilliant opportunity' - Graypublished at 17:45 British Summer Time 26 April17:45 BST 26 AprilFT: Aberdeen 1-0 HibernianHibernian head coach David Gray: "It's obviously a feeling we've not had for a very long time. It's never nice when it comes around. I certainly don't enjoy the feeling, none of the players do."Did we do enough to win it? Probably not. But the players gave me everything. Kevin Nisbet scored a fantastic goal that separated the two sides. We created enough chances without being clinical within that."It certainly makes it tighter. We're still sitting in third position with four games to go. We've given ourselves a brilliant opportunity. It is about the reaction now, you can't dwell on this result, this performance.

Yes, the result was not what we were hoping but next home match we don't have any other choice than to win."When you change your backline you lose the connection between the players. "The only medicine for this is to win the next game."We need some other results to go our way now too. At the same time, we can only do what we can do and we need to start winning football matches."The boys want to do well but unfortunately we get no points.

You saw a team with a real team ethic there."We executed that game plan to the letter and I couldn't be more proud of them, putting in that level of performance. It's been a tough two weeks, we let our standards drop against Hibs."Hearts have got excellent players, and they kept changing and trying to find the answers. But we limited them and as the game went on, they crossed from deeper and we became more comfortable."We've faced a lot of adversity through injuries, Joe Shaughnessy has missed 31 games for me this season.

They weren't brilliant by any means but impressed in the way that once ahead, it was them who showed the desire to finish the job.That's crucial in these pressure games and stands them in good stead for the run-in, with a trip to beleaguered St Johnstone next.For Ross County, they will be desperate to avoid another play-off finish. There's only so many times you can dance with the devil before you get burned. Five defeats on the trot is not the sort of form you want at this stage of  the season.  With Hearts visiting next, they simply have to arrest this run.Image source, SNSImage caption, Liam Donnelly (left) celebrates with Daniel Armstrong after scoring to make it 2-033Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingPostpublished at 17:21 British Summer Time 26 April17:21 BST 26 AprilFT: St Mirren 2-2 RangersBarry Ferguson has four wins from 11 games in charge of Rangers now.The interim boss sounds very glum in his BBC interview.

First Callum Slattery slid in an equaliser before Johnny Koutroumbis' effort was deflected into his own goal by Sven Sprangler.The reinvigorated hosts added a third shortly after half time, Tom Sparrow volleying home.And, although the deficit was reduced when substitute Elliot Watt's 25-yard-effort found a way beyond Ellery Balcombe, Motherwell held on to claim all three points and move above Hearts into seventh place.St Johnstone had started confidently despite their league position and took an early lead when Josh McPake took advantage of slack defending and cut back for Kirk to slam high into the net.Motherwell changed their system to a 4-2-3-1 and slowly started to take control. That said, it took until the half hour to test Andy Fisher, who looked smart in pushing Harry Paton's effort away.Shortly after that, Michael Wimmer's side were level with almost a carbon copy of St Johnstone's opener. Tony Watt found himself free and his cut back found Slattery, who passed it low into the net.Watt was involved almost immediately after the restart, crossing for Koutroumbis to hammer home via a deflection.There was a renewed vigour about Motherwell in the second half, and they went 3-1 ahead when Sparrow volleyed in after tenacious play from Dom Thompson.St Johnstone rallied and Watt pulled a goal back with 25 minutes to play. That led to a nervy finale but the visitors were unable to create any clear cut chances and Motherwell held on.Watt shines as Motherwell take pointsMotherwell came into the match without a win since 1 March, and there was concern they could become embroiled in a relegation battle. However, a small change to Wimmer's preferred system paid rewards here.Watt, a peripheral figure in recent times, was crucial to everything Motherwell did. St Johnstone found his movement difficult to deal with, and he was involved in both of his side's goals in the first half. He was close to adding one of his own later, too.That all adds up to an important three points, which leaves Motherwell 13 points ahead of bottom-placed St Johnstone with just four games to play.Relegation looks likely for St Johnstone At one point on Saturday, St Johnstone were just two points behind Dundee in the live table. But the turnaround at Fir Park, coupled with results elsewhere, means they are now six points behind second bottom Ross County.This game was the season in microcosm for Valakari's side. Tey played some nice stuff, went ahead, and looking comfortable after 35 minutes. But, like last weekend's semi-final, the 10 minutes before the break proved crucial.Escaping relegation isn't yet impossible, but it looks increasingly unlikely.What they saidMotherwell manager Michael Wimmer: "I feel good, it was a very important win."Very good to get the feeling back to celebrate after the whistle. More important was that we came back from going 1-0 down very well."The game from minute 20 to minute 45 was how I want to see us play, to think forward and to play forward. We stayed calm and we deserved the two goals.St Johnstone head coach Simo Valakari: "It was a tough afternoon. It's difficult to win the match when you concede three goals."It's hard to criticise my players though, they put in everything."There was a lot of good performances.
