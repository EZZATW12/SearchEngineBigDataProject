More affordable. And venues need to be re-used. Athletes hosted in empty university accommodations."Diver Grace Reid, a two-time Commonwealth gold medallist, agrees change is the right approach."In this day and age, sport has to diversify to match the climate," the 28-year-old said, speaking before her sport missed the cut for Glasgow 2026."We have to think about the athletes but we have to think about the countries that have to fund them."Gilmour has concerns about the short time frame to organise a Games."I just really hope that we have enough time to build that atmosphere and anticipation for the athletes and fans," she said."I've got no doubt Commonwealth Games Scotland and the Commonwealth Games Federation will do absolutely everything in their power to make it spectacular."They have to organise logistics, venues, personnel, transport etc. I'm hopeful but it's a tough task."The question of legacyImage source, SNSImage caption, Murdoch was a surprise gold medallist in the 200m breaststroke in 2014From a sporting perspective, McColgan thinks the Commonwealth Games play a "really important" role for young Scottish athletes.The 33-year-old said the event provides an opportunity for them to compete on a lesser stage than the world events while finding their way."It bridges the gap and gives athletes the opportunity to experience a multi-event Games before [hopefully] representing Team GB at a global championships," McColgan explained. "It's a great pathway."Swimmer Ross Murdoch, a breakthrough star in 2014, agreed the Games are an important "stepping stone"."The Commonwealth Games was the real start to my career," he said."It's not a pointless meet on the way to the Olympics. It's an opportunity to preserve something that allows athletes to grow towards something they might never have thought they could achieve."Wightman, meanwhile, added that children can take inspiration from seeing compatriots compete at home."It would be great to keep this moment rolling in Scottish athletics and Scottish sport," he said. "Another generation can be inspired."Reid believes the benefits are wider than purely sporting.She said: "They are incredibly important for all those young kids that get to watch some incredible sport and all the benefits that brings to Glasgow - it could be a really exciting prospect."Related topicsCommonwealth GamesTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9063 viewing9.1k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished5 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Scottish sportWhat is still to be decided as season reaches climax?League reconstruction - why, when & what might it look like?Scotland men's internationals to be shown live on BBCCommonwealth Games: Why is it so special to be part of Team Scotland?From titles to tinpottery - rank Scotland's top 10 clubsElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
