I don't think it helps that the other game plays before us, although in this instance it worked in our favour because we knew the [Coventry] result."It's certainly not the best we have played. We know we can play better and we will need to play better next week if we want to try to give ourselves an opportunity."But what we do have is, we are always in every game, we give it everything we have got."I am really proud of the players for their efforts this season, but we have still got one to go."Swansea caretaker head coach Alan Sheehan:"There's ways to win and ways to lose. If you are going to lose, you want to lose attacking until the very end and that's what we did."In the first half we didn't control the madness as well as we could have done. But in the second half we made a few tactical tweaks and I thought we were really good."We did everything apart from score. On another day you walk away with one or three points, but we just lacked that cutting edge in the final third."I am happy that we went to the final whistle but obviously disappointed we didn't find the net on a number of occasions in the second half."Related topicsFootballComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 180Championship Scores & FixturesSaturday 26th AprilLuton Town 1 , Coventry City 0 at Full timeLutonLuton TownLuton Town10CoventryCoventry CityCoventry CityFull timeFTQueens Park Rangers 0 , Burnley 5 at Full timeQPRQueens Park RangersQueens Park Rangers05BurnleyBurnleyBurnleyFull timeFTBlackburn Rovers 2 , Watford 1 at Full timeBlackburnBlackburn RoversBlackburn Rovers21WatfordWatfordWatfordFull timeFTCardiff City 0 , West Bromwich Albion 0 at Full timeCardiffCardiff CityCardiff City00West BromWest Bromwich AlbionWest Bromwich AlbionFull timeFTHull City 0 , Derby County 1 at Full timeHullHull CityHull City01DerbyDerby CountyDerby CountyFull timeFTMiddlesbrough 0 , Norwich City 0 at Full timeMiddlesbroughMiddlesbroughMiddlesbrough00NorwichNorwich CityNorwich CityFull timeFTMillwall 1 , Swansea City 0 at Full timeMillwallMillwallMillwall10SwanseaSwansea CitySwansea CityFull timeFTOxford United 2 , Sunderland 0 at Full timeOxfordOxford UnitedOxford United20SunderlandSunderlandSunderlandFull timeFTPreston North End 1 , Plymouth Argyle 2 at Full timePrestonPreston North EndPreston North End12PlymouthPlymouth ArgylePlymouth ArgyleFull timeFTSheffield Wednesday 1 , Portsmouth 1 at Full timeSheff WedSheffield WednesdaySheffield Wednesday11PortsmouthPortsmouthPortsmouthFull timeFTView all Championship fixturesChampionship TableOn Saturday 26th AprilSkip to table keyMatch Participants:Millwall, Position 7, Points 66Swansea City, Position 11, Points 60TeamPlayedWonDrawnLostGoals ForGoals AgainstGoal DifferencePointsForm, Last 6 games, Oldest first1Burnley452716266155197WResult WinDResult DrawWResult WinWResult WinWResult WinWResult Win2Leeds United442713489296094DResult DrawDResult DrawWResult WinWResult WinWResult WinWResult Win3Sheffield United452871062352789LResult LossLResult LossLResult LossWResult WinLResult LossWResult Win4Sunderland4521131158431576WResult WinDResult DrawLResult LossLResult LossLResult LossLResult Loss5Bristol City441716115749867LResult LossWResult WinWResult WinDResult DrawWResult WinLResult Loss6Coventry City45199176258466LResult LossWResult WinDResult DrawWResult WinLResult LossLResult Loss7Millwall451812154646066WResult WinWResult WinWResult WinLResult LossWResult WinWResult Win8Blackburn Rovers45198185247565LResult LossDResult DrawWResult WinWResult WinWResult WinWResult Win9Middlesbrough4518101764541064WResult WinLResult LossLResult LossWResult WinLResult LossDResult Draw10West Bromwich Albion451419125244861LResult LossLResult LossWResult WinLResult LossLResult LossDResult Draw11Swansea City45179194853-560WResult WinWResult WinWResult WinWResult WinWResult WinLResult Loss12Sheffield Wednesday451512185968-957LResult LossDResult DrawLResult LossLResult LossWResult WinDResult Draw13Watford45168215260-856LResult LossWResult WinLResult LossLResult LossLResult LossLResult Loss14Norwich City451315176766154LResult LossDResult DrawLResult LossLResult LossLResult LossDResult Draw15Queens Park Rangers451314185263-1153DResult DrawWResult WinDResult DrawWResult WinLResult LossLResult Loss16Portsmouth451411205770-1353LResult LossLResult LossDResult DrawWResult WinWResult WinDResult Draw17Oxford United451313194662-1652WResult WinLResult LossWResult WinLResult LossDResult DrawWResult Win18Stoke City451214194562-1750DResult DrawDResult DrawWResult WinWResult WinLResult LossLResult Loss19Derby County451310224856-849LResult LossDResult DrawDResult DrawLResult LossWResult WinWResult Win20Preston North End451019164657-1149DResult DrawDResult DrawLResult LossLResult LossLResult LossLResult Loss21Luton Town451310224264-2249DResult DrawDResult DrawLResult LossWResult WinWResult WinWResult Win22Hull City451212214353-1048WResult WinLResult LossDResult DrawLResult LossWResult WinLResult Loss23Plymouth Argyle451113215086-3646WResult WinLResult LossWResult WinLResult LossWResult WinWResult Win24Cardiff City45917194669-2344DResult DrawDResult DrawLResult LossLResult LossDResult DrawDResult DrawView latest Championship tableKeyPosition 1 - 2 : PromotionPosition 3 - 6 : Promotion Play-offPosition 22 - 24 : RelegationSheffield United have been deducted two points for defaulted transfer payments.Last Updated 26th April 2025 at 17:01Please Note: All times UK.
