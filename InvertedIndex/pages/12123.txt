But we remain very positive that we will get there."When asked if there was a new deadline, Tierney replied: "No. We've been quite public we do need to refinance in order to build a sustainable future and to be able to take on the club's debt."We can't refinance under the current PRA, so we need to move. That's the thing that's driving the deadline."I want to give the clubs certainty for next season in terms of the money they've got to spend on players. We are getting very close to that."So, we need to do it imminently but we are not giving arbitrary deadlines as part of that."Injured Tipuric to miss Ospreys home farewellPublished3 days agoQueensland Reds lock Smith to join Ospreys for next seasonPublished4 days agoWales and Lions lock Beard to leave OspreysPublished4 days agoMalcolm Wall, the chair of the Professional Rugby Board and a WRU board member, expects the document to be signed."We were very close to signing and then we had the Cardiff news," Wall told BBC Scrum V live."We have had lengthy meetings to explain that process and that setback and we expect that to be signed. I, like a lot of other people, have put a huge amount of effort into this and I am convinced it will be signed."The financial aspect is that money will go up by £2m in two years' time and the debts will be removed. The WRU will fund those clubs over £6m a season and this is a considerable amount of funding and I think this is a big step."Wall accepted there is still much to resolve after the WRU named Dave Reddin as the new director of rugby."We have to be radical in the way we do things," Wall added."Let's be honest, we are in a very poor position and there is still lots to do."Cardiff news was 'sad day for Welsh rugby'Scarlets managing director Jon Daniels said the two parties were "genuinely committed to working together for a better future for Welsh rugby"."We all still want to get there," Daniels told the Scarlets website. "We are more collaborative than we have been in past, although we don't agree on everything."Meaningful conversations are still ongoing and we are positive we'll come to a final agreement in the near future."We have to get to a place we are all happy to sign and commit to – including those who are providing associated funding along with the WRU."Daniels added the Cardiff situation has reminded Welsh rugby of how much it relies on benefactors."The news from Cardiff was a sad day across Welsh rugby, with the stress and uncertainty it brought as well as the stark reminder to those across the professional game of the challenges we all face," said Daniels."The Cardiff situation is a harsh reminder of our reliance on a small group of funding directors who still commit their own money to support us – some of whom have done so for two decades.  "We are fortunate to have their continued backing as well as their unrivalled knowledge and experience of the game in Wales."Ospreys chief executive Lance Bradley's position is that "they are in a good place but a few details we need to sort out"."The Cardiff situation was a bit of a bump in the road but that's all it is," said Bradley. "I am still confident it will be ok."Waiting gameImage source, Huw Evans Picture AgencyImage caption, Ospreys head coach Mark Jones is a former Wales wingOspreys head coach Mark Jones says he is waiting on the new deal before final budgets for next season are confirmed.Ospreys have signed Queensland Reds lock Ryan Smith as a replacement for outgoing Wales second-row Adam Beard.Flanker Ross Moriarty is also set to join from Brive, while Cardiff hooker Efan Daniel is in their sights.Wales captains Jac Morgan and Dewi Lake have also signed contracts to keep them in Swansea for at least another season.While most of next season's transfer business has been completed, Jones is waiting on any more funds that can be provided for bonus signings."We have got a couple of signings we still have sitting there to announce at some point," said Jones."We are waiting to hear on the financials at the moment from the WRU and the agreement."Myself, the coaches and Dan Griffiths (Ospreys head of recruitment) have an idea of where we would like to strengthen the squad, but with the varying bottom line on finances, we have to prioritise."The first thing we have to do is retain our own players and then replace people who are going out the door. Then we have to try and add quality and depth to the squad."We don't know what we can do at the moment because of the financial security. If we get the go-ahead to grow depth and bring quality in, hopefully we can do that if the budget allows."
