Michael said."You have the hope and the dream that one day you could be in the Football League or even higher and, once you make the decision to switch, you can never reverse it. I think that's the main factor that was on the owners' minds."More than 3,000 fans were at Penydarren Park to see Merthyr seal promotion with a 3-0 victory over Hungerford Town.They have lost only four of their 41 league games this season, registering 27 wins and scoring 105 goals.Michael says Merthyr "have the support base" to make further progress.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Party time at Merthyr as Martyrs clinch promotion"I looked at the average attendances at the bottom of League Two and some clubs are getting just over 2,000 - Newport County's average is 4,000," he told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast."I honestly think a club in the [Welsh] valleys could bring that kind of crowd in, so who knows? But we need investment and we need sponsorship to continue. We are fan-owned and we don't have an investor pumping in millions to take us [forward] like Wrexham have had over the last few years."We can go as far as people in the community want us to go I guess, by getting behind us."As Merthyr wait to discover which division they will go into next season, Michael says his side can expect significant challenges in either National League North or South.But he added: "We have a fantastic group of players and hopefully, next season, we don't think we are going to be daunted by the challenge."We are looking forward to going and having a go at the next tier up."Merthyr battled back to regain their Southern League status following liquidation in 2010.As Merthyr Tydfil FC they competed in the fifth tier of the English system as recently as the 1990s, but their only spell as a Football League club came prior to World War Two.Related topicsWelsh FootballWales SportFootballTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8275 viewing8.3k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished6 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
