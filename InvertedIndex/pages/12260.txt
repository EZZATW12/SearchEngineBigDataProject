"This is stuff of dreams - I finally got my opportunity and what a time to show it in front of all of these people. This has been a long time coming because I have dedicated my whole life to the sport."It is a second successive defeat for Smith, 36, after losing to Eubank in September 2023."Going into this fight, a lot of big people in boxing predicted me to lose and thought I couldn't outbox Liam but I showed I could," added McKenna. "I had a very good camp and my mindset is very strong."I genuinely do believe I am the best fighter in the world in the middleweight division and I keep proving it fight after fight. It's about time people start taking notice."Related topicsNorthern Ireland SportBoxingBoxing schedule and results 2025Published1 day agoWatch every Born to Brawl episodePublished28 April 2024More boxing from the BBCNotifications, social media and more with BBC SportPublished31 JanuaryTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8851 viewing8.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Northern Ireland sportThe 'rugby student' stepping up to lead IrelandPre-contract agreements - why are they different in NI?Record-breaker Dunlop 'breaks mould' of modern sporting heroesMeet Jude McAtamney - the New York Giants kicker from Derry Elsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
