However, the visitors dominated the second half and Jordan Hendrikse's late penalty gave the Sharks the win."The first half hour we we cooking and it felt great," Stockdale told BBC Sport NI."We let them back into the game a bit too much and let them play their power game. In fairness to them, they took their chances really well."Ulster's play-off hopes dented with loss to SharksPublished1 day agoStockdale, who was named player of the match after impressing at full-back despite a first-half yellow card, said it was a "disappointing one" to let the game slip away.The defeat leaves Ulster in 12th position in the United Rugby Championship with two matches remaining.The top eight qualify for the play-offs and while Richie Murphy's side are just three points off securing knockout rugby, they will likely need victories away to challengers Munster and Edinburgh."It's a disappointing one and I suppose that's representative of the season we've had, where there's a lot of really promising stuff but we haven't quite been able to get across the line," admitted Stockdale."We've still got a couple of games left to squeeze into the play-offs. I think we still can, so our focus has to shift to that now." Stockdale, who said he "loved the freedom" of playing at full-back instead of his traditional wing position, said he was "gutted" Ulster could not win in the final home match for eight players who will leave the province at the end of the season.One of those is captain Alan O'Connor, who Stockdale said was "one of the best leaders who has ever graced" Ulster's Ravenhill home."I don't say that lightly. He's an incredibly humble fella and he brings the best version of himself every single day into Ulster. "We've a couple more weeks of him, which is great, but when he moves on there are going to be some massive boots to fill."Related topicsUlsterIrish RugbyNorthern Ireland SportRugby UnionTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9934 viewing9.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished8 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Northern Ireland sportThe 'rugby student' stepping up to lead IrelandPre-contract agreements - why are they different in NI?Record-breaker Dunlop 'breaks mould' of modern sporting heroesMeet Jude McAtamney - the New York Giants kicker from Derry Elsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
