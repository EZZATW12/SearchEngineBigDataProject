It's always really tricky over in Scotland," said Fogarty."They want to finish on a high and go straight into a World Cup campaign in a good place. That has been a real focus."Fogarty added that Ireland "should be all good" in terms of fitness ahead of the game in Edinburgh, and prop Niamh O'Dowd will be available for selection after missing the win in Wales through injury.However, Fogarty said the final Six Nations game will come "a bit too soon" for wing Beibhan Parsons, who has missed the tournament through injury.Ireland ended their four-year wait for an away victory in the Six Nations in Italy earlier in the competition and backed that up with a win over Wales. Despite the bonus-point win, Fogarty says there was "a slight frustration" with a number of errors that handed Wales possession."Probably the 22 errors where we just handed the ball back to Wales. That was frustrating for us [as coaches] and equally for the players. "That shows the growth of where they are at now and they know what they can deliver on the pitch. "It's good they are like that, the players wanted to get in this week and put it right."Related topicsIrish RugbyTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9121 viewing9.1k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished8 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Northern Ireland sportThe 'rugby student' stepping up to lead IrelandPre-contract agreements - why are they different in NI?Record-breaker Dunlop 'breaks mould' of modern sporting heroesMeet Jude McAtamney - the New York Giants kicker from Derry Elsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
