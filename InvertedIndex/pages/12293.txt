In 2024, the Ballymoney rider surpassed his uncle Joey's record of Isle of Man TT wins and he admits that "took a lot of weight off my shoulders" ahead of this year. "Last year, he TT was obviously the main objective," he said."I was just a bit disappointed with the North West, obviously picking up an injury here last year hindered me. "I'm looking forward to getting to the North West and having a real good go at it. The bikes are looking well, we've a bit of work to do with the Superbike, we were left high and dry a little bit and we're working hard to get it done.
