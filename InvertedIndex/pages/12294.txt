We did get that momentum. There was my two-pointer and two more [soon] after that and you could feel the crowd getting behind us. "Listen, it's just disappointing not to win in the end."This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Highlights: Donegal secure semi-final spot with victory over MonaghanThe successive two-pointers from substitute Jack McCarron and captain Micheal Bannigan within the space of 60 seconds incredibly cut Donegal's lead to 0-16 to 0-15 as the increasingly vocal home crowd scented a famous victory.But successive scores from late inclusion Michael Langan, a largely quiet Patrick McBrearty and substitute Jamie Brennan put daylight between the sides again at 0-20 to 0-16.The Monaghan revival appeared to have been repelled when another Brennan score extended Donegal's advantage to 0-22 to 0-17 with eight minutes of normal time left.But as Fermanagh folk will attest, even a seven-point lead with that amount of time remaining is far from safe.Thus we had a frantic conclusion, which for a few moments appeared set to be laced with controversy, as a Ryan McAnespie point, which was a sniff of a goal chance, was  followed by Dessie Ward's second two-pointer of the afternoon to leave only two between the sides. As the clock ticked into the final minute, Monaghan won the subsequent kickout and managed to work the ball to Ward once again but on this occasion he pulled the far-from-easy chance wide of the post. Much as he might have liked to stall, Shaun Patton knew he had to take the kickout - lest he be blown up for time wasting - and after the ball bounced over the sideline off a Donegal fist, Monaghan's Ryan O'Toole was about to take the line ball when the hooter sounded. Thinking, Monaghan still had a final play, O'Toole found a team-mate in close proximity near halfway but at that very moment, David Coldrick's final whistle blew, quickly to be followed by protests from some Farney players.However, the Meath whistler had followed the new rulebook to the letter.New rules lead to hooter controversy at ClonesPublished20 AprilDonegal survive Monaghan comeback to reach semi-finalsPublished20 AprilUlster SFC: Donegal beat spirited Monaghan to reach last four - as it happened"The rule is that if the ball's out for a sideline and the hooter goes, it's game over," said a rueful McCarthy."It seems harsh because the rule's there that if you've a chance of build an attack or score, play should be let on. Maybe that rule needs to be looked but we can have no complaints as we missed chances before that."But while defeat was ultimately Monaghan's lot on this particular Sunday at St Tiernach's Park, McCarthy recalled regrouping from an emphatic Ulster SFC defeat by Derry two years ago to go all the way to the All-Ireland semi-finals where they gave eventual champions Dublin a tough test."We have four or five weeks to get ready for the All-Ireland series. "In 2023, we were in a similar position after being knocked out in Ulster and went on a run to reach the All-Ireland semi-finals so it's within us to make a run in the All-Ireland series."Related topicsGaelic GamesNorthern Ireland SportTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9052 viewing9.1k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Northern Ireland sportThe 'rugby student' stepping up to lead IrelandPre-contract agreements - why are they different in NI?Record-breaker Dunlop 'breaks mould' of modern sporting heroesMeet Jude McAtamney - the New York Giants kicker from Derry Elsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
