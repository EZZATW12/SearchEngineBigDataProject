The Reds' dominant era came in the 70s and 80s, with 11 titles from 1973 to 1990.All 13 of Manchester United's Premier Leagues came under the management of Sir Alex Ferguson - the first in 1993 and the 13th 20 years later in his final season.'Knocking Liverpool off their perch'In 2002, with seven Premier League titles under his belt, Ferguson appeared to be under pressure after Arsenal finished 10 points ahead of United to win the league.The Scot was asked if that was his greatest challenge."My greatest challenge is not what's happening at the moment," he said. "My greatest challenge was knocking Liverpool right off their [expletive] perch. And you can print that."Seven years later, United drew level with Liverpool's 18 league titles. They moved ahead in 2011 before Ferguson retired with them two in front.The Red Devils have not won the title since, and will finish this season in the bottom half.Liverpool secured their 19 league title when they lifted the Premier League trophy for the first time in June 2020 - their 30-year wait delayed ever so slightly by the Covid-19 pandemic.Success this year under Arne Slot moved them level with United.At the start of the 20th Century, Aston Villa were the dominant force in English football having won the league five times in seven years before Liverpool's maiden championship in 1901.Liverpool's Merseyside rivals Everton had won their first league title 10 years prior.The 1930s was a successful decade for Arsenal, with five of their 13 titles coming in that period. They have not added to their tally since their 'Invincible' 2003-04 season.Manchester City - in fourth - are now hot on their heels. Six Premier League titles in seven years propelled them to 10 overall, ahead of Everton (nine), Villa (seven), Chelsea (six), Sunderland (six), Newcastle and Sheffield Wednesday (both four).Though Liverpool and Manchester United are clear of the rest of the pack in England, they have some way to go before replicating the success of the Old Firm in Scotland.Celtic's victory over Dundee United on Saturday moved them level with Rangers on 55 league titles.More questions answered...Who runs the Premier League?
