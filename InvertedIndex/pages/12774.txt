Send us your thoughtspublished at 09:5709:57Image source, Getty ImagesWith only 72,000 in attendance for the Wembley semi-final on Sunday, we are keen to hear from you.Manager Pep Guardiola said after the game he completely understood "it's not easy" for supporters, having suggested before the match that one day the FA Cup semis could be played in the north of England.So, what do you make of Wembley semi-finals? Are fans disillusioned? Is price a deciding factor?Or is the FA Cup just not that important?Let us knowNottingham Forest 0-2 Man City - the fans' verdictpublished at 09:4409:44Image source, Getty ImagesWe asked for your thoughts after Sunday's FA Cup semi-final between Nottingham Forest and Manchester City.Here are some of your replies:Forest fansBettsy: I'm so disappointed. Let's stop giving respect to City - they aren't that good.  We seem to set up in fear of them. A dreadful performance in the first half. Danilo is awful. Poor Zach Abbott has zero idea how to play full-back but did nothing wrong apart from wanting to play centre-back. Nuno got it wrong but hopefully we now understand that to be at the top, we have to play our game and not worry about them.Fosi: Nuno cost us the match! His team selection left us totally unbalanced. What on earth was he doing? He needs help selecting his team and system if this is his idea.John: As ever, I can't fault our effort and commitment. We hit the post twice and the crossbar. Their chances went in. It wasn't meant to be. It has still been - and it still is - a fantastic season. Heads up and beat Brentford on Thursday.Nicholas: I worry that after this poor and insipid performance, we will finish our season with a whimper rather than a roar. To have come so far and miss out on an FA Cup final, and possibly Europe, would be a harsh kick in the teeth for a team that have played well for much of the season. We simply weren't up for the occasion and bottled it.City fansBrian: City had the run of the green. Luck was on their side and Forest must feel that our goal was protected at all levels. But City will be full of belief now and they held on with a clean sheet. Given their really poor mid-season, this is a remarkable position to be in. They are in a great position to win the FA Cup and achieve Champions League qualification. We would have taken both at the start of this season.John: It just shows what a toll playing too many games is having on the players.  They now have energy and enjoyment they had lost in mid-season. But what a performance from Forest - good luck to them for Champions League places!Gene: At first, I was surprised to see Rico Lewis in the line-up, and even more so when he scored. They had possession and looked comfortable, but defensively were sloppy on multiple occasions. Forest are a counter-attacking team and were unable to capitalise on City's mistakes and poor decisions. The match could have gone either way, so City were fortunate to leave with the win.Krish: It was quite good back to our old ways. Lewis was brilliant and so was Bernardo Silva and Mateo Kovacic. Hopefully, Erling Haaland and Rodri get a bit of playing time against Southampton.09:12No, this season has not been good - Guardiola.

We lost some balls and the fatigue was there."The ball, the way it bounces for both sides is difficult to control. But we managed it and I am really pleased to be in the FA Cup final again."On Rico Lewis' early goal: "The action was really good. Rico moves into the pockets like very few players, he is very good in the small areas. He is an extraordinary player. He is so strong and so clever."On whether it was Mateo Kovacic's best game of the season: "No, the last game against Aston Villa he was extraordinary. If you put players close to him, it helps him and his composure is really good."On facing Crystal Palace in the final: "Just take a look at what they did yesterday. We played them a few weeks ago and they were 2-0 up."The pace they have up front is brilliant and they have an extraordinary manager. They have so much physicality and experience. Hopefully it will be better than last season in the final against Manchester United."On how the season will be viewed if they win the FA Cup and finish in the Champions League spots: "Champions League is the most important thing. That would limit the damage because this season has not been good."I want to say thank you to our fans. I know how difficult it is to come here with work tomorrow, the tickets and the travel. I can't thank them enough - and hopefully they will join us and see us in the final."19:01 27 April'Unlucky' Forest hit woodwork three times in second half.

Today was a tough game but we showed a different side to our game where we can survive and get through it."We have so many midfielders who can keep the ball and that allows the front men to have more freedom."On what winning the FA Cup would mean: "A lot. We showed character today, and this season we have shown character. It's not been smooth sailing but we have picked ourselves up and shown we are a top team."We have top players and we can get through tough situations. Now we are on the up, we can take it into next season."'We have found ourselves again'published at 18:57 27 April18:57 27 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesManchester City midfielder Mateo Kovacic has been speaking to ITV following the result: "It was a deserved win for us. From the first minute, we scored the goal with Rico [Lewis]. They are a strong team and they had a few chances, but it is a deserved win and we are happy for another final."On what has changed now that Manchester City are unbeaten in eight games: "We have found ourselves again. The team is getting stronger and everyone is 100% focused."A lot of players came back very strong. When we are all back, we are a strong team. This season has not been how we wanted, but we are in another FA Cup final and in the top four [in the Premier League]."18:52 27 AprilMan City beat Forest to reach FA Cup final.

Four of those have come under current manager Pep Guardiola, with only Chelsea (5) reaching more finals in the competition since he took charge of the club.With his second-minute opener, Rico Lewis (20 years and 157 days) became the youngest player to score for Manchester City at Wembley since Steve MacKenzie in May 1981 (19 years and 172 days) in the FA Cup final against Tottenham.Josko Gvardiol has scored 11 goals for Manchester City across all competitions, the joint-most by a defender for a Premier League club since the start of last season alongside Newcastle United's Fabian Schar (11).18:37 27 AprilLewis gives Man City early lead in FA Cup semi-final.

My predictions are so bad at the moment, there is a good chance I will be.Sutton's prediction: 1-2Read the full predictions and have your say here22:32 26 AprilFA Cup semi in the north?

I love that. The guy doesn't play and I allow him to be a manager. He will help the guys there and it is the way we create a team. It is something special when the guys who are injured and don't play, they help each other. I like it a lot."Erling Haaland is back in individual training, but Guardiola is not sure of a return date yet: "He is getting better and he is injured and been involved [off the pitch] as well. He feels better, but I don't know when [he will be back]. The injury is not a comfortable one, I would say. He is not a small guy, but he is getting better. We will see in the next days how he is."The City boss has great respect for Nottingham Forest manager Nuno Espirito Santo: "He has been incredible - qualifying for Europa League with Wolves and now with Nottingham Forest. He has done a really good job. The guys have good skills, and I admire that they defend well and have a good spirit. They have the transition with top, top players up front."Guardiola said City must overcome the fans of Forest as well as the players to reach the FA Cup final: "We have a serious and tough, tough rival. The Nottingham Forest people and fans, it is a long time since they have played the semi-final of the FA Cup, but for many years we have been there in the competition."Despite the struggles the club have had in 2024-25, he said City could be in a worse predicament: "Too many matches this season have not been good. We will avoid bigger damage for the club. From my point of view, the biggest thing in the season is the Premier League. The FA Cup keeps us safe. But the Premier League dictates how good your season has been, and it has not been good - but it could be worse."Follow all of Friday's news conferences and the rest of the day's football newsprevious pagePage 1 of 40123456…40next pageHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright © 2025 BBC.
