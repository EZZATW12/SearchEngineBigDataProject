Guardiola still burning with desirePublished30 March'His swagger is back' but Villa won't 'waste time' on Rashford futurePublished30 MarchForest v Man City, Palace v Villa - semi-final drawPublished30 MarchStranglehold broken & chance to 'rewrite history'Fourteen-time record winners Arsenal, Manchester United - who have won the cup 13 times - and Chelsea, Tottenham and Liverpool, each with eight victories, have already been knocked out.And that means the stranglehold the Premier League's so-called 'big six' - the five teams above plus City - have had on the FA Cup in recent years could be broken.Since Wimbledon's shock triumph in 1988, only four teams outside of the 'big six' have lifted the trophy - Everton in 1995, Portsmouth in 2008, Wigan in 2013 and Leicester City four years ago.Even Spurs, technically part of the elite group, have lifted the FA Cup just once in that period - in 1991. That means five teams have accounted for 31 of the past 36 FA Cup victories.But this could be the year an unfancied team triumphs - unless City, who have reached the semi-finals a record seven times in a row, prevail again. "No team has done it [got to seven consecutive semis] and it will be difficult for one team to do what these legendary players, the new ones and the old, have done. It is unbelievable," said Guardiola.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, FA Cup highlights: Preston North End 0-3 Aston VillaPalace, Forest and Villa will all believe they have the firepower to prevent City from winning the cup for the second time in three years. City's last trophyless season came at the end of the first year of Guardiola's tenure in 2016-17. And in Forest they face a club six points above them in the league and who have won four of their five previous meetings in the FA Cup, dating back to 1902. "Pep has always taken the domestic competitions seriously and it's a great record he's got," said former Manchester United captain Roy Keane on ITV."The two semi-finals are hard to call. They're two really good games."Nottingham Forest are going along nicely. They've had some good breaks with the penalty shootouts but they're more than capable of sitting in and beating City."Palace have been eliminated by Villa in all three FA Cup campaigns in which they have met. As well as a trip to Wembley, Unai Emery's Villa are also gearing up to face Paris St-Germain in the Champions League quarter-finals and are still in contention for a top-four finish in the league.Emery said: "We can take two objectives through the FA Cup - to get a trophy and play in Europe. In a case like that, it's fantastic."To be consistent in Premier League is really the [main] objective we have but being like we are now, in the FA Cup, we have to enjoy with the supporters because this competition means a lot for them."But Palace will be no easy task for Villa, with only Liverpool in better form than the Eagles over their past 10 league matches.Boss Oliver Glasner said: "I think it's something special that the two semi-finals are played in the same stadium as the final and this is something very English. I really like it and we will be ready in four weeks to win this game."Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, former Middlesbrough and Fulham goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer, added: "This is what the FA Cup is about - being able to dream."[It is a chance for] clubs who may not necessarily think they have a chance to win the FA Cup but are now in a great position to rewrite history."What information do we collect from this quiz?Related topicsNottingham ForestAston VillaManchester CityFA CupCrystal PalaceFootballMore on this storyListen to the latest Football Daily podcastGet football news sent straight to your phonePublished31 JanuaryComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 295Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions10156 viewing10k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished13 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
