We played an outstanding game and had incredible chances, missed a penalty. We conceded with one chance we gave away. Our approach was magnificent. Seven times in a row semi-final in the FA Cup, no team has done it and it will be difficult for any other to do what these legendary players, the new ones and the old ones, will have done."On seven semi-finals in a row: "It is unbelievable. The way we competed today compared to the way we played in the first game here [in the Premier League]. I was not good enough to overcome that situation then. We were sloppy for many games and I was not able to let them realise is what they have done today. For example Brighton was a difficult game, we didn't play our best but we fought. This is what had to happen".On Nico O'Reilly: "He is an attacking midfielder. He is physical, he is strong. He is really, really good."On what he changed at half-time: "The first half we played with the same intensity as the second. The difference was that we played better with the ball with more composure - we were more calm. I said at half-time, we have the game in our hands."On whether they will appoint a new penalty taker after Haaland's miss: "Absolutely not. Against Brighton he scored."On facing Nuno Espirito Santo's Nottingham Forest in the semi-final: "Sometimes we've lost when we've performed well. In the home game we won 3-0 so when we lose one game it looks like a disaster. It's not true. They are third in the table, they are a very good team and we are pleased to play against them in Wembley with our fans."On how he would sum up the campaign if the FA Cup is the one title his side win this season: "We won one title already. We won the Community Shield, we won it. This season has been poor, nothing is going to change. It has not been good, that is not going to change. Last year we played in a final and could not win it. We have an incredible target to qualify for the Champions League next season and that is what we are going to try to do."9165Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingPostpublished at 19:03 British Summer Time 30 March19:03 BST 30 MarchFT: Bournemouth 1-2 Man CityBut Erling Haaland has failed to convert three of his last six penalties for Manchester City (two saved, one off the woodwork) - after scoring each of his previous 11, between September 2023 and August 2024.That includes in penalty shootouts.4017Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingPostpublished at 19:02 British Summer Time 30 March19:02 BST 30 MarchFT: Bournemouth 1-2 Man CityManchester City’s Erling Haaland became the first player to score 30 or more goals in all competitions in each of his first three seasons while playing for a Premier League club since Ruud van Nistelrooy for Manchester United (from 2001-02 to 2003-04).7918Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharing'We have not been the team we wanted to be'published at 18:59 British Summer Time 30 March18:59 BST 30 MarchFT: Bournemouth 1-2 Man CityBournemouthBournemouth boss Andoni Iraola, speaking to BBC Sport: "I think the game is quite clear to analyse - the first half was good from us.

We couldn't keep the same intensity level, we were not as aggressive and we were a lot more passive. "Even with the changes, we were lacking energy, especially up front. We were not able to play at the same level we did in the first half."On whether Kepa should have saved Omar Marmoush's goal: "Yes probably. There is a chance but overall I don't think we lost because of this. Overall I think we were better in the first half, we played the game we wanted to play but second half they were better and we couldn't affect the long possessions. We were not dangerous enough."On whether the injuries/suspensions in the side had a negative impact on the side today: "Yes. It isn't just the starting eleven. It gives you good options from the bench to give us the same level. I felt David Brooks, Evanilson, after 50 minutes or something - they can play but they don't play at the same intensity level, the press is not the same as before. We couldn't maintain that level."On the goals for the team for the remainder of the season: "We need to recover quickly because we are playing in three days against Ipswich and try and win.

O'Reilly played in Omar Marmoush, just on for the injured Haaland, and the Egypt attacker's strike crept under Kepa who should have done better.Last shot at glory for 'legends'?
