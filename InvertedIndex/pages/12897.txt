It was hard not to feel sympathy for the 20-year-old newcomer.The manner of City's defeat and elimination only confirmed what Guardiola surely already knows – that it is time to usher in a new era following the years of success.Watch: How to win the Champions League - Real MadridWatch: Mbappe - the definitive story of a football prodigyHolders Real Madrid looking ominousThis is Real Madrid's tournament. This is Real Madrid's time of year.The noises of appreciation that swept around the stadium as Carlo Ancelotti's holders dominated carried an ominous tone for every other contender aiming to stop Real claiming a 16th triumph in this tournament.When Real lost 2-0 at Liverpool in November they looked laboured and off the pace, without Vinicius Junior and with Mbappe still finding his feet after his move to Madrid.Here, Mbappe looked every inch the world-class operator he is, showing class and composure to lob Ederson for his first, then showing superb sleight of foot to bamboozle Gvardiol for his second.The hat-trick goal crowned the 26-year-old's perfect night, fully deserving the rapturous standing ovation he received when substituted 13 minutes from time.Vinicius Junior, Rodrygo and Mbappe form an attacking triumvirate that is a threat to any opponents they face and it was all too much for City, even more so after they lost Stones to injury after only seven minutes.And, of course, watching it all from the sidelines was the Champions League's history man, Ancelotti, who has been over this course and distance so successfully, a five-time winner as a coach. He knows how this particular job is done.Real Madrid, the most successful and ruthless operators in the Champions League, look in the mood once more.The Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

RightReal Madrid’s 3-2 win in the first leg against Man City was the 40th time they’ve won the first leg of a European knockout stage tie away from home – they’ve progressed from 37 of the previous 39, failing only against Odense Boldklub (1994-95 UEFA Cup) and Ajax (2018-19 UEFA Champions League).Man City’s 3-2 defeat in the first leg was the fifth time they’ve lost the first leg of a UEFA Champions League knockout stage tie, going on to be eliminated on each of the previous four occasions.Real Madrid have lost just one of their six UEFA Champions League home games against Manchester City (W3 D2), going down 2-1 in the round of 16 in 2019-20.Manchester City have lost nine of their 27 UEFA Champions League meetings with Spanish opponents, almost twice as many defeats than against sides from any other nation (5 vs French and German teams). Indeed, their nine losses vs Spanish teams accounts for 28% of their overall defeats in the competition (9/32).Real Madrid have only failed to score in one of their last 78 UEFA Champions League home games (207 goals scored), doing so in a 3-0 loss to CSKA Moscow in December 2018.Manchester City have lost each of their last three away games in the UEFA Champions League. Only once previously have they last four in a row in the competition (under Roberto Mancini between 2011 and 2012), while this is already Pep Guardiola’s longest losing streak away from home in the Champions League.Manchester City have lost three UEFA Champions League games when scoring the first goal this season – 1-4 against Sporting CP, 2-4 against PSG and 2-3 against Real Madrid. No team has ever lost four games despite going 1-0 up in a single campaign before.Carlo Ancelotti and Pep Guardiola will be the first managers to face each other on 10 occasions in the UEFA Champions League, eight of which have come while in charge of their current clubs, Real Madrid and Manchester City. Ancelotti has won four of the nine meetings so far (D3 L2), while he’s never lost at home to the Spaniard (W2 D2).Real Madrid’s Jude Bellingham has scored more UEFA Champions League goals against Manchester City than he has versus any other opponent (3). It’s also the joint-highest number of goals an English player has scored against an English opponent in the competition (Frank Lampard also 3 vs Liverpool).Manchester City striker Erling Haaland has scored 49 goals in 48 UEFA Champions League games, with his brace in the first leg his first ever strikes against Real Madrid. A goal here would see him become the fastest to 50 goals in terms of both appearances and age (24 years 213 days).Live TextPostat 90 minutes plus 590'+5Match ends, Real Madrid 3, Manchester City 1.Full Timeat 90 minutes plus 590'+5Second Half ends, Real Madrid 3, Manchester City 1.Goal!at 90 minutes plus 290'+2Goal!
