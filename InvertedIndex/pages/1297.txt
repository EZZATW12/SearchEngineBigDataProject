Year 8 pupil Hugo said the new uniform was "quite inclusive, with it all being the same."The decision to change the uniform came out of an aim to encourage more sport and outdoor education, said headteacher Ruth Shaw."I really object to the idea that what you wear is key to your learning experience," she said."I just do not believe that wearing a shirt and tie means that you will learn better."Headteacher Ruth Shaw said she believed traditional uniform did not necessarily improve learningLouis, who is 14 and in Year 9, said the new uniform felt "a lot comfier", adding: "My shirt's not bugging me and I'm not getting into arguments with teachers about it.""It's really smart and more modern," said 13-year-old Millie-Jane.Hugo, who is in Year 8, said the sports kit "takes on board the school's Olympic heritage."The school is named after William Penny Brookes, a 19th Century Much Wenlock resident who founded the Wenlock Olympian Games, which went on to inspire the Olympic Games we know today.Acting head of PE Antony Parkes said: "We really value movement, and [want] students to be more settled in their classrooms." Mr Parkes noted that changing out of uniform into PE kit had been "eating into [lesson] time," but that students would still be given time to change into fresh clothes after playing sport. Antony Parkes said exercise and movement was really important at the schoolWhen asked if changing the school's uniform could create unwanted costs for some parents, Ms Shaw said "the fact that it is the existing PE kit does make a little bit of a difference.""So it is a case of topping up [on kit] rather than buying lots and lots of new uniform."She added: "I'm under no illusion that there are some families who [will] have to invest heavily in this.""We are working with suppliers to try and bring the price of the uniform down."Parents were consulted by the school, and offered the chance to raise any concerns about the proposed changes.Sian, who has two children at the school, said her family was "really happy" with the change.She said her daughter, who struggled with sensory issues when wearing a shirt and tie, had benefited from wearing more comfortable clothes to school.Follow BBC Shropshire on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.
