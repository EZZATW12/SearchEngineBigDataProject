I agree they should."She said she did not feel listened to and she subsequently persuaded 56 children to sign her petition at school, and "some of them were boys".Sainsbury's did not reply to her petition, but she said when she returned to the store this year, "there were pockets in the girls' trousers".When approached by the BBC, Sainsbury's did not confirm whether Georgia's letter and petitioning influenced its decision.ContributedGeorgia's letter said that girls needed pockets to carry things, as well as boysContributedSainsbury's response to Georgia said that girls trousers should have pockets. The TU spokesperson said its range was "thoughtfully designed with comfort and durability in mind".Contradicting the letter sent from Sainsbury's to Georgia, the spokesperson added a "wide selection" had been offered by the brand for "many years" and this includes "trousers with pockets".LISTEN: 'It's unfair - girls need pockets too'Follow Suffolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.More stories like this Would you rather wear trainers and joggers as a school uniform?Parents' dismay at 'draconian' uniform rulesAnother school bans skirts for new September termSchool uniformSainsbury'sIpswichRelatedBranded school uniforms to change for four million pupils under plans4 hrs agoFamily & EducationSchool swaps uniform for tracksuits and trainers10 Apr 2025ShropshireFamilies spending hundreds on school uniforms hope new law tackles costs20 Feb 2025Northern IrelandMore2 days ago'Incredible journey' set to take team to promotionThe team played in front of just 40 fans in 2019 but more than 10,000 watched them at Portman Road in March. 2 days agoSuffolk3 days agoQuarry decision delayed due to conservation statusThe plans have already been subject to delays and a High Court challenge. 3 days agoSuffolk4 days agoSix months of gas works to start on busy roadThe work to replace 120-year-old metal gas pipes along Woodbridge Road will continue until October.4 days agoSuffolk5 days agoEx-navy base plans to be discussed after objectionsThe former Royal Navy site is currently being turned into new homes.5 days agoSuffolk5 days agoVacant shop to reopen in town centre after a decadeCouncillors say the building has been "blighting" the town centre.5 days agoSuffolkBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.
