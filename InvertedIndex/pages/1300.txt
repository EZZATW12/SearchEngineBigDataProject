But there were concerns over whether a "cost cap" on uniforms would work.PA MediaThe minister said when the bill becomes law the cost of uniforms will fallGivan said the new bill provided "scope" for a price cap to be introduced, but that more work needed to be done on it."The cap could be in relation to numbers of branded items, such as PE kits, or in relation to the cost of an individual item or the overall uniform requirements," he said in a statement.Schools are already given guidance by the Department of Education (DE) that uniforms should "represent value for money for families".The existing guidance also advises schools "to keep costs to a minimum and ensure that items are available 'off the peg' from a number of retail outlets".But the new School Uniforms (Guidelines and Allowances) Bill will make it compulsory for schools to follow that guidance by law.Getty ImagesBranding and logos on school uniforms were a particular problem for those who responded to the consultation Givan said that once the new legislation was in place "it will remain a matter for schools to determine whether to have a uniform and, if so, what that uniform will be"."What the legislation will do is work in tandem with strengthened, statutory guidance to ensure that affordability is transparent and at the centre of school uniform policies," his statement continued."Schools will have to consult with parents and pupils, and then publish the rationale and cost of their uniforms, as well as the range of suppliers it can be bought from."The minister said the new law would reduce the costs of school uniforms.But parents and others who responded to the department's consultation on it had called for a wide range of measures to be introduced to lower the cost of uniforms.People who responded said branding and logos on school uniforms were a particular problem.Some said having to buy a branded uniform, or one with a school logo, made uniforms more expensive.'Outdated and unnecessary'There was also some opposition to schools requiring pupils to wear PE kit made by a particular brand.Though some respondents said branded uniforms were "often better quality and harder wearing".Some questioned whether school uniforms were needed at all, calling them "outdated and unnecessary" and "out of touch with modern society".Other respondents said that girls should have the option to wear trousers and "should not be forced to wear skirts".Following its introduction on Tuesday, the proposed new law is expected to be debated by MLAs in the assembly in March.Branded uniforms are a 'financial drain' on parents Should there be a school uniform price limit?NI educationSchool uniformNorthern IrelandRelatedApology for autistic teen left without school for over a year5 days agoNorthern IrelandBelfast girls get a taste of the NFL with JagTag7 days agoNorthern IrelandParents devastated pre-school could close over lack of funding19 Apr 2025Northern IrelandMore52 mins agoEx-Irish police officer  'honoured' to lead Disappeared investigationMr Henry's appointment marks the first time someone from An Garda Síochána has taken the role. 52 mins agoNorthern Ireland3 hrs agoAirbus confirms deal for Spirit operations in BelfastThe deal was first announced in July last year as part of a wider break up of the Spirit business.3 hrs agoNorthern Ireland3 hrs ago'Trailblazer' honoured with Blue PlaqueMay Hezlet, from Aghadowey, won her first golf competition at the age of 11. 3 hrs agoNorthern Ireland3 hrs agoDaughter of murdered MP calls for Kneecap apologyVideo emerged of a 2023 gig appearing to show a band member saying: "The only good Tory is a dead Tory."3 hrs agoNorthern Ireland4 hrs agoBranded school uniforms to change for four million pupils under plansThe government says it will save parents £50 a year, but retailers say it could end up costing more.4 hrs agoFamily & EducationBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.
