Soon, you will hear from us."We are going to make history, because we are not going to continue to bear what we are putting up with."Barcelona boss Hansi Flick later echoed the call for action when speaking to the media."For me, it's only a sport," said the German. "It's only a game. It's only football. It is our responsibility to protect not only the players, but all the people involved in the game."It's not nice that happened today. Of course, sometimes on the pitch there are some decisions that are about emotion but after the match, we should be done with it. Something must be done."After February's letter of complaint, which followed a 1-0 loss to Espanyol, La Liga president Javier Tebas said Real Madrid had "lost their head".Later that month the RFEF condemned the "repulsive" abuse suffered by referee Jose Luis Munuera Montero after he sent off Real Madrid midfielder Jude Bellingham against Osasuna.Related topicsBarcelonaEuropean FootballReal MadridFootballMore on this storyListen to the latest Football Daily podcastTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9455 viewing9.5k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished17 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
