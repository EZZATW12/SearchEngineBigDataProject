The victory moved them above Manchester City, who had posted a late victory against fellow top-five contenders Aston Villa earlier in the week. Chelsea also earned an important 1-0 win against Everton on Saturday to climb to fifth, and are only two points behind Newcastle and tied with Nottingham Forest, who have a game in hand. After the latest set of results in the English top flight, only five points separate Villa, in seventh, and third-placed Newcastle.With the Premier League's top five guaranteed a spot in the Champions League next term, the race for Europe remains closely contested as the season enters its final weeks. Forest have twice lifted the European Cup but have not played in Europe's premier competition since 1980, while Villa reached the quarter-finals this season, where they lost to Paris St-Germain. As many as 11 European places are up for grabs and there will definitely be a minimum of eight Premier League teams - up from the usual seven - playing in Europe next season, but things could change in the coming weeks.It means Crystal Palace, down in 12th, remain in contention for a place in Europe through the league as well as if they win the FA Cup. BBC Sport takes a look at how many teams could qualify for each of the European competitions - the Champions League, Europa League and Conference League.Newcastle go third after beating IpswichJackson goal sends Chelsea back into Champions League placesSessegnon snatches Fulham win at SouthamptonWho do the contenders have left to play?Liverpool: Tottenham (H); Chelsea (A); Arsenal (H); Brighton (A); Crystal Palace (H)Arsenal: Bournemouth (H); Liverpool (A); Newcastle (H); Southampton (A)Newcastle: Brighton (A); Chelsea (H); Arsenal (A); Everton (H)Nottingham Forest: Brentford (H); Crystal Palace (A); Leicester (H); West Ham (A); Chelsea (H)Manchester City: Wolves (H); Southampton (A); Bournemouth (H); Fulham (A)Chelsea: Everton (H); Liverpool (H); Newcastle (A); Manchester United (H); Nottingham Forest (A)Aston Villa: Fulham (H); Bournemouth (A); Tottenham (H); Manchester United (A)Bournemouth: Arsenal (A); Aston Villa (H); Manchester City (A); Leicester (H)Fulham: Aston Villa (A); Everton (H); Brentford (A); Manchester City (H)Brighton: Newcastle (H); Wolves (A); Liverpool (H); Tottenham (A)Brentford: Nottingham Forest (A); Manchester United (H); Ipswich (A); Fulham (H); Wolves (A)Crystal Palace: Nottingham Forest (H); Tottenham (A); Wolves (H); Liverpool (A)How many teams could qualify for the Champions League?Depending on how things pan out this season there will be between eight and 11 teams from the Premier League taking part in Europe next season.A minimum of five of those will be in the Champions League, which is higher than the usual four because of England's performance in Uefa's coefficient rankings.That number could rise to six should Arsenal win the Champions League and finish outside the top five - an unlikely prospect - or even seven if that happens and Manchester United or Tottenham win the Europa League.How many teams could qualify for the Europa League?The maximum number of Premier League teams who could be competing in the Europa League is three. Two places will likely go to the team who finishes sixth and the FA Cup winners.However, if the cup winners have already secured a European place it will then go to the next highest placed side that has not qualified for Europe.A third place could be awarded if Chelsea win the Conference League and fail to qualify for the Champions League.What about the Conference League?There will be one Conference League place awarded to a Premier League team.Currently, that will go to Carabao Cup winners Newcastle, but that could change if Eddie Howe's side qualify for the Champions League or the Europa League. As Newcastle currently sit inside the top four that looks likely.There is realistic scenario where finishing ninth or 10th in the Premier League could earn you a spot in the Conference League.How could 11 English teams be in Europe?This could happen, but it is highly improbable.It would require Arsenal to win the Champions League, Manchester United or Tottenham to win the Europa League and Chelsea to lift the Conference League trophy, and all three winners to finish outside the top six.Arsenal are second in the Premier League and highly unlikely to finish outside the top five.Related topicsNottingham ForestFulhamBrentfordChelseaAston VillaBrighton & Hove AlbionPremier LeagueManchester CityCrystal PalaceBournemouthNewcastle UnitedFootballMore on this storyListen to the latest Football Daily podcastGet football news sent straight to your phonePublished31 JanuaryTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8712 viewing8.7k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published13 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
