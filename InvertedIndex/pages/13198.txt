If Vincent Kompany's side win while their rivals lose then the earliest point they would have an unassailable advantage would be 19 April, if they beat Heidenheim on that date.That scenario is, however, unlikely meaning in its simplest terms Bayern will win the title if they collect five wins from their remaining seven games, regardless of what anyone else does.Kane could in fact end the season with two trophies, because Bayern are in the quarter-finals of the Champions League, where they will face Inter Milan.A title you don't want to have?Should Bayern win a trophy this season it will mean Kane happily departs a club no-one wants to be in - a trophyless career.There are many famous players with that unfortunate record.During the 1990s, Matt le Tissier was widely regarded as one of the most gifted attackers of his generation but never won a trophy. He spent his entire career at Southampton and was capped eight times by England.Antonio di Natale was capped 42 times for Italy and played in the final of Euro 2012. At club level he mainly played for Udinese and was twice top scorer in Serie A but finished his career without a major trophy.Meanwhile, Yildiray Basturk won 49 caps for Turkey and played the majority of his career in the Bundesliga but never won significant silverware, coming closest when Bayer Leverkusen finished runners-up in 2001-02.Take Shearer's record? What next for Kane?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Harry Kane may fancy chasing down the all-time Premier League top scorer record currently held by Alan ShearerShould Kane win a trophy this season he may feel ready for a new challenge.The striker has been linked with a return to the Premier League, with reported interest from Liverpool., externalKane is contracted to Bayern until 2027 and has indicated he remains very happy at the club.But there is one record he might like to chase down - the all-time top scorer in the Premier League.Former Blackburn and Newcastle striker Alan Shearer has long held the record with 260 goals, but Kane is second in the standings with 213.If he replicates his current scoring rate in the Bundesliga, then he could well surpass Shearer's total within two seasons.That could prove too tempting a challenge to overlook.What information do we collect from this quiz?Related topicsBayern MunichGerman BundesligaFootballMore on this storyListen to the latest Football Daily podcastGet football news sent straight to your phonePublished31 JanuaryTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions10224 viewing10k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished18 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
