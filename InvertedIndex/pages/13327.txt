"When I called him after the game he says, 'ah, it wasn't as exciting as other games of Liverpool' when he watched the game against Lille."I had to try to explain to him these games you can easily lose if you are starting to force all kinds of difficult balls but he's not always agreeing with me then."As a manager I was quite happy with our performance against Lille as they were well organised as a team."I think there was one moment in the game I can remember Curtis (Jones) tried to play, from the halfway line, a bit of a ball that had a bit of risk and we lost that ball and they counter-attacked us."That is the risk you have if you play against a low-block team. (Nottingham) Forest is probably the best in the league if you play these stupid balls - I call them stupid balls - which my father would love to see us playing a bit more."There is the risk of them creating much more chances and it is a difficult balance of taking the risk and conceding a lot or having control and not creating as much."Against this team (Ipswich) going 1-0 down, like we have seen against Forest, is even a bigger problem especially."I understand it is difficult for fans who come to the stadium to see us winning but hopefully also scoring a lot of goals in an exciting match but you need two teams for that and the better we do the less likely it is teams come to Anfield and say, 'OK, let's go to a high press and press them all over the pitch'."Related topicsLiverpoolPremier LeagueFootballTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions10218 viewing10k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished19 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
