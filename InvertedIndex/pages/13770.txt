In a sensational plot twist, Eubank arrived at the venue alongside his father, Chris Eubank Sr. The pair had supposedly been estranged for years and Eubank Sr had criticised the match-up."I'm happy to have this man back with me. We upheld the family name - onwards and upwards," Eubank added. The heartwarming reconciliation seemingly gave Eubank a boost as he extended his record to 35 wins in 38 fights.In a result which could have easily gone either way, Benn, 28, loses for the first time in 24 professional fights."I felt like it was a close fight. I'm not going to say 'yeah I should have won that' - I've got to watch it back. It was close," he said. Eubank was taken to the hospital after the fight which is standard procedure for boxers after a gruelling fight. Benn suggested his rival was being checked for damage to his jaw.The boxers signed a two-fight deal and, after putting on such a show, could contest a rematch later this year.

He too was joined by his father to the tune of Tina Turner's 'Simply the Best' - a song which the legend Eubank Sr walked out to in his heyday.The 65,000 sell-out crowd erupted when Nigel Benn and Eubank Sr shared a hug before the first bell. The 'wall of sound' South Stand amplified the already ear-splitting pandemonium, and a sea of camera lights added to the spectacle.But the bloodline rivalry, doping scandal and egg slap all led to their sons, nobody else, standing face-to-face inside a boxing ring.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Nigel Benn lost to Chris Eubank Sr in 1990 before a controversial draw in 1993A back-and-forth grudge matchBenn loaded up with every punch from the opening bell and wobbled Eubank with a left hook in the third. Although he is notoriously a slow starter, Eubank seemed to be struggling with the pace.Actor Idris Elba, celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay and England footballers Marcus Rashford and Declan Rice sprinkled some celebrity stardust as a trademark Eubank uppercut squeezed through Benn's low guard in the fourth.The pair were told to buck up their ideas by the referee as they began talking to each other during the middle of the rounds.The bout was set at a middleweight limit of 11st 6lb (160lbs), though Eubank weighed in 0.05lb over that on Friday.He looked weight-drained in fight week and was hampered by a rehydration clause which limited his weight gain. He was breathing heavily at the end of round five.Benn - who moved up two divisions from welterweight - had landed the more eye-catching shots in the first half of the fight."It's too easy," Eubank told Benn as he began to claw his way back into the contest. Eubank Sr left his front-row seat to join his son's corner after Eubank was cut above the right eye in a clash of heads.A flurry of punches in the 11th earned his nod of approval.There was a touch of gloves before the final round. After everything these two had been through, there was a smidgen of respect.Benn remarkably stayed on his feet after a ferocious, sustained attack by Eubank in the 12th. Both men raised their hands at the end of a enthralling all-British contest, one which will live long in the memory of all those in attendance.Eubank proved he is not yet done, while Benn showed he can mix it at a decent level.After serving up such a delight - one full of drama and a will to win from both men - the clamouring for a rematch will be too loud to ignore.Image source, ReutersImage caption, Benn began the contest aggressively before Eubank edged his way back inRelated topicsBoxingBoxing schedule and results 2025Published1 day agoWatch every Born to Brawl episodePublished28 April 2024More boxing from the BBCNotifications, social media and more with BBC SportPublished31 JanuaryComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 685Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8851 viewing8.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
