Kozlova also shot tamely at Mutch at 0-0 and Whelan headed wide before setting up the opener.Whelan was the provider for Lockwood's second-half strike, laying the ball across for an emphatic finish.Maatta was denied a second by Mutch soon after and Brenna Lovera netted from an offside position at a corner as the City onslaught continued. Replays suggested Lovera may in fact have been onside.Samantha van Diemen's excellent long ball was met with an equally good first touch by Lockwood and the midfielder kept her cool to beat Mutch once again.Motherwell did well to contain City for spells but struggled to create openings of their own.However, their achievements in securing a SWPL top-six finish and reaching the last four of the Scottish Cup give them cause for optimism for next season.Rangers meet Aberdeen in Sunday's semi-final at Hampden (14:10 BST), with the match live on BBC Alba, iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app.What they saidGlasgow City head coach Leanne Ross: "It was a comfortable performance. Our patterns of play came out and the individual quality we have throughout the team shone. All in all, really pleased with the performance and result."I loved lifting silverware as a player. It's no different as a manager but it's all about the players. It's about them getting their hands on the trophy, so they've done the hard work getting themselves into the final and we can go and look forward to that."Motherwell manager Paul Brownlie: "At 1-0, we still had control without the ball. We had a good structure about us, defensively we were sound at points in the game but the second goal almost kills the game."That's two visits to Hampden in three years, which is an incredible achievement for a club like Motherwell, it's about growing and getting better. "It's still pretty raw and we don't want to lose games, but I've got to think of the bigger picture."Related topicsScottish Women's FootballFootballTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9081 viewing9.1k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished4 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Scottish sportWhat is still to be decided as season reaches climax?League reconstruction - why, when & what might it look like?Scotland men's internationals to be shown live on BBCCommonwealth Games: Why is it so special to be part of Team Scotland?From titles to tinpottery - rank Scotland's top 10 clubsElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
