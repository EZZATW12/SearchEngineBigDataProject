I've had about three weeks of training now," she said."At that moment, I thought that was it, season done. Even going into next season I was questioning that but had my scan pretty quick, got the results of that which was very good news, but it was still in question whether I'd be able to get back for the end of the season."It was upsetting at the time but I made it my mission to do everything I could to get back, and I managed to do it for the last two [games]. I'm very pleased with how the recovery and the rehab went."Sunday's match at the Martello Ground in Felixstowe is a 2,150 sellout and Ipswich are hoping for a noisy atmosphere."I've been at the club for six years, in and around the first team for about four years and every single year I've thought about what this day could be like," added Boswell."What the feeling's going to be like of arriving, seeing so many people, lifting the trophy - I've thought about it a lot and I know it's going to live up to those expectations and those dreams that I had."It's a sellout crowd - hopefully everyone brings the noise, brings the atmosphere and just has a really good day celebrating and enjoying the moment."Related topicsFootballWomen's FootballMore on this storyGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated pageTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions10675 viewing11k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished29 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
