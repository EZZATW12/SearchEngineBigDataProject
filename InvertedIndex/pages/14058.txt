Aston Villa midfielder Jordan Nobbs, who has played in every edition of the WSL, is the current record holder with 207 appearances. England international Bright made her first appearance in the WSL for Doncaster Belles in 2011 and went on to feature 32 times over three seasons in the top flight with the Yorkshire club. Following a season in the second tier, she moved to Chelsea before the 2015 campaign and has since amassed a further 168 appearances in 11 seasons - a record for the Blues. Speaking to BBC Three, Bright said: "I had no idea until Tuesday when I was told, so I was like, 'OK'. I don't do the individual stats - I'm more bothered about the team performances and wins. It's a massive achievement and I'm really proud."If I look back to those Doncaster days when it was tough and some heavy losses, I learned a lot and I think it kept me rooted as a player and as a person."I learned a lot about the league, and it's been nice to have seen the journey of the leagues - where we started and where we are now. "The growth of me, individually, has been a credit to all the managers that I've played under, and there's still more to come, so I'm excited."While at Chelsea, she has won seven WSL titles and has been club captain since September 2023.
