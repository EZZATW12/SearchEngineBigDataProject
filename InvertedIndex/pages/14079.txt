Today, it was about getting a job done and getting into a final. A clean sheet was important for us. Some really nice goals from Jane [Ross] and into a final - job done for us."It's not easy to pick a team. There's a lot of quality. We ask them all to produce and we have a lot of top goalscorers in the squad. Having that competition's bringing out the best in each other."Aberdeen head coach Scott Booth: "It was always going to be a tough game for us. We were able to stick with Rangers pretty well for much of the game, but tiredness crept in."It was a great experience and if we can take that energy and fighting spirit into the games coming up, we'll be fine."Hat-trick hero Ross eyeing domestic treble with Rangerspublished at 17:20 27 April17:20 27 AprilJane LewisBBC Sport Scotland Senior ReporterImage source, SNSImage caption, Striker Jane Ross netted three of Rangers' five goals in the semi-final win over AberdeenAfter scoring a hat-trick to book her side's place in the Women's Scottish Cup final, Rangers striker Jane Ross told BBC Scotland: "Obviously very pleasing to be on the scoresheet today and to be contributing to the win.On her hopes of winning a domestic treble this season, Ross added: "Of course we want to win everything we're competing for, so we take it one game at time.

We had a good structure about us. "Defensively we were sound at points in the game but the second goal almost kills the game."When I walked in the door five years ago we tried to build a strategy in terms of making this club the best version it could be. "We built an academy system from scratch, and now we have one of the best academies in the country, which is huge. "In terms of the first team, that's two visits to Hampden in three years, which is an incredible achievement for a club like Motherwell."It's about growing and getting better. I thanked the players, they've given the club this profile and brought us to Hampden and that's down to them."It's still pretty raw and we don't want to lose games, but I've got to think of the bigger picture."Glasgow City 4-0 Motherwell: What Ross saidpublished at 15:20 26 April15:20 26 AprilImage source, SNSGlasgow City head coach Leanne Ross: "It was a comfortable performance. Our patterns of play came out and the individual quality we have throughout the team shone. All in all, really pleased with the performance and result."I loved lifting silverware as a player. It's no different as a manager but it's all about the players. It's about them getting their hands on the trophy, so they've done the hard work getting themselves into the final and we can go and look forward to that."14:48 26 AprilGlasgow City beat Motherwell to ease into Women's Scottish Cup final.

The Ibrox club slipped to second in the SWPL table after they were beaten 2-0 by title rivals Hibs at Meadowbank last weekend. But with the SWPL Cup already in the cabinet and a potential treble still on the table, Potter insists her side need to be fully focused on booking their place in next month's Scottish Cup final. "I'll be honest, it was a down couple of days, which I'd expect," she said. "I think they really felt the loss, which is not a bad thing from my perspective. But we really managed to dig into it and pick the bones of it. "We've spent quite a while looking at the game and looking at certain aspects of the game and what we didn't do so well."We tried to put it right this week and made a very clear point that there's a cut-off point. There's no sulking and feeling sorry for ourselves because we've got another big game to look ahead to for the weekend. "They've been great ever since after that first day back in. We've changed mindsets, we've looked positively at it and they've been really good in training."Booth urges Dons to 'savour' first semi-final published at 18:40 25 April18:40 25 AprilTyrone SmithBBC Sport Scotland Senior ReporterImage source, SNSAberdeen manager Scott Booth wants his side to embrace Sunday's Scottish Cup semi-final with Rangers but admits he is "realistic about the expectations".His team will start as huge underdogs at Hampden. The part-time Dons are eighth in the SWPL, while Scottish Cup holders Rangers are two points off the top and chasing a domestic treble."We are playing against a club and a team that are fully professional and that is where we want to be," Booth said.  "We are not there and I think there is a big space there between the teams that are still fundamentally part-time and the teams that are fully professional."I think we have to be realistic as a club. As a manager I am realistic about the expectations. However it is a cup semi-final and I know that for sure the players will give 100% and more if they can."I want them to enjoy it, I want them to savour it and I want them to experience it. I want the younger players in the squad to use it as part of their development but it is a one-off game and in football we know anything can happen."The gulf between the sides has been illustrated by the two previous meetings of the teams this season, which Rangers won 11-0 and 10-0.However the bigger picture is that Aberdeen have undoubtedly progressed since Booth – a former star for the Dons' men's team – was appointed in October.And that is backed up by fact they will be making their first ever appearance at the national stadium."I think that it does show the club are moving forward," Booth added. "To create a little bit of history for the players to be able to walk out in a semi-final and just enjoy the day and be able to experience something that is being done for the first time."Having been through so much this season, to go out and be able to enjoy a cup semi-final at Hampden is an incredible achievement if you think back to the start of the season and all the ups and downs the players have had."16:24 25 AprilWho do Mum & Dad support? - Crichtons meet at Hampden, published at 16:24 25 AprilWho do Mum & Dad support? - Crichtons meet at HampdenAttributionFootballHearts boss Olid extends contractpublished at 12:55 25 April12:55 25 AprilImage source, SNSHearts manager Eva Olid has signed a contract extension to summer 2026, with the option of a further year.The Spaniard took charge in 2021 and is credited by the club with overseeing a "complete transformation" of the women's team.Under Olid, Hearts have finished fourth in the past two seasons and last year they reached a first Scottish Cup final, losing 2-0 to Rangers."I love this club and this group of players," said Olid."Every season we are progressing and improving as a team."This season the players have developed the philosophy and style of play that we want to implement, which takes time, but I am now very excited about what we can achieve next season."06:29 25 AprilThe club where the captain, top scorer, women's and men's managers are the same person.
