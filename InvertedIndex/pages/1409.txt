A lot of us are still angry, confused, sad, devastated - and some of us don't know how to feel, what to feel," said R.J. Aquino, chairman of Filipino B.C., the organisation that put on the festival. He spoke at a vigil attended by hundreds of people from across the Lower Mainland on Sunday night."Honestly, I'm kind of all of the above right now," he added.That was the sense I got from talking to people in the neighbourhood around the festival site all day: an intense mix of shock, sorrow and fury.Take two Filipino friends I met on the street where it happened, Roger Peralta and Bjorn Villaruel.They both arrived in Canada in 2016 and were having a fabulous evening at the festival, listening to the music and eating the food of their homeland."Suddenly I hear this unimaginable noise," Bjorn said."It was a loud bang," Roger said.Both men describe seeing bodies bouncing off an SUV just meters away from them."I did not run away," Bjorn said. "I actually followed the vehicle, because I felt like I could stop him. "It was horrendous. A lot of people are just lying on the street and crying and begging for help."Almost a day later, Roger said he had not been able to sleep and was in shock, seeing flashes of the horror in his mind over and over and finding himself having to stop and cry.But he also talked of a strong Filipino spirit that he said will lift the community."We have in our culture Bayanihan," he said. It translates as a spirit of unity and cooperation among Filipinos."When you meet another Filipino, even if you don't know them, you greet them, you feel like they're family, even if you're not."ReutersPeople have been placing candles and flowers at a makeshift memorial near the scene of Saturday's car-rammingThe Premier of British Columbia, David Eby, paid tribute to the Filipino community."I don't think there's a British Columbian who hasn't been touched in some way by the Filipino community. "You can't go to a place that delivers care in our province and not meet a member of that community. "Our long-term care homes, our hospitals, child care, schools. This is a community that gives and gives."Bjorn, who works at a hospital as a magnetic resonance imaging technologist, agreed."We are very caring people," he said. Both he and Roger were furious the SUV got into the crowd in the first place. They said they felt let down by Canada.Premier Eby said he feels that rage too."But I want to turn the rage that I feel into ensuring that we stand with the Filipino community," he said in front of a police cruiser blocking access to the crime scene."This event does not define us and the Filipino community or that celebration."Suspect charged after Vancouver car ramming leaves 11 deadWhat we know about the Vancouver car ramming attackUS & CanadaVancouverCanadaRelatedObama, the border and a headdress: The Pope's visits to North America6 days agoUS & CanadaWatch: Toronto plane crash footage analysed by aviation experts18 Feb 2025US & CanadaAll passengers survive crash landing as plane flips at Toronto airport18 Feb 2025US & CanadaMore52 mins agoThe 'Trump effect' and other things to watch for as Canada votesThe BBC's Lyse Doucet breaks down the key issues weighing on voters minds as Canadians cast their ballots.52 mins agoUS & Canada1 hr agoSuspect charged after Vancouver car ramming leaves 11 deadKai-Ji Adam Lo, a 30-year-old resident of the city, has been charged with eight counts of second degree murder.1 hr agoUS & Canada3 hrs agoCanada votes in pivotal election transformed by TrumpThe US president came to dominate on the campaign trail, with the contest being viewed as a referendum on how Canada should engage with him.3 hrs agoUS & Canada5 hrs agoWhat we know about the Vancouver car ramming attackA resident of the city has been charged with murder and work to identify victims is ongoing. 5 hrs agoUS & Canada7 hrs agoA simple guide to Canada's federal electionCanada is holding a national election amid growing tension with the US over trade and tariffs.7 hrs agoUS & CanadaBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.
