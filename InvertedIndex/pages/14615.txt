He loves football, always believes we can win, and he instils that in his players."This was superb. I thought they were excellent. All credit to the manager and the players. You can see what it means to them."I thought this was a real celebration of fans. Two clubs who haven't won a lot of honours in recent times. For us never. A great occasion at Wembley and we stand at the edge of doing something we've never done before."The crowning moment of Glasner's career to date has been winning the Europa League with Eintracht Frankfurt in 2022 - claiming the first major honour in this proud, passionate south London club's history may even top that.It was done under the gaze of three of his predecessors in Roy Hodgson, Alan Smith and Steve Coppell, the latter taking Palace to the 1990 FA Cup final, where they lost after a replay against Manchester United.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, 'Unbelievable performance' - Glasner on Palace winThe headlines will be grabbed, understandably, by the spectacular feats of Eze, who started the ball rolling after 31 minutes with a stunning rising finish past Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez, and Sarr.Sarr drilled in the second just before the hour, then ran clear deep into stoppage time to score, wrapping up a result that sends a clear warning to potential FA Cup final opponents Manchester City and Nottingham Forest.This, however, does not do justice to the excellence running right through Palace's team which will surely give England coach Tuchel food for thought.Everton's Jordan Pickford is rightly established as England's first choice, but Palace goalkeeper Henderson gave the sort of mature display on the big stage that confirms he will provide the sternest competition.Tuchel is known to admire Henderson, and he was there when Palace needed him at Wembley. He saved well from Ezri Konsa's header in the first half, but two stops just after the break from John McGinn and Lucas Digne were crucial, halting any momentum Villa hoped to gather.Crystal Palace captain Guehi, arguably England's best player at Euro 2024, was surprisingly excluded in favour of Newcastle United's Dan Burn for Tuchel's first game against Albania at Wembley, but here he again demonstrated leadership and high quality on the few occasions Villa exerted real pressure.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, How Palace dominated Villa in semi-finalEze's impact earned him the man-of-the-match award, but he will surely have faced strong competition from the brilliant Wharton, who strode through midfield in style, a potent mixture of composure, creation and that priceless ability to win possession then use it well.Former England captain Wayne Rooney is a firm admirer, telling BBC Sport: "Attacking players get a lot of the credit, but Adam Wharton was outstanding. His commitment and winning the ball back - I thought he was the best player on the pitch."This follows rich praise delivered by Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola, who described him as "an excellent holding midfielder".Wharton's somewhat strolling style, socks at half mast, belies a fierce competitive instinct. He was not included in Tuchel's first full England squad as Palace nursed him back after groin surgery, but the German knows what a talent he has at his disposal.He was included in England's under-21s squad, but trained alongside the senior players at St George's Park.Wharton, it was, who robbed Villa's Youri Tielemans to start the move that ended with Sarr scoring Palace's crucial second. It was one of five successful tackles he made, the most of any player in the semi-final.And so Palace go on to their third FA Cup final at Wembley, led by the charismatic Glasner and his eminently watchable team.Can he now succeed where Coppell and Alan Pardew failed and write his name into the Crystal Palace history books?This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, 'The lads put on a show' - Henderson and Guehi on semi-final winRelated topicsFA CupCrystal PalaceFootballMore on this storyLatest Crystal Palace news, analysis and fan viewsGet Crystal Palace news sent straight to your phonePublished26 July 2022Comments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 455Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9675 viewing9.7k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished28 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
