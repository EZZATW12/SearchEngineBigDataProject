The honeymoon continues. I'm very happy, very happy, with a lot of pressure, but that's how it always is."You see success very close and it's normal for stress to increase, but stress is fuel for me, it doesn't bother me, it gives me more energy to think about more things. "As long as I continue to get up in the morning, everything is fine."Ancelotti has 'no conflict' with Perez after defeatPublished19 April'Not the time to discuss future' - Alonso on Real Madrid linksPublished18 April'The message will be clear - it's time for Ancelotti to move on'Published17 AprilReal face Barcelona in the Copa del Rey final on Saturday and will again meet their rivals in La Liga in May.Asked if winning a league and cup double would have any bearing on his future at the club, Ancelotti said: "In football, anything is possible. I'm not surprised by anything, so anything can happen."I don't have any grudges against anyone or anything. I love this job. I loved it the first time, and I'm loving this second spell. "I'd like this to continue as long as possible. If one day it ends, I'll be grateful and I'll take my hat off to this club, nothing else."Related topicsSpanish La LigaEuropean FootballReal MadridFootballMore on this storyListen to the latest Football Daily podcastTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9628 viewing9.6k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished38 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
