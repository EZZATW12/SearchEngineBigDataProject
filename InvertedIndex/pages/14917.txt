It doesn't matter, regardless of the result against Chelsea. Of course we want to try and win the game but even if we don't we have to try and beat Manchester City and we have to try and beat Arsenal."If we win all three games we can potentially finish second. We have to go full throttle in all the games. We know it's tough, we know it's a real challenging end to the season but that's why we're here. "It would be beautiful and lovely to do all of that but that's not how it works so we have to be prepared for all the games."Skinner said United will face a Chelsea side hurting from their brutal Champions League exit at the hands of Barcelona.Chelsea beat United 1-0 when the sides last met in November and Skinner is excited about the challenge of facing the WSL leaders."They want a reaction from the game," he said. "I'm sure they are not happy with the scoreline from both legs."I'm sure they will be hurting and we've got to manage that hurt but also make sure we try and do the same to them."It's a massive challenge but something we are looking forward to, regardless of what shape they are in. We expect a reaction and have to be ready for that."18:26 27 AprilUps, downs and the race for Europe, published at 18:26 27 AprilUps, downs and the race for EuropeAttributionFootball17:48 27 AprilChelsea close in on WSL title - when could they win it?, published at 17:48 27 AprilChelsea close in on WSL title - when could they win it?AttributionWomen's Football16:24 27 April'Not good enough' Palace relegated by West Ham thrashing, published at 16:24 27 April'Not good enough' Palace relegated by West Ham thrashingAttributionWomen's FootballComments5116:23 27 AprilMartinez-inspired Hammers thrash Palace 7-1.

We have to look at the facts and they are that we have not been good enough, not today and not during the season. It's not that difficult, you don't have to be an expert to see that."On West Ham being clinical in front of goal: "I think the sum up of the season is a bit like this. We are not good enough to get the ball in [the net], we concede goals that we shouldn't. Overall we have to learn from it, as a club and as a team we have to learn from this. Today shows what the season has shown, that we are not good enough to stay in the league."On trying to finish the season on a high: "Now we are disappointed, I think the supporters of [Crystal] Palace want to see us going and performing and today we couldn't do it, and we'll try and do it against Leicester and finish the season as we should. Today we are disappointed than looking forward."14:10 27 AprilMartinez's 'brilliant' first-half hat-trick against Palace.

"Everybody is showing me the support and we're trying to find ways to improve."You can say it's a failure this year [but] we also need to go through tough times to get to the next level. You need to look at how you can improve and I'm going to work really hard for this club until they say something else."We have three more games. We have a chance to win a few games, a chance to show the fans and media that we are taking steps. Hopefully Liverpool can be the start of three good games before we go on the break."If we don't show next season that we are better than year one and two, I will raise my hand and say this is not good enough. It's tough right now, we don't look good in the table. But I guarantee this year we will have some good learnings to use for the third year."We talk about patience, the extension of my contract, how we want to play and it takes time to develop and learn that."'It's really important we hold onto fifth' â€“ Whiteleypublished at 15:54 25 April15:54 25 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesInterim manager Amber Whiteley is targeting a top-five finish as Liverpool look to end the 2024-25 Women's Super League campaign on a high.Liverpool, who achieved their best WSL finish of fourth last season, currently occupy fifth spot but are only two points clear of Brighton, while West Ham and Everton sit a further two points back.In their remaining matches, the Reds face struggling Tottenham, who haven't won since January, and Everton at home before traveling to table-toppers Chelsea on the final day of the season."It's really important that we hold onto fifth. That's the aim for us," Whiteley said. "It's the highest we can finish."The teams below us will be wanting to catch us. We've got to make sure every week we're absolutely on our game and we do everything we can to keep fifth place. That starts with Tottenham this weekend."We want to keep improving week on week. We've made great progress over the past couple of months, but we want to keep pushing on and it'll be no different next season."Liverpool will be without Alejandra Bernabe for the remainder of the season due to a muscle injury, while a decision is yet to be made on Leanne Kiernan, who picked up a knock in training.However, leading goal-scorer Olivia Smith will be available after being forced off in the 51st minute against Brighton last weekend."Olivia wasn't as bad as first thought so she's been in full training this week," Whiteley said. "[Leanne] picked up another knock in training on the same leg that she got a knock on against Chelsea. We'll see how she is after further assessment."Hemp to return as City target 'maximum points'published at 15:26 25 April15:26 25 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Lauren Hemp has not played for Man City since November after injuring her kneeInterim manager Nick Cushing says Manchester City "have to win" against Leicester on Sunday as they attempt to keep their slim hopes of Women's Champions League qualification alive.City currently sit seven points behind third-placed Manchester United with three matches remaining and have only won two of their past five league outings, dropping points against Chelsea, Everton, and West Ham.Victory at the King Power Stadium would close the gap to four points, with Manchester United facing unbeaten table-toppers Chelsea on 30 April ahead of next weekend's Manchester derby."Mathematically, we can make Champions League, so we have to continue the ambition of making sure we get maximum points," Cushing said."We know now that we have to get maximum points to make it happen. That starts with Leicester. We have to win. And that means we go into the Manchester United game [on 4 May] potentially with an opportunity to close the gap again."City's Champions League ambitions have been handed a significant boost by the anticipated return of Lauren Hemp, who has been absent since November with a knee injury. However, while Cushing's squad is looking "slightly healthier than it has done over the past few weeks", there is still no return date for Bunny Shaw. The WSL leading goal-scorer hasn't featured since mid-March with a hamstring injury. "Lauren Hemp trained last week and will be involved at some point against Leicester," Cushing said. "That's a huge boost for the club."Alex Greenwood is training and getting close to being involved. Rebecca Knaak got through 60 minutes [against Everton] really successfully after not playing for so long."We'll continue to push the remaining players. We've got another day before we have to pick a team so hopefully if we can get one or two more back, it will give us more confidence."Goalkeeper Tullis-Joyce signs new Man Utd contractpublished at 15:00 25 April15:00 25 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesGoalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce has signed a new contract with Manchester United to remain at the club until June 2028.The 28-year-old United States international has made 34 appearances for the Red Devils since joining from Seattle Reign in September 2023.She became United's first-choice goalkeeper at the start of this season following Mary Earps' departure from the club for Paris St-Germain in the summer."'I am really grateful to have this opportunity to continue the exciting journey we are on," she said."All of us in the team have ever-growing dreams of what we can achieve together. We want to keep making history and I am so proud to keep wearing the Manchester United badge."Marc Skinner's side have the best defensive record in the Women's Super League this term, conceding just nine goals in 19 games, while Tullis-Joyce has kept 13 clean sheets.United's interim head of women's football, Matt Johnson, added: "Phallon has been exceptional for us this season both on the pitch as a keeper and off the pitch as an ambassador and leader. "This shows the ambition of the club that we can retain one of the best goalkeepers in the world here at Manchester United."'We will look at points after the last game' â€“ Miquelpublished at 13:04 25 April13:04 25 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesLeicester City boss Amandine Miquel refuses to be distracted by the relegation battle even though her side could secure Women's Super League safety this weekend.Leicester currently sit seven points clear of the relegation zone with three matches remaining and could secure their spot in the top flight prior to kick-off on Sunday (15:00 BST) if Crystal Palace lose to West Ham (12:30 BST) earlier in the day. "We will look at the points after the last game and hopefully, we will have enough," Miquel said."If it's not this weekend, we still have two more games for us to get a really good overall result."Leicester are hosting an injury-ravaged Manchester City, who have only won two of their past five WSL matches to leave their Champions League hopes hanging by a thread. However, Miquel is not underestimating Nick Cushing's side."Even though they have injuries, they still have a good squad and good players. We know when you have injuries, it's the moment for others to show themselves. It won't be easier than usual, it'll just be different," she said."We have focused on us. We want to be stronger defensively and make sure we keep the threats offensively."Everton assistant manager Neligan signs new dealpublished at 12:02 25 April12:02 25 AprilImage source, PA MediaEverton's assistant head coach Stephen Neligan has signed a new two-year contract with the club.It comes a day after head coach Brian Sorensen agreed a new deal that keeps him at the Toffees until the end of June 2027.Neligan arrived alongside Sorensen in April 2022, with the pair previously working together at FC Nordsjaelland and Fortuna Hjorring in Denmark."I am delighted to commit my future to this club," Neligan told Everton TV. "It is definitely a place where I feel at home and I know it's big for Brian as well. We both feel happy to be here and excited for the future."Everton are eighth in the Women's Super League this season - four points off fifth-placed Liverpool with three games remaining.Neligan added: "This city has become my home away from home. The people are very similar to where I'm from: hard-working and they have to work for what they get."Brighton 'want to finish on a positive note' - Vidosicpublished at 10:52 25 April10:52 25 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesManager Dario Vidosic has challenged his Brighton side to produce a "complete" 90 minutes of football against Everton on Sunday as they aim to finish the season on a "positive note".Brighton have lost their past three WSL matches, conceding six first-half goals in the process, and have only won once in nine league outings in 2025.However, sitting just two points behind fifth-placed Liverpool with three matches remaining, they could still beat their previous best WSL finish of sixth and Vidosic is determined not to see their season "dwindle away". "We're all frustrated. We're still creating chances, we're still playing some good football, but moments are letting us down and it's about trying to be more complete for 90 minutes. We have to lift our intensity, especially in the first half," Vidosic said."It will be important from the start on Sunday that we're there, we're present, we're brave, and we want to play. It's a terrific opportunity for us to try and get back in the winner's column."We want to put on a good performance, fight for our supporters and ourselves and not dwindle away this season. There's still a lot of positives and we want to finish on as much of a positive note as we can."It doesn't feel like we're too far away from getting that win and celebrating again."Crystal Palace 'have nothing to lose' - Smerud published at 15:25 24 April15:25 24 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesCrystal Palace boss Leif Smerud says they have "nothing to lose" as they prepare for a must-win game against West Ham in the Women's Super League.Bottom-placed Palace were thrashed 4-0 by leaders Chelsea on Wednesday - a result that leaves the club seven points adrift from safety.Smerud's side will be relegated on Sunday if they lose to West Ham."Of course, everyone can read. Even if we're not that good with numbers, all of us, we can all read the scores," Smerud said. "We have to get the points.""We have nothing to lose at all. So it's just to go for it."Palace, who are playing their first season in the WSL, have won just two of their 19 games this term.Smerud said the threat of relegation has "felt real" for some players "for a long time", but added that his side are only focussing on things they can control."When you do that, it tends to turn out better than if you don't. So we look into West Ham on Friday and Saturday and be ready to go," he said."I think it's really interesting psychologically those type of games. I really enjoy them. So let's see if we can make the players enjoy them as well."West Ham 'long way off' top four despite results - Skinnerpublished at 14:59 24 April14:59 24 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesRehanne Skinner says her West Ham team are "a long way off" breaking into the top four of the Women's Super League despite their recent success against the division's leading sides.The Hammers are unbeaten in their past four WSL matches, with draws against leaders Chelsea, third-placed Manchester United and Manchester City in fourth.Skinner said her team showed what they are capable of during those games, but they have now got to "deliver that against the teams that are in and around us".West Ham, who have never finished higher than sixth in the WSL, currently sit seventh in the table - four points off fifth-placed Liverpool with three games remaining. "We're a long way off breaking into that top four in reality," Skinner said."But I think at the same time, the way that we're able to compete stands us in good stead for continuing to progress from where we were last year. "These are all building blocks that will help us to be more successful year on year."08:36 24 AprilEverton head coach Sorensen signs new two-year deal, published at 08:36 24 AprilEverton head coach Sorensen signs new two-year dealAttributionWomen's FootballChelsea 4-0 Crystal Palace: Blues 'not good enough' in attackpublished at 22:02 23 April22:02 23 AprilElizabeth BotcherbyBBC Sport journalistImage source, Getty ImagesDespite moving six points clear at the top of the Women's Super League with victory over Crystal Palace, Chelsea boss Sonia Bompastor cut a frustrated figure at the final whistle, labelling her side's attacking performance as "not good enough". A brace from Catarina Macario and goals for Guro Reiten and Mia Fishel helped Chelsea cruise to a 4-0 victory and marked the sixth time the Blues have scored at least four goals in a league match this season.However, Bompastor believes Chelsea should have scored "six or seven goals" and didn't show the killer mentality of a top team, particularly with their opponents playing the majority of the second half with 10 players following Allyson Swaby's 47th minute red card."The result is really good [but] the second half was not good enough in terms of the high standards we have, especially when Palace were playing one player down," Bompastor told BBC Sport."The really good teams hurt the opposition when they have the opportunity. This game could've finished with six, seven goals, and we only got four, so [it's] not good enough."I'm frustrated. When you want to be one of the best teams in Europe, or in this league, you need to have that mentality. When you have the opportunity to score goals, to kill or hurt the opposition, you have to do that. We need to work on our mentality."21:35 23 AprilChelsea captain Bright makes 200th WSL appearance, published at 21:35 23 AprilChelsea captain Bright makes 200th WSL appearanceAttributionWomen's Football21:28 23 AprilChelsea beat Palace to edge closer to WSL title.

It's not as easy for us to just up stick and move every year and a half," Skinner told BBC Sport."It's not surprising there's evidence that when coaches are in jobs long-term, everything gets better. Constant turnover doesn't provide clubs with stability. "There's only 26 teams in this country that are full-time, including three in the National League. There are not that many jobs. "The turnover is very different in the men's game with the volume of clubs available to move to and the salary attached to it. It's not straight forward in the women's game."Skinner says it is something all WSL managers are likely to experience but she hopes there can be better negotiations around their contracts in the future."It's just how you can be supported and how contracts are structured for managers in the women's game that needs to be talked about more," she added."The length of contracts and the time you are in a position financially to be OK following it. If you get the sack, the time you have that you have been paid out for, for example."People need to think about that when they negotiate and clubs should on how they structure them."16:55 23 AprilSchedule must change for player safety - Miedema, published at 16:55 23 AprilSchedule must change for player safety - MiedemaAttributionWomen's Footballprevious pagePage 1 of 42123456â€¦42next pageHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright Â© 2025 BBC.
