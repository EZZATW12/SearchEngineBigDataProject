It’s the Blues’ longest unbeaten home run against an opponent in their league history.Only against Leeds United (36 between 1953 and 2001) have Everton had a longer winless away run in their league history than their current run of 29 against Chelsea (D13 L16).Chelsea are unbeaten in their last four Premier League games (W2 D2), coming from behind at half-time to draw (2-2 v Ipswich) and win (2-1 v Fulham), their last two.After only losing one of David Moyes’ first 10 Premier League games in charge since returning to the club (W4 D5), Everton have now lost two of their last four in the competition (W1 D1). The Toffees have only won one of their last eight league matches (D5 L2), with that coming via a 90th-minute winner at Nottingham Forest.Everton have drawn more games than any other side in the Premier League this season (14), last drawing more in 2012-13 (15). Indeed, only the bottom three sides Ipswich (4), Leicester (4) and Southampton (2) have won fewer games than the Toffees this term (8).Chelsea are averaging more shots per game at home than any other side in the Premier League this season (18.8). It’s their highest at Stamford Bridge in a single campaign since 2013-14 (19.6).Having conceded at least three goals in each of their opening four Premier League games this season, Everton have now conceded 3+ in just one of their last 29 (a 0-4 defeat to Manchester United in December).Everton boss David Moyes has won none of his 19 Premier League away games against Chelsea (D7 L12) – only Moyes himself (20 vs Liverpool) has faced a side more often on the road without ever winning.Only against Brighton (5) has Chelsea’s Cole Palmer scored more Premier League goals than he has against Everton (4), with all four against the Toffees coming in this exact fixture last season. However, Palmer is without a goal in his last 11 league appearances.Chelsea’s Nicolas Jackson scored nine and assisted three goals in his first 15 Premier League appearances this season, averaging a goal involvement every 99 minutes. He’s since scored none and assisted two in his last 12 games (one every 425 minutes).Live TextPostat 90 minutes plus 590'+5Match ends, Chelsea 1, Everton 0.Full Timeat 90 minutes plus 590'+5Second Half ends, Chelsea 1, Everton 0.Postat 90 minutes plus 590'+5Reece James (Chelsea) wins a free kick in the defensive half.Postat 90 minutes plus 590'+5Foul by Jarrad Branthwaite (Everton).Postat 90 minutes plus 490'+4Offside, Everton.
