The style is the same, the manager is the same, the club is the same. Nothing has changed around Cole. It's just mentally in this moment."You can see he's a little bit worried because he wants to help the team. You can see he's struggling a bit on that. But he showed how happy he was after Fulham. It's just a matter [of whether] we can win games. For sure he's going to score goals."If you go back game by game, he had at least every game one or two chances, so it's not about how the team is playing."Season 'not a failure'Maresca will miss Saturday's game against Everton as he serves a one-match touchline ban.Assistant boss Willy Caballero will be in the dugout."They asked me if I need someone next to me [in the stands]," said Maresca."I don't know if I'll be alone or if I'll be with someone. Tomorrow I'll try to be in the way I always try to be. When the manager is not there it's for the leadership group to step forward and take responsibility."Meanwhile, Maresca says this season is "not a failure".The Blues, who are in the Conference League semi-finals, may not qualify for the Champions League next season."Compared with the past two years, it is not a failure," said Maresca, who is in his first season in charge."How many times in the past two years have Chelsea been in the Champions League [places]? And this season we have been there almost all season. It's an improvement or not? It's already an improvement."Related topicsChelseaPremier LeagueFootballMore on this storyLatest Chelsea news, analysis and fan viewsGet Chelsea news sent straight to your phonePublished26 July 2022Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8827 viewing8.8k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published15 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished40 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
