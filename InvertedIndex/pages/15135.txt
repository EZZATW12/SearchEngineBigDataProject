He's starting to look seriously good.This has been a wonderful session of snooker from him - some of the breaks, the artistry, the cue ball control of the highest order.

Congrats on 100.James: Great stuff Judd Trump. 100 tons for £100k!
Now head down and finish the session strong Judd!Joseph: Take a bow, Judd Trump. Wonderful break building. A century of century breaks in a single season. And he makes the 100th at the Crucible.Connor: Criminal that Judd Trump has only ever won a single World Championship. A man of his quality should have three or four to his name at the very least. Exceptional player.Patrick: A century of centuries for Judd Trump in a season, a £100,000 bonus and to complete it at the Theatre of Dreams makes it that extra special.12524Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharing'Way better than the achievement last time'published at 21:40 British Summer Time 27 April21:40 BST 27 AprilTrump 9-6 MurphyMichael EmonsBBC Sport at the Crucible TheatreA fist pump, a standing ovation from the Crucible crowd and an applause from his opponent, you could see the relief and then delight from Judd Trump as he completed his century of centuries - with a run of 132 for back-to-back centuries.After his 10-4 win over Zhou Yuelong in the first round, Trump, then on 98 centuries, was asked what an achievement it would be to get to the 100.He said: "It would be way better than the achievement last time [when he made 102 in 2019-20] because
I think I played far more tournaments and far more games."I don’t know how many
games I played this season to make it but it would have to be a record by quite
far. I have missed three or four tournaments in the season as well."I didn’t target it at all, I didn’t even think it was a possibility. I
didn’t even want to be in contention but after the Championship League, I
didn’t expect the pockets to be so big, and the centuries were flying in for
everyone."6811Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingPostpublished at 21:37 British Summer Time 27 April21:37 BST 27 AprilTrump 9-6 MurphyStephen HendrySeven-time world champion on BBC FourEverybody knew about it and what was going on. He'll be so glad it's done.He's world number one so he can do it, but he's now got to switch off and switch on to win this last frame. That's what the best players do.He's got to refocus when he comes back into the arena, win this last frame of the session and get a four-frame lead going into tomorrow.815Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingPostpublished at 21:34 British Summer Time 27 April21:34 BST 27 AprilTrump 9-6 MurphyJohn Parrott1991 world champion on BBC FourWell done Judd Trump. That is some achievement.Snooker from the gods. You can't play better than this. The past two frames have been of the highest order.As our colleague Michael pointed out earlier, it's only the third time in history that a player has made 100 centuries in a season. Judd has done it twice.14622Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingTrump makes 100th century of the season!published at 21:32 British Summer Time 27 April21:32 BST 27 AprilBreakingTrump 9-6 MurphyThere it is!

He made 98 in frame eight, 89 in frame 10, 97 in frame 12 before a 106 in frame 14.That takes Trump to 99 centuries for the season, one away from the £100,000 bonus for making 100 100s.Only two players have made done that in one campaign - Neil Robertson in 2013-14 with 103 and Trump himself with 102 in 2019-20.Here is the updated top 10 of most century breaks in one season:
      Neil Robertson (2013-14) 103

He had to work so hard with the cue ball. He can play shots other players can't because of his immense cue power.I'd love to have that sound of the ball cracking the leather at the back of the pocket as my message tone.For Shaun, it's a case of one step forward and two back. He can't get any momentum in this match, in terms of winning bunches of frames.296Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingprevious pagePage 1 of 8123456…8next pageHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright © 2025 BBC.
