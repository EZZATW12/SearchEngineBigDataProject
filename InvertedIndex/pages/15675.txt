"People might worry about the future but I'm not."The phrase 'I told you so' springs to mind.'Everybody now sees what Slot is capable of'  - Zendenpublished at 12:0512:05Image source, Getty ImagesFormer Liverpool midfielder Bolo Zenden says Arne Slot turned around criticism  with "beautiful football" and "charisma". He is delighted that everybody now sees what the boss can achieve. "I think no one expected him to actually do what he did with his staff and his players," Zenden told BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast."In the beginning people were thinking someone's coming in from the Mickey Mouse league and what's he going to do at Liverpool? Very soon he turned around the criticism with beautiful football, with charisma and I think everybody now sees what he's capable of doing. The most interesting thing is probably still to come."I'm sure he's not going to sit still. It's strange to talk about when you've just won the league but I'm sure that in the back of his mind he's already planning for next season."Is Gravenberch Slot's 'masterstroke'?published at 11:5911:59This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Former Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy says the Reds have had the best defender in the Premier League in Virgil van Dijk and the best striker in Mohamed Salah.He also believes Ryan Gravenberch deserves to be recognised as the best midfielder, describing the 22-year-old's reinvention into a holding player as Arne Slot's "masterstroke".And when the stats are weighed up, it is hard to argue against him.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Stats compared to other defensive and central midfielders11:15'It feels real now!'

The quality of football from each player, they were hungry and the mindset was to show why we are champions. And they did!Karen: Wow. So many emotions but never doubted this incredible team.

I'm 78 and proud to be a fan, win or lose, as we do have the best supporters in the world. 21 titles next year.John: This was such a joy to watch.

Yesterday was such an incredible day and memories made that will last a lifetime with our LFC familyImage caption, Andrew: The Spurs goal settled them down in what they needed to do. Once Luis Diaz equalised (VAR poetic judgement for 2023) it was the consummate professional performance with a glut of goals. Wonderful times. Wonderful celebrations.Jo: It's going to be a wild victory parade. I've been planning on what sandwiches to take for several months. That's confidence. So proud of the team. So happy for us fans. There's nothing like hearing YNWA at Anfield. The emotion was summed up in Virgil's face as it was sung at the end. He didn't want to let us down. Along with Slot and the rest of the squad, he's given his all for this title. Deeply appreciated by all Liverpool fans. Thank you.Image caption, Gregor: Fantastic team spirit throughout the season. Liverpool eternal heartbeat - and non-alcohol from Austria!Liverpool's Premier League title in numberspublished at 09:1809:18Liverpool's Premier League title has been impressive, but here is how it stacks up in the best of the stats...Liverpool's second Premier League title is their 20th English top-flight title overall, moving them level with Manchester United as the joint-most.The Reds have guaranteed their Premier League title with four games remaining – only three sides have ever been confirmed winners with more matches left to play and Liverpool themselves hold the record of seven in 2019-20.Arne Slot is the fourth manager to win the English top-flight title in his first season as Liverpool manager, after Matt McQueen (1922-23), Joe Fagan (1983-84), and Kenny Dalglish (1985-86).Slot is the first Dutchman to manage a side to the title in England, making the Netherlands the 10th nation to win in this country. They are also the first new nationality since Liverpool won in 2019-20 under German Jurgen Klopp.Like Slot, Virgil van Dijk is the first Dutch player to captain a side to the English top-flight title. It is only the second time that the Premier League has been won by a side whose manager and captain were from the same nation, after Arsenal in 2003-04 under a French head coach (Arsene Wenger) and captain (Patrick Vieira).Liverpool have led the league for the vast majority of the Premier League season – including today, the Reds have ended 207 days top of the table in 2024-25, 166 more than any other side.Liverpool's title has been spearheaded by the best attacking record in the Premier League this season - the graphic below shows all the metrics where they rank first.The most important part of this Reds attack has been Mohamed Salah. The winger leads the Premier League rankings for both goals (28) and assists (18) in 2024-25.Only two players have recorded more goal involvements in a season in the competition than his 46, both of which came in 42-game campaigns (Alan Shearer and Andy Cole - 47).'An unbelievable start' for Slotpublished at 07:4807:48Image source, Getty ImagesLiverpool boss Arne Slot "must be in dreamland" and now has a "wonderful platform" to build from after the Reds' Premier League title win, says former midfielder Danny Murphy.The Reds' 5-1 win over Tottenham on Sunday saw them confirmed as the 2024-25 champions and secured Slot the league title in his first season in charge.It is Liverpool's 20th top flight trophy - equalling the record of rivals Manchester United - and their first since 2019-20 under Jurgen Klopp."It's a phenomenal first season - so much to admire," Murphy told BBC Sport. "Slot has ingratiated himself with the fans quickly. They took to him – obviously easier when you're winning games of course."The way he conducts himself, the knowledge, the wisdom. It's things like the game at Old Trafford where he was talking about tactics and what they planned to do to win the game. There are so many little details that he has. He obviously loves the game and knows the game."There are so many things that they've done that's worked for them, so many things to like. That's a great platform for them to now go and build on."Following in the footsteps of Klopp was never going to be an easy task, but Slot could not have asked for much more from his first campaign at the helm - winning the title, reaching the final of the Carabao Cup and quarter-finals of the Champions League."He's probably had an easier ride than he ever anticipated because he would have envisaged some hiccups, and there haven't really been many," Murphy added."He has given himself a wonderful platform where the fans are on board. They've loved what they've seen - they like him, they're singing his name and they're eulogising about him."It's all positive. He must be in dreamland, honestly."It's just an unbelievable start for him. Let's be perfectly honest about this, the most ardent Liverpool fans and pundits – and I'm one of them – never envisaged a league title this year after Klopp leaving, and making one signing. "It's just incredible."Catch up on the Premier League actionpublished at 07:4407:44Highlights and analysis from Sunday's two Premier League fixtures, plus the best of the action from the rest of the weekend.If you missed Match of the Day 2, catch up now on BBC iPlayer.And you can watch Saturday's Match of the Day here.Listen back to the weekend's full match commentaries on BBC Sounds:Bournemouth 1-1 Manchester UnitedLiverpool 5-1 TottenhamThe party continues - Monday's reactionpublished at 07:4207:42Image source, Daily Express and GuardianSunk in yet?Liverpool are Premier League champions and you get to celebrate every single moment of it.At the heart of it at Anfield on Sunday was head coach Arne Slot, who has not only  made the so-called impossible task of succeeding Jurgen Klopp look so easy, but also managed to equal Manchester United's tally of 20 top-flight titles.It is a special time to be a Red.Image source, Daily Star and IGossip: Reds interested in forward optionspublished at 07:4107:41Liverpool, West Ham, Newcastle United, Manchester United, Tottenham and Chelsea are all interested in signing Canada striker Jonathan David, 25, when his Lille contract expires in the summer - but Marseille are hoping to persuade the player to stay in France.

He has a different approach compared to Klopp - and OK it was all set up ready for him with such a great team - but he has stamped his own style on the side. Liverpool cruised like a luxury liner to the Premier League title with such ease and aplomb. Let's believe they can carry it on in the future, being not the same as but close to Bill Shankly's Liverpool of the 1970s.Daniel: Waited my whole life to celebrate this with fellow Scousers!
