So I contaminated him with an egg," Eubank posted on social media with a clip of the incident.What information do we collect from this quiz?Media conference boils over & Hearn in firing lineThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, 'I felt that was the fair thing to do' - Eubank on Benn egg slapEubank made a slow entrance and demanded Benn be seated closer to him."I don't know who you think you're talking to," responded a twitchy Benn, dressed in a black silk pyjama-like outfit.The fighters belittled each other's records, Eubank spoke about the injustice of a rehydration clause which means he cannot weigh more than 10lb more than the middleweight limit on fight night, and Benn said he would "render [Eubank] unconscious"."I'm excited to end this man's career," said 28-year-old Benn, who has won all 23 of his fights, with 14 stoppages.With 34 wins in a career spanning more than 13 years, Eubank, 35, has fought at a significantly higher level. His losses have come against former world champions Billy Joe Saunders, George Groves and Liam Smith."I'm going to beat him because I'm a better fighter in every department," he said.Eubank and Benn have reignited a family rivalry after their hall-of-fame fathers fought for a second time almost 32 years ago.Eubank Sr was not in attendance, however, and appears reluctant to be involved in the promotion of the fight."The bottom line is that his dad does not even like him," said Benn.As the war of words continued, Nigel Benn and Eubank's team, including promoter Ben Shalom, remained quiet.But Eubank took particular aim at Benn's promoter, Eddie Hearn, who refused to back down."This is not the Eddie Hearn show," he said, talking over Hearn every time the Matchroom chairman spoke as a standoff ensued.Image gallerySkip image galleryImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Chris Eubank brings an egg out of pocket while facing off against Conor BennImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Eubank then slaps Benn across the face with the eggImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The egg cracks across Benn's face...Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, ...leaking down his jacketImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Yolk drips from Benn's forehead as security intervene1 of 5Previous imageNext imageSlide 1 of 5, Chris Eubank holds an egg in his hand before slapping Conor Benn across the face with it, Chris Eubank brings an egg out of pocket while facing off against Conor BennEnd of image galleryMore security needed for Thursday? – AnalysisThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, This Eubank fight is one for the British public - BennIt is unlikely the Manchester Central Auditorium - which usually caters for corporate events - has seen such histrionics.Benn v Eubank is a bloodline rivalry which has transitioned into bona-fide hatred. Put these two volatile Englishmen together in any room and the chances of it kicking off are extremely high.Asked by BBC Sport before the media conference what he thought of his opponent, Benn - without hesitation - replied: "Idiot."We expected a push or maybe some insults which crossed the line, but Eubank's actions caught everybody by surprise.The pair are set to face off again at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Thursday. The security firm used by organisers may need to call on a few more staff.Related topicsBoxingBoxing schedule and results 2025Published1 day agoWatch every Born to Brawl episodePublished28 April 2024More boxing from the BBCNotifications, social media and more with BBC SportPublished31 JanuaryComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 268Top storiesLive. Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win - latest & reaction8924 viewing8.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published15 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished47 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
