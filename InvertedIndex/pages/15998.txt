I have a good match with this
course and I was really looking forward to to the race."We had a super strong
field. It was perfect weather for me, I like when it's warm. The crowd were
really loud which helped."I had a good men's group ahead of me and they pushed
me really hard. So that was a lot of fun."On avoiding the men's racers: "That was tricky. Maybe it would be easier if we
started one minute after the men because there were many bends when it was
quite narrow."Of course, everybody wanted to take the same line but we're
not allowed to draft so it was quite tricky to not draft them so I had to
slalom."111Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRecap: Debrunner and Hug make it Swiss doublepublished at 14:49 British Summer Time 27 April14:49 BST 27 AprilImage source, PA MediaCatherine Debrunner broke her own course record as she and Marcel Hug made it a Swiss double for the second year running in the London Marathon wheelchair races.Debrunner finished in a time of one hour 34 minutes 18 seconds, more than four minutes quicker than her previous best in London three years ago and just two seconds outside her world record time.Fellow Paralympic champion Hug surged to his seventh victory in London - and fifth in a row - in 1:25:25.Great Britain's eight-time winner David Weir finished sixth and Eden Rainbow-Cooper was the top Briton in the women's race as she crossed the line in fourth.120Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRecap: Dominant Assefa wins women's racepublished at 14:47 British Summer Time 27 April14:47 BST 27 AprilThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Assefa sets women's-only marathon world recordTigst Assefa won the women's race earlier, crossing the line in a world record time for a women's-only race.She was side-by-side with Joyciline Jepkosgei for much of the race but pulled clear in the closing stages it what was ultimately a convincing win.Eilish McColgan, on her marathon debut, was eighth.310Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharing'I knew my first one would be tough'published at 14:45 British Summer Time 27 April14:45 BST 27 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesEilish McColgan, who finished eighth on her marathon debut: "I was very, very nervous. Probably the most nervous I have been. The distance was an unknown. I have never raced more than a half marathon so I thought of doing it back-to-back was scary. The crowds were insane."On whether she will do another marathon: "If you asked me just after I would have said absolutely not but now I have had time to think it was an incredible experience. I knew my first one would be tough. I was coming in underprepared. I can now call myself a marathoner which I was incredibly proud of. It was a really good learning experience." On her mum, Liz, who won the London Marathon in 1996: "I have spoken to her very briefly. Every time I run I feel I am doing it for my mum and family. It is different generation from her time. I have super shoes and gels and all sorts. It is really special."I would love to break two minutes 20 seconds. It is what I think I am capable of doing. I will make some tweaks in training. There will definitely be more marathons in the future. Hopefully there can another before the end of the year."705Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingPostpublished at 14:44 British Summer Time 27 April14:44 BST 27 AprilMore fancy dress content because there's definitely no such thing as too much on London marathon day!Image source, PA MediaImage source, PA MediaImage source, PA MediaImage source, PA Media261Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharing'Brutal but amazing'published at 14:41 British Summer Time 27 April14:41 BST 27 AprilSeven-time Olympic cycling champion Jason Kenny has completed his first London Marathon and has been speaking to Gabby Logan on BBC One."It was absolutely amazing.
