Same old 'Ange-ball' nonsense. Time to go. You can succeed in Scotland, where there are mostly two teams, but you can't in the Premier League. We probably won't win the Europa league either - we are simply not good enough. Massive clearout required in the close season, including the management because this season has been an embarrassment.Chester: Not a decent tackler in midfield, awful distribution from the back, every challenge across the pitch lost and one header won in the whole game. Can we win a trophy? If you think you can change all of that in four days, you would be regarded as delusional.Doug: We are a disgrace. All this focus on Europa League, but we can't beat the likes of Wolves and Ipswich - and we get humiliated by Liverpool three times in a season. We can't defend, we can't pass and I've got no idea what is going on in training. Ange needs to go regardless of whether we win the Europa League or not.George: This was expected - we shouldn't make it out like it wasn't. Ange should be given the chance to win us the Europa League. If we manage to win it, give him next season to prove himself under normal conditions. We are in bad form in the league, just like any other team has been in the past, and it is a mindset issue not a management issue. A fresh start next season with a potential European trophy under our belts sounds a lot more promising.Dan: It's gone way past the time for Ange to go. Honestly, how long do we have to put up with this for? The players don't seem to care or show any fight.

They're worthy champions – they've been outstanding all year. It was really hard for us. They proved to be too good."We were going to face a highly motivated team and so it proved. We started the game OK and tried to make it as hard as possible. We're making a lot of changes to our team on a weekly basis. It's affecting our fluency and consistency, and we're paying the price for that."In the first half, what was really disappointing was the manner in which we conceded the goals. I thought we were actually well in the game and had our moments going forward. Once they went in front it was really difficult, with the crowd behind them, to get back into the game."In the games we've been blown away by Liverpool, we've been fairly depleted. We've obviously rested a few, which I think we needed. The lads who played have come through OK, which is what we needed."On the Europa League semi-final on Thursday: "There's a massive opportunity. We'll put all our energies, efforts and focus into that and try to push on to a European final."Liverpool 5-1 Tottenham: Did you know?published at 20:13 27 April20:13 27 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesTottenham Hotspur have lost their 19th game of the season, their joint-most defeats in a Premier League campaign along with the 1993-94 and 2003-04 seasons.This defeat by Liverpool was the joint-heaviest Spurs have suffered in the league under Ange Postecoglou and guarantees that they will finish a top-flight season in the bottom half for the first time since 2007-08 (11th).20:00 27 AprilLiverpool clinch Premier League title with thumping win over Spurs, published at 20:00 27 AprilLiverpool clinch Premier League title with thumping win over SpursAttributionPremier LeagueComments212419:49 27 AprilSpurs struggled after 'decent start' - Postecoglou.

And are you now worried about Thursday's huge Europa League semi-final?Let us knowCome back to this page on Monday to find a selection of your repliesFollow Sunday's Premier League games livepublished at 13:03 27 April13:03 27 AprilTwo matches make up Sunday's Premier League action and BBC Sport will bring you every kick.Bournemouth v Man Utd (14:00) - follow all the action hereLiverpool v Tottenham (16:30) - follow all the action hereAll kick-off times BSTListen to live commentary of both games on BBC Radio 5 LiveSutton's predictions: Liverpool v Tottenhampublished at 12:18 27 April12:18 27 AprilLiverpool only need a point to make sure of the title, and it is going to happen against Tottenham on Sunday.There is an argument that Spurs, and Manchester United too, should go strong in these Premier League games to try to find the rhythm they have been lacking all season, and get the team playing the way we know they can to help them in their Europa League semi-finals.But I don't see Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou doing that before his side play Bodo/Glimt on Thursday, and I can only see one outcome.Liverpool have hardly been that sharp of late but they will be determined to win the title in front of their own fans for the first time in 35 years.They were not able to do that when they last won the title in 2020 because of the Covid regulations at the time, so doing it now is a big deal for them.I am expecting them to raise their game and blow Spurs away to get the job done.Sutton's prediction: 4-1Read the full predictions and have your say hereWhy Spurs' miserable Anfield record is a tad misleadingpublished at 16:01 26 April16:01 26 AprilJoe BradshawBBC Sport Senior JournalistThe title is won - or so the prevailing wisdom seems to be.Liverpool simply need turn up against Tottenham on Sunday and red ribbons will be applied to the Premier League trophy.In many ways, it is a fair assumption.Anfield has not been a happy hunting ground for Spurs.It is 14 years since Rafael van der Vaart and Luka Modric inspired the north London side to victory there, as Liverpool stuttered under Sir Kenny Dalglish.Since then, it has been one joyful result after another for the Reds.Even this season, trailing 1-0 from the Carabao Cup semi-final first leg at Tottenham, Liverpool simply steamrollered their visitors, utterly untouched in a 4-0 procession to the final.And that was just six weeks after smashing Spurs 6-3 at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in the Premier League.Then there is the Arsenal factor. Delaying Liverpool's coronation would only help Tottenham's bitterest rivals. And no Spurs fan wants that, surely?The graph below underlines just how much more success Liverpool have had points-wise than Tottenham in this fixture.However, for those who like a bit of jeopardy,... despite the stats, Liverpool have not had it all their own way against Tottenham on home turf.For the past two seasons, they have hosted Spurs at this time of year and hit four in both games - but also been leaky at the other end.Indeed, Richarlison famously thought he had rescued a point in the 93rd minute in 2023, only for Diogo Jota to ruin away hopes.In 2022, it was a May match - and Antonio Conte's side dealt a significant blow to Liverpool's title hopes with a 1-1 draw at Anfield.During the Covid-affected season before, Roberto Firmino scored in injury time to nick a win for Liverpool and deny Spurs a deserved point.And that's just the past five seasons.Who can forget Victor Wanyama's ridiculous strike and Harry Kane's late penalty to grab a point in an enthralling 2-2 draw in 2018?Or a crucial winner from Mario Balotelli in a 3-2 thriller in 2015?In other words, games against Tottenham are usually a pretty wild ride - but with the right outcome as far as Liverpool are concerned.So buckle in for Sunday's title opportunity. It is perhaps not as straightforward as it seems...The answerpublished at 16:55 25 April16:55 25 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesEarlier, we asked you to name the current Tottenham player from a series of clues.The correct answer is Djed Spence.Romero's future 'not important' right nowpublished at 16:15 25 April16:15 25 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesTottenham boss Ange Postecoglou has insisted he is not thinking about the future of Cristian Romero or any other player at the club as he instead focuses on the Europa League.Romero, whose contract expires in June 2027, made headlines after saying he "would love" to play in La Liga in response to links with Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid.But Postecoglou said: "I haven't read the report too closely, but it's like me - if you get asked a question, you have got to answer it."If you ask me a lot of questions about my future, you'd probably get some great headlines out of that as well, but it doesn't change [anything]."Do you know what's important right now? It is not Cristian Romero's future or anyone else's future, it is that we have an unbelievable opportunity to do something special at this football club and, for me and everyone involved internally, that is what we're concentrating on."Let's put our heads down and make sure, because I think, for our supporters, that is the most important thing to them. Right now, all they care about is that we're in the last four of a European competition and we want to do something special. That is where our focus is."Postecoglou was also quizzed on his previous support of Liverpool, who will win the Premier League title if they avoid defeat by Spurs at Anfield on Sunday.However, Postecoglou said: "I'm an almost 60-year-old adult. I've gone past my boyhood crushes, so it's got no impact whatsoever."I have great admiration for the football club. Yes, I supported it when I was younger, but that was 50-odd years ago, so we've well and truly moved on since then."You want to go there and compete against obviously a very good side - and compete well."Why Spurs could struggle at Anfieldpublished at 15:44 25 April15:44 25 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesTottenham struggle against teams who press.Spurs go to Anfield on Sunday knowing that they could upset a potential title party, with Liverpool needing only a point to be confirmed as 2024-25 Premier League champions.Arne Slot's team, while not as gung-ho as Jurgen Klopp's previous iteration of the Reds, focus a lot on pressing their opponents and could scarcely have chosen a better side to play on Sunday for this reason.Only Manchester United and Southampton have been turned over in their own third more so far in the 2024-25 Premier League season than Tottenham.Ange Postecoglou's team have faced 291 high turnovers, with United facing 292 and the Saints 308.Spurs also have the fourth-highest xG against stat in the league (54.3). Only relegated sides Southampton and Leicester, and 18th-placed Ipswich, have bigger values in this category.Liverpool talisman Mohamed Salah has also contributed to 20 goals against Tottenham - his third highest total against an opponent, behind Manchester United (22) and Manchester City (21).Salah has scored 15 and assisted five in just 23 matches versus Spurs.Postecoglou on Son, team selection and Europa League 'opportunity'published at 14:26 25 April14:26 25 AprilSean ByrneBBC Sport researcherTottenham boss Ange Postecoglou has been speaking to the media before Sunday's Premier League game at Liverpool (kick-off 16:30 BST).Here are the key lines from his news conference:On injury news: "Don't really have injury problems - only one. Sonny [Son Heung-min] is the one trying to work his way back. He's improving, which is good for us - but not for Sunday."On when Son can be expected back: "We'll see. He's improving. First time on the grass today and it's better then it was. It's day by day now."On team selection: "Apart from the long-term injuries, everyone from the last game is back really well. Rest of the squad is available."On facing Liverpool on Sunday before Europa League semi-final first leg against Bodo/Glimt on Thursday: "We want to go there and compete well against Liverpool. Irrespective of what's on the horizon, that is the primary importance to us."On managing fan expectation: "You've just got to deal with what's before you. We are well aware our league form and position is nowhere near good enough. We also know there is an unbelievable opportunity on the horizon. This clubs had many seasons when it has done outstandingly well in the league but doesn't have the opportunity we have now being in the final four of a major competition. That's where the focus is and where the focus should be."Follow all of Friday's Premier League news conferences and the rest of the day's football newsToday's trivia challengepublished at 08:54 25 April08:54 25 AprilGuess the current Tottenham player from these three clues:I won promotion to the Premier League while on loan at Nottingham Forest in 2022.Since joining Tottenham, I have had loan spells playing in France and Italy.I scored in the Carabao Cup win at Coventry earlier this season.Come back to this page at 17:00 BST for the answerGossip: Spurs interested in Rashfordpublished at 07:54 25 April07:54 25 AprilTottenham Hotspur will begin negotiations over a new contract for Argentina defender Cristian Romero, 26, who is being monitored by Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid.

Read Friday's full gossip column Follow the gossip column on BBC SportSupporters group set to up protests at next Spurs home gamepublished at 15:33 23 April15:33 23 AprilNizaar KinsellaBBC Sport football news reporterImage source, Getty ImagesThe Change for Tottenham protest group are planning "to visibly signal dissatisfaction" with events in north London at the next home game against Crystal Palace by not taking their seats for the beginning of the second half. The move is the latest escalation of an ongoing protest movement by a growing fringe supporters group that aims to put pressure on Daniel Levy and the wider Enic ownership group, featuring the Lewis family trust.They say that the club needs to stop putting "profit before glory" and supporters will repeat their protests from recent matches against Liverpool, Manchester United and Southampton by gathering before kick-off and marching to the stadium. Fans are also encouraged to wear yellow. Spurs have held multiple rounds of consultation with various fan groups - including Change for Tottenham - to listen to their concerns. In Tottenham's account, released at the end of March, Levy stated: "Since opening our new stadium in April 2019, we have invested over £700 million net in player acquisitions. "Recruitment remains a key focus, and we must ensure that we make smart purchases within our financial means. I often read calls for us to spend more, given that we are ranked as the ninth richest club in the world. "However, a closer examination of today's financial figures reveals that such spending must be sustainable in the long term and within our operating revenues. "Our capacity to generate recurring revenues determines our spending power. We cannot spend what we do not have, and we will not compromise the financial stability of this club."Spurs have spent £214.8m on manager Ange Postecoglou's squad, with the most recent arrivals signed in January - forward Mathys Tel, defender Kevin Danso and goalkeeper Antonin Kinsky.But there were also noticeably empty seats in some sections of the stadium on Monday as Spurs lost 2-1 at home to Nottingham Forest. It comes amid the backdrop of a season which could be the club's worst in the Premier League era. After 33 games, Spurs are 16th on 37 points having lost 18 matches. They need to pick up eight more points to surpass their worst total in a single Premier League campaign, which came in the 1997-98 season, under a combination of Gerry Francis and Christian Gross as permanent managers. And they also need to avoid a further two defeats to avoid breaking the record 19 defeats suffered that season. At the moment, Spurs are five matches without a win at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in the league and have already suffered more defeats (eight) on home turf than they had in any other 38-game season. Because of these struggles, manager Ange Postecoglou is understood to be under some pressure when he faces a post-season review, regardless of whether Tottenham win the Europa League.Gossip: Candidates lined up to replace Postecogloupublished at 07:29 23 April07:29 23 AprilAnge Postecoglou is likely to leave Tottenham even if they win the Europa League and qualify for next season's Champions League.

Read Wednesday's full gossip column Follow the gossip column on BBC SportPostecoglou 'remains a man on borrowed time'published at 12:36 22 April12:36 22 AprilAli SpeechlyFan writerImage source, Getty ImagesAs the Ange Postecoglou rollercoaster rattles on, the Spurs manager remains a man on borrowed time.The high of last Thursday night's qualification into the semi finals of the Europa League was short-lived, with Spurs plummeting back to reality within the opening 16 minutes against Nottingham Forest on Monday.I can understand wanting to focus on the one competition which might deliver silverware for the first time since 2008, and needing to rest and rotate players to give us the best chance of winning this trophy.What I am less convinced by is how consecutive losses in the Premier League help us to prepare for victory in Europe.Where is the momentum? Where is the motivation? Where is the morale?We were not awful against Forest – or maybe I have just become numb to it now – but there are no prizes for the most crosses into the box.I am confused by Ange's decision to bench the likes of Solanke, Bergvall and Johnson – clearly to rest them – only to bring them on in the latter stages to salvage something from the game. Surely players expend more energy chasing the end of a game than they do by starting it and controlling at least the first half?Perhaps Ange had more faith in his revised starting 11 than he should have, and was forced into bringing on players who he would rather save for Liverpool and Europe.Either way, the Premier League feels like a necessary evil for Spurs right now. Less of a pleasure and more of a chore.If we can win the Europa League with a bang, I can forgive us ending the domestic season with a whimper.As for Ange, I think his ride with us will be over soon regardless.Find more from Ali Speechly at Women Of The Lane, external and on  Instagram, external'His arrogance is beyond belief' - the fans' verdictpublished at 08:56 22 April08:56 22 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesWe asked for your thoughts after Tottenham fell to a 2-1 defeat against Nottingham Forest on Monday.Here are some of your comments:Rich: Woeful yet again. All huff and puff yet we get the same result. Ange Postecoglou is appalling and way out of his depth. Week in, week out we are getting worse. This is an unacceptable season for a Spurs team, and his arrogance is beyond belief. We are so much better than this!Stewart: Expected. We are saving our best for Europa League. Just like Manchester United's loss to Wolves, it means nothing.Roger: We no longer look like a team. We look like a bunch of individuals, with each player trying to do it all on their own. When we attack, everyone takes too many touches while the others stand and watch. We don't defend as a unit, and time and again Pedro Porro's poor defending has cost us a goal. Richarlison's ability up front is almost matched by the lack of real quality from our other forwards. There is something fundamentally wrong with the coaching.Henry: We just need a bit more self confidence and focus from the lads, but other than that I think we did all right. Ange has just had an unlucky year with injuries and the squad now lacks any of the confidence it previously had. Our substitutes need to make more of an impact and somebody needs to step up as a leader because Son Heung-min hasn't turned up all season. However, credit to Mathys Tel and Wilson Odobert, who took their men on and pretty much provided all of our chances against an organised Forest team.Stephen: Ange needs to explain his team selection and substitutes, especially at half-time. For the first time, I thought his selection smacked of desperation or the 'I just don't care' mentality. Sadly, I think he knows he is toast and has given up.Laura: Please someone put us out of our misery. It is the hope that kills you. That was one of the most frustrating performances I've seen as a Spurs fan. We couldn't get a break - but having good strikers would help! Most fans want the season finished already.'A loss that for large parts was self-inflicted' - Postecogloupublished at 07:16 22 April07:16 22 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesTottenham manager Ange Postecoglou to BBC Match of the Day: "It's disappointing. Another disappointing loss. A loss that, for large parts, was self-inflicted."We conceded two poor goals and gave ourselves a a mountain to climb. I still think we didn't deserve to lose on the balance of play."Our football was good, there's no denying that. We created loads of opportunities, we had them pegged in. But it was really disappointing to concede the two goals like we did."It's hurt us all year. We've let ourselves down. It's a game we should have won and it's another one this year. There shouldn't have been a slow start."From our perspective, there was some good game time for the guys that needed it. We were able to rest a few and that will help us."We have to accept the fact we haven't been at the level we should be. I don't like losing - we've lost too many games. We've got to keep working and try to rectify these things so the football we play gets the results it deserves."Did you know?Spurs have lost 18 Premier League games in 2024-25 under Postecoglou - only Ossie Ardiles in 1993-94 (19) has more defeats as Tottenham manager across a season in the competition.previous pagePage 1 of 38123456…38next pageHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright © 2025 BBC.
