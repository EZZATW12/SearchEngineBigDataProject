For that reason, he hit me and Morbidelli overtook me from the other side."Luckily for both of us, we stayed on the bike."Alex Marquez, who led the MotoGP standings heading to Qatar, was penalised for making contact with Fabio di Giannantonio in a separate incident and eventually ended seventh on the road - rising to sixth after Vinales' penalty.Reigning world champion Jorge Martin, taking part in his first race weekend of the 2025 season, crashed out midway through the race.The Spaniard suffered fractures to his hand and foot in a crash during pre-season testing.Related topicsMotorsportTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8860 viewing8.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
