I am really, very happy," Assefa told BBC One."Last year I did have some problems with the cold and my hamstring tightened up towards the end. This year the weather suited me better."I am really pleased with how the race went."The field for the men's elite race was touted as the best ever in London and the lead group was still comprised of nine athletes after 30km (18.64 miles).Sawe made his move just after the 31km (19.26 miles) mark and although the competition included Kiplimo, Mutiso, four-time winner Eliud Kipchoge and Olympic champion Tamirat Tola, none could match him.The Kenyan stretched his lead and eventually crossed the line a minute and 10 seconds ahead of his nearest challengers."I am so happy. This is my fastest time for the London Marathon," he told BBC One."I was well prepared for this race and that is why it is an honour for me to have won."Related topicsAthleticsMore on this storyWhat is Couch to 5k and how do I start?Published3 days agoArrests over paint thrown on London Marathon routePublished21 hours agoComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 213Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9803 viewing9.8k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished35 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
