At the beginning of the week you are thinking about training and those kind of things."But the feeling gets stronger now. That is why I'm a little bit late now [for the news conference], because I wanted to say goodbye to some people personally and take time for them, more than just shaking hands."I understand that good results help, but it is very nice to feel that people really are thinking it's a pity that I'm leaving."Slot's final game at Feyenoord after three years in charge will be Sunday's Eredivisie home match with Excelsior. Klopp's time at Liverpool ends on the same day with a home Premier League game against Wolves.Feyenoord confirmed the 45-year-old's departure on social media, saying: "The Arne Slot era is coming to an end.
