Carys Cox had a sniff of the tryline on her wing, but was well marshalled by Kildunne.Wales kept asking questions but their attack was thwarted by a superb Sadia Kabeya turnover. It should have been an easy clearance for Zoe Harrison, but she knocked on behind her own line and gifted Wales a 5m scrum.It proved costly as Georgia Evans picked up from the base and drove to within inches of the line, with Scoble quick to recycle and crash over.True to form, England did not take long to respond. Abby Dow, returning after breaking her hand, put a kick through which put the covering Lisa Neumann under pressure. Feaunati took the line-out ball before handing off Abbie Fleming and charging to the line.The second try fell to Cardiff-born Jones, who scooped up a loose ball in the midfield before beating three defenders on her way to score.Sarah Bern was in shortly after, England had overthrown the line-out but managed to retain possession and nice hands from Feaunati put the prop in under the posts.The bonus-point was wrapped up before the break when England drove Wales off the scrum and the ball came out to Breach, who fed Feaunati in the corner.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Scoble's try for Wales stuns EnglandLynn made half-time changes, bringing on Donna Rose and Kelsey Jones in the front row in a bid to compete more in the physical battle.And the team talk looked to have inspired as Wales once again started the half brightly, but England gave a lesson on how to be clinical as the tries came raining down in Cardiff.The pick was the first from Kildunne, who latched on to a looping ball out wide from Harrison to cross in the corner.She was back in on the opposite corner five minutes later before dotting down for her hat-trick. She left the field to rapturous applause before being deservedly named player of the match.A chance then fell to Wales who showed the fight and passion that Lynn had asked for all week. Despite being shoved off their own scrum, the ball came out to Cox who managed to offload to Kate Williams, crossing to give the home crowd something to cheer.The final 10 minutes became the Abi show, with Dow and Burton both crossing for two tries apiece as Wales looked in danger of a record loss to their rivals.But the whistle went to spare Wales as they continue to build under new management.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, 'What a run' - Jones grabs England's second try against WalesWales head coach Sean Lynn said: "We have to remember we're playing against the best team in the world."We have to get better, every game we've got to be getting better. We've got France, Ireland and Italy left, and we've got to keep getting better and better. Simple."I was asking them 'how hard are they willing to fight for each other' and they certainly showed they could today."England head coach John Mitchell said: "We didn't start particularly well, but we grew into the second half and built some good pressure."I'm really glad the way we responded to what Wales did to us."I think we're a side that can't afford to get bored with the basics, because when our basics are poor that lets us down and brings the opposition into the game."Wales: Joyce-Butchers; Neumann, H Jones (capt), Powell, Cox, George, Bevan; G Pyrs, Phillips, Scoble, Fleming, Crabb, Williams, Lewis, Evans.Replacements: K Jones, M Davies, Rose, A Pyrs, King, M Davies, C Keight, N Metcalfe.England: Kildunne; Dow, Jones, Heard, Breach; Harrison, Hunt; Carson, Atkin-Davies, Bern, Talling, Ward, Aldcroft (capt), Kabeya, Feaunati.Replacements: Cokayne, Botterman, Muir, Galligan, Burton, L Packer, Aitchison, Rowland.Related topicsWelsh RugbyRugby UnionEnglish RugbyComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 551Top storiesLive. Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win - latest & reaction11672 viewing12k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published15 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished56 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
