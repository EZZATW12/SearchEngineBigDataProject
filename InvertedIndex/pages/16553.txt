Six NationsFrance: (21) 42Tries: Boulard 2, Bigot, Feleu, Champon, Penalty Cons: Bourgeois 5 Wales: (12) 12Tries: Williams, Crabb Con: Bevan France remain on course for a Grand Slam decider against England after overcoming a dogged Welsh side in Brive.Emilie Boulard was back in the line-up and back in the tries as she crossed twice, while Wales hit back through Kate Williams and Gwen Crabb.Manon Bigot's score on the stroke of half-time gave the hosts a 21-12 lead, with Wales still very much in the contest.But France's class shone through as they pulled away with efforts from Manae Feleu, Lea Champon and a penalty try.Wales' wait for a first win under new head coach Sean Lynn goes on, as does a first victory on French soil, but they can be encouraged by an improved performance.Six-time champions France go top of the Women's Six Nations table before England's visit to Ireland.Despite 13 hours of disrupted travel on Friday, Wales showed little signs of fatigue and got off to a bright start in front of a passionate 13,000 crowd, but it was the hosts who took the early lead.A driving maul off line-out ball drew in the Welsh defence which opened up acres of space for Carla Arbez to put in a cross-field kick for returning wing Boulard.Wales responded well in the drizzle and were gifted territory when Bigot was penalised for a high tackle on Jenni Scoble.With the tryline at their mercy, the forwards showed good patience before Williams crossed for her second try in as many games.France's second came towards the end of the first quarter, with their forwards making easy metres into the Welsh 22 before shipping the ball out wide to Boulard, who did well to gather the ball before diving over in the corner.Undeterred, Wales went straight back to the other end of the pitch and scored on only their second visit to the French 22, this time it was Crabb over from close range.France looked to have extended their lead with Rose Bernadou going over, but referee Holly Wood brought play back as the powerful prop knocked on in the grounding.Wales did their best to hold out the hosts until half-time, but Bigot crashed over from a well-worked line-out in the final play.Still it was a hugely encouraging 40 minutes from a side which had failed to score a single point in the last meeting with Les Bleues and who had never beaten France away.France pull awayThe first score after the break was always going to be pivotal and unfortunately for Wales it fell the way of the French.After a scrappy few minutes, the forwards reasserted their dominance, with co-captain Feleu crashing over to seal the bonus point.Despite the scoreboard moving out of sight, Wales continued to show bravery, with Carys Cox coming close after a storming run down her wing.Wales looked to be in shortly after with Courtney Keight finding a gap in the defence, but Abbie Fleming, who had barely put a foot wrong in the tournament, was shown to have caused obstruction in the prior line-out.Wales were then dealt a blow when fly-half Kayleigh Powell left the field for a head injury assessment, which saw Sian Jones come on at scrum-half and Keira Bevan move to 10.Fortunately she was able to return, which would come as a relief to Lynn with Lleucu George ruled out with a calf injury.The game grew fragmented with both sides emptying their benches, but France looked to have found their flow again just after the hour mark.A series of dominant scrums saw Wales concede a penalty try, with Maisie Davies sent to the sin-bin just a few minutes after coming on.France took advantage and rubbed salt in Welsh wounds with one final score in the dying minutes.It came the way of replacement scrum-half Champon, with the tournament's top point scorer Morgane Bourgeois rounding off a perfect day with the boot.France hooker Elisa Riffonneau said: "The first half was close but we just kept going and it was a good end, we are happy about the team performance today."We are building every game. We have a big game next week in Parma [against Italy], so we are focussing on that."We don't want to focus on England yet, after next week we will see."Wales head coach Sean Lynn said: "The girls felt really confident at half-time, the coaching staff too, and we've got to take that as a positive because you're coming out here in front of an amazing crowd, in an amazing stadium and we are competing with France."The wind was taken away from our sails with that disallowed try [in the second half], but we've got to learn how to get back control, how to get back into territory because we're getting in some really good areas."Overall, I asked for them to be brave and for work rate and that's what the girls did today."France: Morgane Bourgeois; Kelly Arbey, Marine Menager (co-capt), Montserrat Amedee, Emilie Boulard; Carla Arbez, Pauline Bourdon-Sansus; Yllana Brosseau, Manon Bigot, Rose Bernadou, Manae Feleu (co-capt), Madouddou Fall-Raclot, Charlotte Escudero, Seraphine Okemba, Teani Feleu.Replacements: Elisa Riffonneau, Ambre Mwayembe, Assia Khalfaoui, Kiara Zago, Axelle Berthoumieu, Lea Champon, Oceane Bordes, Lina Queyroi.Wales: Jasmine Joyce; Lisa Neumann, Hannah Jones (capt), Courtney Keight, Carys Cox; Kayleigh Powell, Keira Bevan; Gwenllian Pyrs, Carys Phillips, Jenni Scoble, Abbie Fleming, Gwen Crabb, Kate Williams, Bethan Lewis, Georgia Evans.Replacements: Kelsey Jones, Maisie Davies, Donna Rose, Natalia John, Alaw Pyrs, Bryonie King, Sian Jones, Nel Metcalfe.Referee: Holly Wood (RFU)Assistant referees: Sara Cox (RFU) & Maria Heitor (FPR)TMO: Leo Colgan (IRFU)FPRO: Rachel Horton (RA)Related topicsWelsh RugbyRugby UnionComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 87Top storiesLive. Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win - latest & reaction11672 viewing12k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published15 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished56 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
