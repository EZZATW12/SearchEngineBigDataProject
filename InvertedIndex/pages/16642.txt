That's all the information I have."No deadline but WRU want movement on new dealPublished2 days agoLock McNally signs new Cardiff contractPublished4 days agoSherratt hopes Cardiff players stay after WRU dealPublished17 AprilFaletau has been limited to just 21 appearances for Cardiff in three years since his move from Bath.A broken arm suffered in the 2023 World Cup was followed by a fractured shoulder on his club return in April 2024.But the 110-cap forward has said he has no intention of retiring and has been linked with a move to France.Sherratt has not hidden his admiration for the player, but he could be forced to let Faletau leave as the club cut their cloth following recent financial turmoil."He's one of the best that has ever pulled on the red of Wales and he was unbelievable [against Munster]," said Sherratt."We saw his full repertoire against Munster, his stepping, line breaks, timing of the pass and solid in defence. It was probably his best performance in a blue and black jersey."Image source, Huw Evans AgencyImage caption, Gabriel Hamer-Webb has scored four tries in his last two appearancesSherratt said the change in club ownership had delayed contract negotiations with certain players.Cardiff was taken over by the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) earlier this month when it went into administration.In some cases under existing contracts, Cardiff players are free to move on if they wish as their their deals can be deemed null and void because the region fell into administration.Budgets are still yet to be finalised, given there is still no signed agreement between the governing body and the other three regions.But the head coach was clear he wanted to keep Gabriel Hamer-Webb, another who is out of contract at the end of the season.The wing crossed against Munster - and set up another score - to take his club tally to 10 tries, including four in his last two games."What I was most pleased about is that he backed up last week's performance [at Judgement Day]," said Sherratt.Cardiff moved up to fifth in the United Rugby Championship on Friday to keep their play-off hopes alive."Nights like [Friday] certainly help with contract talks," said Sherratt, who was Wales interim coach for part of the Six Nations."It was a great occasion, the fans really got behind the team and there's a really strong group here."It wasn't long ago we only had 12 players training, we changed training base halfway through a season, there's been a change of ownership and we've lost about 1,800 caps of experience."The group had every excuse to ease off, but where we are now is a huge credit to everyone here."Related topicsWelsh RugbyCardiffWales SportRugby UnionComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 39Top storiesLive. Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win - latest & reaction10704 viewing11k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published15 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished57 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
