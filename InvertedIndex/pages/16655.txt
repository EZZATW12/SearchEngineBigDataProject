It underlines the WRU's commitment to grow the game at home, and we look forward to having discussions with the professional clubs in Wales and our educational establishments."The initial discussions that have taken place have recognised that this is a unique and exciting opportunity for Welsh rugby."Moore added: "From my personal experience across the border, the English clubs have recognised the value and commercial opportunities available in women's rugby."This will not be easy, and we expect to have detailed discussions around what support the WRU will provide and to scrutinise what the clubs who apply will offer the next generation of players in Wales."Moore also highlighted the achievements of university side Cardiff Met."Cardiff Met's recent fantastic success, beating Loughborough and being crowned Women's BUCS Super Rugby champions, included 10 players who played in the Celtic Challenge last season," said Moore."It underlines that Wales produces rugby talent, and we just need to provide that talent with the opportunity and a stage to develop and flourish."The new teams' coaches will be appointed by the WRU.The union added that successful bids to form the teams "will meet the operating standards set by the tournament organisers".For the last two campaigns, Brython Thunder played at Parc y Scarlets, while Gwalia Lightning switched between Cardiff Arms Park and Rodney Parade in their first season and at Ystrad Mynach in 2024-25.The WRU has set a deadline of Friday, 2 May for any expressions of interest in forming one of the new teams.Ospreys 'keen' to form women's teamOspreys chief executive Lance Bradley says they would be "keen" to form a women's team for the Celtic Challenge to play out at St Helen's, where Ospreys plan to play in 2025-26.He told S4C Chwaraeon: "I was at Gloucester when we revised our support for the Hartpury team, which has ended up with winning the championship for three years in a row so I've been passionate about women's rugby for a long time and we would love to have a women's team at St Helen's."Related topicsDragonsWelsh RugbyCardiffScarletsOspreysRugby UnionComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 21Top storiesLive. Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win - latest & reaction11110 viewing11k viewingLive. World Snooker Championship - live text6370 viewing6.4k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published15 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
