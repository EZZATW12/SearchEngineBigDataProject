"Sunday is like cup rugby. I'm looking for a response because the World Cup is all about pressure moments and you have to enjoy that and embrace it."Italy v Wales rearranged due to Pope's funeralPublished5 days agoWales' faith in coach Lynn will pay off - CoxPublished5 days ago'80-minute performance will come' for Wales - BevanPublished4 days agoLynn is likely to make changes for what is - just as last year's final game against Italy - a must-win match on Sunday.Wales were brushed aside by a rampant Ireland who made twice the number of carries, metres and linebreaks despite a shocking 25 handling errors which could have inflicted far more damage than the 40-14 scoreline suggests."I was disappointed, full-stop," added Lynn. "The performance against Ireland was not good enough and the players and staff are aware of that."We should have been far more competitive but you have to take your chances and you cannot concede 18 penalties against top sides."Most of those penalties were down to us and individuals trying to fix problems that weren't theirs to fix but resulted in putting the team under pressure."When we talk about learning from games, that was a massive area for us."Wales are awaiting the result of a scan on the hamstring of Harlequins fly-half Kayleigh Powell who was a late withdrawal last week.However, Lynn was at least relieved that his team were not forced to play two games in five days when the match - rearranged due to the funeral of Pope Francis - was pushed back to Sunday.Related topicsWelsh RugbyWales SportRugby UnionComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 53Top storiesLive. Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win - latest & reaction11110 viewing11k viewingLive. World Snooker Championship - live text6370 viewing6.4k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published15 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
