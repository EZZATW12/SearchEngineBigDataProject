"I have had lots of conversations with my family, friends and the coaches here, and feel like this is the right time to venture into a new challenge for myself and my family."I have enjoyed every second of playing here and have made friends and memories that will last a lifetime. This is a special place that has played a hugely important role in where I am as a player, and person, today."Elite professionalImage source, Huw Evans Picture AgencyImage caption, Adam Beard has played 58 times for Wales and one Test for the British and Irish LionsOspreys head coach Mark Jones says Beard will be missed and hopes the next generation of locks can fill the void.  "Beardy's influence has been ever present in his time at the Ospreys," said Jones."He will leave a big hole as a player, a set-piece expert and a leader."The Ospreys have historically placed a high importance on having a strong front five and he has been a key contributor in that for a long time. He's an elite professional but most of all, a great person."Jones added that while Beard's presence will be missed, Ospreys have "high hopes" for a number of younger locks at the region. "His departure will provide an opportunity for those boys, along with any new additions we have, to step up as leaders," he added. Wales captains Dewi Lake and Jac Morgan have signed new deals to stay at Ospreys next season, while Queensland Reds lock Ryan Smith and Brive flanker Ross Moriarty are set to join.Related topicsWelsh RugbyOspreysRugby UnionComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 110Top storiesLive. Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win - latest & reaction11110 viewing11k viewingLive. World Snooker Championship - live text6370 viewing6.4k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published15 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
