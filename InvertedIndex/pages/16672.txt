Everyone is really enjoying being in the environment. "No-one should expect results to happen straight away under a new coach. But we're confident that with a little more time with him, performances are going to come over the coming months and then the World Cup."Italy v Wales rearranged due to Pope's funeralPublished5 days agoScrum V: Wales target Tandy for head coach roleHurt Wales coach Lynn needs 'good pre-season'Published7 days agoDespite the losses, Wales have scored almost twice as many points in the Six Nations as they had at this stage in last year's tournament.Trailfinders player Cox is evidently enjoying life under Lynn, having gained more metres than every other player in the Six Nations except England stars Ellie Kildunne and Abby Dow. Only Italy's Sara Tounesi has made more offloads than Dow, who is also the only player with more linebreaks than Cox.The Wales speedster opened the scoring against Ireland last Sunday before Hannah Bluck followed. It was the first time the backs had scored all of Wales' points since they faced Italy last summer."Out attack is much more varied now and I'm really enjoying being involved far more," said Cox."In the past we've relied heavily on our forwards to score tries but that's not rugby. You need an all-round game and that's a big positive for us."We've been given freedom to give things a go, try new combinations and moves without fear of failing as we build to the World Cup."The Italy fixture is to be rearranged due to the funeral of Pope Francis.The two teams were due to meet in Parma at lunchtime on Saturday, 26 April in the final round of the tournament, but the Pope's funeral will take place at 10:00 local time (09:00 BST) that day.Tournament organisers have yet to confirm when - or where - the game will now go ahead.Related topicsWelsh RugbyWales SportRugby UnionComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 37Top storiesLive. Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win - latest & reaction11110 viewing11k viewingLive. World Snooker Championship - live text6370 viewing6.4k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published15 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
