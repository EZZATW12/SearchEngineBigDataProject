In recent years Wales and Ireland have taken it in turns to give each other a hammering.Wales ran out 31-5 winners in Cardiff in 2023 while Ireland repaid the favour in Cork last year with a 36-5 victory.While it would appear to be Wales' turn this weekend, form suggests otherwise.Ireland are now the fifth best side in the world after an impressive autumn saw them beat world champions New Zealand, while Wales have slumped to 10th.But the hosts are under new management in Sean Lynn, and hope to follow the same upward trajectory Ireland have taken since Scott Bemand took charge two years ago.Ireland payback on Wales star Georgia's mindPublished17 AprilThirteen hour travel out of Wales' hands - LynnPublished12 AprilTeam newsWales vice-captain Alex Callender will make her first appearance of the campaign after recovering from a foot injury.Usually a flanker, she has been named at number eight with Georgia Evans moving to her less favoured position of second row.Kelsey Jones gets the nods ahead of Carys Phillips at hooker in the only other starting change. Kayleigh Powell retains the fly-half jersey despite Lleucu George shaking off a calf injury which saw her miss the defeat to France. She is instead named among the replacements.Keeping her company on the bench is GB Sevens player Catherine Richards who is set for her first tournament outing.Edel McMahon returns to captain Ireland who are looking to cement their "best of the rest" status, with England and France once again set for a Grand Slam decider.The openside flanker missed last week's defeat by England through injury and is recalled to replace Erin King who has been ruled out of the rest of the tournament and the World Cup because of a serious knee injury.There are four other changes to the side, with Siobhan McCarthy making her first Test start at loose-head prop, with Ruth Campbell coming into the second row.Enya Breen returns in midfield while Molly Scuffil-McCabe makes her first appearance of the campaign at scrum-half.Sadhbh McGrath and Claire Boles are recalled to the bench.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Wales head coach Sean Lynn reflects on his first month in Test rugbyView from the campsWales head coach Sean Lynn said: "One thing which Ireland will bring is that energy and work rate, but we can bring that too. "That's something that I'm asking these players, 'let's match their energy, let's match their work rate and physicality' and then it could be a tight game."Aoife Wafer has been outstanding [for Ireland], she's a big ball carrier and Dannah O'Brien puts them in positions with her territorial game, they are the two big players and ones we will be looking at. "I definitely have [seen improvements]. The big thing for me is collision dominance, attack and defence, and getting better at it."Second half against France, we're making line-breaks, but to be in this championship and be a better team we have to be capitalising on these line-breaks."For me Carys Cox has been a standout ball carrier in our backline and we're really excited."Ireland head coach Scott Bemand said: "I live fairly close and grew up next to Wales and I understand what it's like to play in Wales. It's an unbelievable experience. They are passionate about their rugby."We've said we want to go after winning games away from home because that's going to be a massive part of a World Cup."Backing the Italy piece up this week and taking the green wave over there is going to be a massive for us."Playing away from home you've got the noise, the atmosphere, the occasion and we've got to learn to deal with it and get excited by it."We're still a young group, I've seen nothing in the eyes but good energy to get over there and get the job done, but we know it's not going to be easy, it's going to come with challenges and we're fully ready for that."Bemand says Ireland will regroup from King blowPublished18 AprilIreland's King to miss rest of Six Nations and World CupPublished17 AprilCommentator’s notes Gareth Rhys Owen said: "It seems strange to think that Wales travelled to Cork 12 months ago buoyed by a sense of optimism."The expectation was that they'd win, very few predicted a handsome Irish victory.  "That result was a reality check for the game in Wales. A new coach has brought fresh enthusiasm and until this game, little in terms of pressure.   "The red roses and France were a freebie – but having lost to Scotland – the next two matches come with a little bit of extra pressure.  "A win for Ireland will give them hope of finishing the best of the rest."Match statsIreland have won 10 of their last 13 Six Nations matches against Wales, however that includes a run of seven straight victories between 2012 and 2018.
