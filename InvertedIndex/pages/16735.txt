Her other responsibilities include improving the pathway into professional rugby, player contracts and preparing for the Rugby World Cup which kicks off in August."This is a hugely exciting time to be joining Welsh rugby and for the women and girls' game in particular," said Moore."The senior game in Wales has been professional for just three short years and is progressing and advancing at an exponential rate."These swift advancements of course come with their own teething problems and my eyes are wide open in terms of the challenge ahead, but I am hugely optimistic about what can be achieved."Moore says she hopes to make a significant impact during her nine months in charge."I'd love to leave the game in a much more settled place than it is now with a real clear direction and strategy for how we move forward," she said."And players that are happy and excited to be back playing for their national team, and those pathways where young girls and women in this country can see their opportunity to play for the national team as they progress through the rugby pathways."Walker steps down as WRU executive director of rugbyPublished20 December 2024Wales coach Cunningham quits after turbulent 2024Published8 November 2024Moore, the wife of former England hooker Brian Moore, is a significant appointment to the WRU high performance team.She oversaw the transition from the English women's domestic league being owned by the Rugby Football Union to becoming an independent company.She also secured the PWR's current broadcast deal with TNT Sports.Her resignation came as a surprise and she has her work cut out in her new role given the turbulent year Wales women had on and off the pitch in 2024. Wales finished bottom of the Women's Six Nations and only managed one win against Japan in WXV2.This was played out amid a bitter dispute between the WRU and players over professional contracts which led to an independent review and an apology to the players.Moore's appointment is one of the key recommendations in the review.The WRU chief executive Abi Tierney says appointing a head of women's rugby has been a "key priority"."We are delighted to have secured the services of someone of the calibre, gravitas and directly relevant senior experience of Belinda Moore," she said."This role will be the cornerstone of all the progress we make in the women and girls' game in Wales over the next five years as we implement our 'One Wales' strategy through to 2029."Moore begins her role immediately and will report to the WRU's new Director of Rugby, a role currently filled by Performance Director Huw Bevan.Bevan took over from Nigel Walker, who resigned before Christmas.Related topicsWelsh RugbyRugby UnionComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 117Top storiesLive. Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win - latest & reaction10647 viewing11k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published15 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished56 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
