France survive red card to beat Ireland in Six Nations openerPublished22 MarchSean Lynn was taking charge of his first Wales game having only linked up with the squad on Monday after winning a third league title with Gloucester-Hartpurty.Wales started their new era brightly, showing early glimpses of what had been promised with the backline seeing plenty of ball.Lynn had also promised a solid set-piece and Wales destroyed Scotland in the opening scrum to win a penalty five metres out.Wales launched their attack from line-out ball and Kate Williams made good ground before the ball was recycled out to Phillips who crashed over on her 80th cap.Scotland went on to dominate possession and territory for the remainder of the half, with Fran McGhie showing her threat with a meandering run after collecting a delicate dink from player of the match Helen Nelson, but the defence scrambled and managed to strip the ball.Scotland got on the board with a Nelson penalty and looked to have taken the lead shorty after from a five metre line-out.Rachel Malcolm took clean ball before being driven over the line, but there was a late intervention from the TMO as Wales were getting ready for the restart.The replays showed the maul had been illegally set up, and despite the Scotland skipper's protest, her effort was chalked off.The hosts continued to threaten, none more so than Lisa Thomson who looked devastating in attack, but Wales came up with crucial turnovers, with the likes of Fleming and Jasmine Joyce-Butchers heroic in defence.The red wall finally crumbled a few minutes before the break, Scotland stalwart Bonar driving low to the line, while Evans was sent to the sin-bin for collapsing the maul.Rowlands added the conversion which gave the hosts a three point lead heading down the tunnel.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Post-match reaction - Wales indiscipline let Scotland into the gameScotland resumed as they had finished the half, Gallagher with the initial line break before the ball was trucked up through the forwards and eventually out to Thomson for the try.But more drama ensued as Rachel McLachlan was shown to have obstructed the defence in the build-up much to the frustration of the 4,000 home crowd.But Wales remained their own worst enemy, Kayleigh Powell, playing in a new position at centre, was caught in possession which allowed Thomson to hoof the ball downfield. Wales looked to have scrambled but spilled possession under the pressure of the chase which allowed Orr to pick up the ball and sprint clear to the line.Wales then went on a rare attack with Chloe Rollie driven back over her own try line, but the tackle by Evans was high and she was shown a second yellow having only just returned to the field.Galvanised by the dismissal, Wales kept plugging away and this time it was Scotland who were under the TMO microscope with Gallagher shown a card for a dangerous cleanout.Wales attacked from the line-out and there was no stopping the maul with Fleming a deserved try-scorer having been at the heart of everything.Bevan reduced the deficit to just three points with a successful conversion to send the travelling fans wild as the rain poured down.But as conditions worsened, Scotland re-took control of the game and it was a brilliant passage of play which led to a try for Bartlett.Orr put Wales on the backfoot with another superb line-break, showing no signs of rust after a long injury lay-off, while Thomson was hauled down by Joyce-Butchers, but Scotland showed good patience which allowed the replacement prop to go over to give Scotland some breathing space once more.But Wales were not done, Powell had been just a roll away from crossing for a try, but Wales came again off the maul and it was the returning Pyrs who announced her arrival with a crucial try.Scotland managed the game well in the dying minutes as Wales tried desperately to win back possession, but as the clock turned red the ball was sent high into the crowd to start the celebrations.Wales do however travel home with deserved losing bonus-point. Scotland head coach Bryan Easson said: "It played out the way we thought it could. These games over the last five or six years have gone down to underneath seven points and it was exactly the same."I think Wales came out and showed that passion and fire, that new coach bounce that we kind of expected."We were disappointed however that we left points out there in the first half when we had 63% possession."I thought there were times when we played really well and times when we let Wales back into the game a little bit."Wales head coach Sean Lynn said: "What I asked the players to deliver this week, to bring energy and passion, I couldn't fault them out there today."We talked at half-time to try and play a more territorial game because our set piece and driving maul had gone really well, and they delivered that."I'm super proud of the group."There were some defensive system errors which we feel are easy fixes moving onto next week, and with England we'll definitely need to."Wales: Jasmine Joyce-Butchers; Lisa Neumann, Hannah Jones (capt), Kayleigh Powell, Carys Cox; Lleucu George, Keira Bevan; Maisie Davies, Carys Phillips, Jenni Scoble, Abbie Fleming, Alaw Pyrs, Kate Williams, Bethan Lewis, Georgia Evans.Replacements: Kelsey Jones, Gwenllian Pyrs, Donna Rose, Gwen Crabb, Bryonie King, Meg Davies, Courtney Keight, Nel Metcalfe.Scotland: Chloe Rollie; Rhona Lloyd, Emma Orr, Lisa Thomson, Francesca McGhie; Helen Nelson, Leia Brebner-Holden; Anne Young, Lana Skeldon, Elliann Clarke, Hollie Cunningham, Sarah Bonar, Rachel Malcolm (capt), Rachel McLachlan, Evie Gallagher.Replacements: Elis Martin, Leah Bartlett, Christine Belisle, Adelle Ferrie, Alex Stewart, Jade Konkel, Caity Mattinson, Evie Wills.Related topicsScottish RugbyWelsh RugbyRugby UnionComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 323Top storiesLive.Â Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win - latest & reaction10647 viewing11k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published15 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished56 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
