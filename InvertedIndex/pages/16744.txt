It was Italy's first win at home in two years as they finished fourth in the table, while Wales once again finished rock bottom, losing all five games for the first time in their history.Wales head coach Sean Lynn had spoken about the importance of an 80-minute performance in the build-up to the match, which had been delayed a day because of Pope Francis' funeral.But his side only managed a first 40 minutes as Wales were given a lesson in attacking rugby, with Italy running in five unanswered tries in a one-sided second half.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Vittoria Ostuni Minuzzi scores in Italy's record win over WalesLynn warns Wales to respond or face World Cup axePublished3 days agoWatch: Women's Six Nations - FT Wales wilt to record 44-12 loss in ItalyNo deadline but WRU want movement on new dealPublished2 days agoWales did enjoy all the early possession and territory, but struggled for collision dominance as they went through the phases.Italian indiscipline gifted them an attacking line-out and the Welsh maul, which had stuttered against Ireland, went back to being a weapon with the pack driving Williams over for her third try of the campaign.Italy responded in style with fly-half Veronica Madia showing her creativity with the boot, her cross-field kick just beating Alyssa D'Inca on her wing.But the hosts were not to be denied when some loose kicking from Lleucu George saw Sara Seye and Elisa Giordano burst through some weak tackling, with returning scrum-half Stefan finishing under the posts.Sillari added the conversion and, sensing it might be a close game, a later penalty to give Italy the lead.Momentum then shifted back to Wales and a fumble under the high ball from Minuzzi gave them a good attacking platform, but basic errors crept in and the visitors could not capitalise.But they were given another chance on the stroke of half-time. The attack once again came off line-out ball and the forwards showed good patience, keeping it tight until Pyrs pounced from close range.Bevan added the conversion to give Wales a 12-10 half-time lead, the first time this campaign they went down the tunnel ahead.But the optimism was short-lived as Italy came out with a change of tactic as they chose to engage in a kicking battle with George.It almost paid off with a chip setting up Giordana Duca, who would have been through if not for a last-gasp tap tackle from Jasmine Joyce-Butchers.Italy kept coming with wave after wave of attack as Wales struggled to live with their offloading game and when points were on offer Silari took the opportunity to kick Italy back in front.Lynn responded by making some early changes, with Alex Callender, Hannah Bluck and Carys Phillips all coming on to the field.But they were not able to make an impact as Italy kept piling on the pressure and managed to get the ball out wide to Granzotto, who did well to ride the defensive tackle and get the ball down in the corner.Wales desperately needed to get a foothold, but they could not live with the scintillating Azzurre attack.Italy went for the jugular and opted for a tap penalty in front of posts, and while the defence did well to repel the charging Sara Tounesi, they could not prevent Turani from stretching over the line.The fourth try came from the full-back Minuzzi, whose outstanding 50-22 launched Italy upfield. The forwards then carried hard before Minuzzi ran a fine line to cut through the defence.Wales were reduced to 14 players when Natalia John was sent to the sin bin for a high tackle, and took full advantage as Granzotto completed another fine finish in the corner while Muzzo crossed at the death to pile on the misery.Wales captain Hannah Jones said: "We're hurt."We know we can be better than that, we have to learn fast and be better."We cannot be in this position again."We need to get a good preseason under our belt and work on key areas, but right now I'm just gutted."Line-upsItaly: Vittoria Ostuni Minuzzi; Aura Muzzo, Michela Sillari, Sara Mannini, Alyssa D'Incá; Veronica Madia, Sofia Stefan; Silvia Turani, Vittoria Vecchini, Sara Tounesi, Giordana Duca, Beatrice Veronese, Francesca Sgorbini, Elisa Giordano (capt).Replacements: Desiree Spinelli, Emanuela Stecca, Gaia Maris, Isabella Locatelli, Alissa Ranuccini, Alia Bitonci, Beatrice Rigoni, Francesca Granzotto.Wales: Jasmine Joyce-Butchers; Lisa Neumann, Hannah Jones (capt), Courtney Keight, Carys Cox; Lleucu George, Keira Bevan; Gwenllian Pyrs, Kelsey Jones, Donna Rose, Abbie Fleming, Gwen Crabb, Kate Williams, Bethan Lewis, Georgia Evans.Replacements: Carys Phillips, Maisie Davies, Jenni Scoble, Natalia John, Alex Callender, Sian Jones, Hannah Bluck, Catherine Richards.Sin bin: Natalia John (76 mins)Related topicsWelsh RugbyRugby UnionComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 312Top storiesLive. Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win - latest & reaction10704 viewing11k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published15 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished57 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
