When it became apparent the rights could become available, we championed the potential for free-to-air coverage to reach as many Scotland supporters as possible and we are grateful that BBC and Uefa could reach agreement."The deal adds to the BBC's extensive football coverage of the Scottish Professional Football League, Scottish Cup and Scottish Championship across television, radio and online.Across the three nations, the deal includes 41 live matches over the next 15 months.Related topicsFootballFIFA World CupScotland Men's Football TeamTop storiesLive. Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win - latest & reaction10586 viewing11k viewingLive. World Snooker Championship - live text8748 viewing8.7k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published15 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Scottish sportWhat is still to be decided as season reaches climax?League reconstruction - why, when & what might it look like?Scotland men's internationals to be shown live on BBCCommonwealth Games: Why is it so special to be part of Team Scotland?From titles to tinpottery - rank Scotland's top 10 clubsElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
