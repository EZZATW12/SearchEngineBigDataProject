I'd be more frustrated if my players lay down and took punches," he told BBC Sport NI."I'm extremely proud of the players, I want fight and commitment, maybe not to the level after the game, but it takes two to tango."There are certain players in our changing room who are frustrated with certain members of the Larne team instigating fights."Devine says he intends to watch the post-match scenes back to get a "clearer picture" of what happened."There were a lot of handbags. Tensions were really high and there was a big prize at stake," he added. "Of course, you shouldn't lift your hands on a football pitch in the 90 minutes and there were a few digs thrown in the 18-yard box in the second half, but no room for violent actions at all during and after the game."The Glens boss will now have to pick his players up for the European play-offs."My only focus now is on the frustration that we didn't win this game. We didn't lose second place here today we lost it last week at Dungannon and before that at Crusaders when we dropped points."Related topicsIrish FootballTop storiesLive. Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win - latest & reaction10984 viewing11k viewingLive. World Snooker Championship - live text10145 viewing10k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published15 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Northern Ireland sportThe 'rugby student' stepping up to lead IrelandPre-contract agreements - why are they different in NI?Record-breaker Dunlop 'breaks mould' of modern sporting heroesMeet Jude McAtamney - the New York Giants kicker from Derry Elsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
