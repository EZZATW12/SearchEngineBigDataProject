They have capable players who have played in the Irish Premiership, it is going to be a very tough task for us, but we need to be up to that challenge."Baxter rested a number of key players as Carrick suffered a 4-0 defeat against Glenavon in their final league game on Saturday in order to have them in prime condition for the play-off."We need to have all the players fully fit and ready to play which I think they are, and we need to get our heads down over two legs and try win this game," he added."If your best is good enough you will win and get through."Hamilton appointed Ballymacash Rangers managerpublished at 15:12 27 April15:12 27 AprilImage source, Pacemaker PressImage caption, Hamilton has been out of management since he was sacked by Glenavon in September 2023Former Glenavon boss Gary Hamilton has been appointed as the new manager of Premier Intermediate side Ballymacash Rangers.Hamilton has been out of management since he was sacked by the Lurgan Blues in September 2023 after almost 12 years in charge of the Irish Premiership club.The former Northern Ireland international took over as player-manager in December 201, steering them off the bottom of the table and helping them avoid relegation during his first season in charge.He THEN led the Mid-Ulster club to two Irish Cup successes in 2014 and 2016, four third-place finishes, and the European football that came with that.Lisburn-based club Ballymacash finished fifth in the third tier this season.21:26 26 AprilWatch: Haveron reacts to post-match Inver Park brawl.

We pride ourselves on being a family club, there are a lot of kids in the stand and that is not how you end the game of football, but when someone comes on and attacks one of your teammates it is only natural you are going to react to it and that Glentoran would react to that.""It's not something we want to be associated with, and it is disappointing that that is what the talking points will be and not the grit and determination to get over the line against a good Glentoran side that threw the kitchen sink at us but couldn't break us."Haveron said that having watched the brawl back he hopes that the main perpetrators will be dealt with accordingly."You have to say to the boys to step back because it drags on and on but there was an antagonist," he added."People will get punished and rightfully so, I hope the antagonist is punished the most."20:56 26 AprilWatch: Devine on post-match Inver Park brawl.

I'd be more frustrated if my players lay down and took punches," he told BBC Sport NI."I'm extremely proud of the players, I want fight and commitment, maybe not to the level after the game, but it takes two to tango."There are certain players in our changing room who are frustrated with certain members of the Larne team instigating fights."Devine says he intends to watch the post-match scenes back to get a "clearer picture" of what happened."There were a lot of handbags. Tensions were really high and there was a big prize at stake," he added. "Of course, you shouldn't lift your hands on a football pitch in the 90 minutes and there were a few digs thrown in the 18-yard box in the second half, but no room for violent actions at all during and after the game."The Glens boss will now have to pick his players up for the European play-offs."My only focus now is on the frustration that we didn't win this game. We didn't lose second place here today we lost it last week at Dungannon and before that at Crusaders when we dropped points."20:30 26 AprilHighlights: Dungannon Swifts 1-0 Crusaders, published at 20:30 26 AprilHighlights: Dungannon Swifts 1-0 CrusadersAttributionIrish Football20:30 26 AprilHighlights: Larne draw with Glentoran to secure second spot, published at 20:30 26 AprilHighlights: Larne draw with Glentoran to secure second spotAttributionIrish Football20:30 26 AprilHighlights: Portadown 2-1 Ballymena United, published at 20:30 26 AprilHighlights: Portadown 2-1 Ballymena UnitedAttributionIrish Football20:30 26 AprilHighlights: Cliftonville cruise to win over Loughgall to seal seventh, published at 20:30 26 AprilHighlights: Cliftonville cruise to win over Loughgall to seal seventhAttributionIrish Football20:27 26 AprilWatch: Four sent off after post-match brawl.

They were, however, able to play qualifying rounds at Inver Park, including a famous victory over Lincoln Red Imps. Two seasons ago, issues with the playing surface at their home ground in east Antrim saw the Inver Reds play their European games at Cliftonville's Solitude ground. Larne said there was a "single issue" that prevented them staging games in 2023-24 that was rectified for this season. With the pitch now in its eighth year, a similar fix "was not a possibility" this time around.Gary Haveron's side are second in the Irish Premiership going into the final day of the season on Saturday and will qualify for Europe should they avoid defeat at home to Glentoran in a game to be streamed live on the BBC iPlayer and website. Even if they lose out on second place to the Glens, Larne could still make it into the Conference League qualifying rounds through the Irish Premiership European play-off.Dungannon Swifts have also had to put forward an alternative venue, listing Solitude rather than Stangmore Park.Rodney McAree's side would qualify for Europe if they win the Irish Cup final against Cliftonville on 3 May or come through the play-off.Larne expect 'best version of Glentoran' - Haveronpublished at 08:48 25 April08:48 25 AprilImage source, InphoImage caption, Larne are second in the table, a point ahead of Glentoran going into their contest at Inver ParkLarne boss Gary Haveron said his side are "preparing to face the best version of Glentoran" during Saturday's final round of Irish Premiership fixtures.Haveron's side occupy second place in the table and know a draw against third-place Glentoran at Inver Park will be enough to seal the runners-up spot and automatic European qualification.Glentoran can still snatch second and avoid the play-offs with a win and Haveron believes his side must treat the game like a cup final."That has to be the mentality going into it, it's a winner takes all game, yes we can get a draw, but we never set the team up to draw, and Saturday will not be any different," he told BBC Sport NI."We know what we're going to face with the Glens, they're a quality side and we're preparing for the best version of Glentoran to come to Inver Park."The Larne boss admitted it has been a "long, long season" due to the club's participation in the league phase of the Uefa Conference League that left them playing catch-up in the Irish Premiership.However, he believes clinching the runners-up spot and getting back into Europe without having to go through the play-offs would be the perfect way to round off a historic season."Given the season we have had, it would be nice to get it [European qualification] wrapped up on Saturday. It has been incredibly tough at times and there has been a lot of learning," he added."The European campaign, I wouldn't have changed for the world, it was unbelievable to be a part of. We want to create more memories and get back into Europe."It's very much still in our hands; we have clawed ourselves back to second and that is where we aim to stay."Healy, Magilton and McAree lead NIFWA nominationspublished at 08:17 25 April08:17 25 AprilImage source, InphoImage caption, David Healy, Jim Magilton and Rodney McAree are nominated for Manager of the YearDavid Healy, Jim Magilton and Rodney McAree lead the nominations for Manager of the Year at the annual Northern Ireland Football Writers' Association awards.
