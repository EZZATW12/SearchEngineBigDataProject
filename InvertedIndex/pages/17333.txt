"It's a long-term commitment they have made to the club; they want to transform the club as much as they can and that will start by transitioning into full-time football and how we can redevelop the ground and improve facilities."Harding hopes that the Reds' move to full-time football will take place over a number of years, but that plans for moving forward are still to be ratified."Over the next two to three years we will transition, but we haven't sat down yet with them to go through the detail of the timing of everything but that will take place next week."Related topicsIrish FootballTop storiesLive. Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win - latest & reaction9415 viewing9.4k viewingLive. World Snooker Championship - live text9813 viewing9.8k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published15 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Northern Ireland sportThe 'rugby student' stepping up to lead IrelandPre-contract agreements - why are they different in NI?Record-breaker Dunlop 'breaks mould' of modern sporting heroesMeet Jude McAtamney - the New York Giants kicker from Derry Elsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
