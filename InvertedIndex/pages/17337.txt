I always give respect to anybody who achieves," said the Glentoran manager."I also texted David – people don't understand. I won't make any comment on a guard of honour, but Declan Devine as a human being is the first to congratulate any fellow manager because I know how difficult it is."That's my outlook. I congratulated David in front of his own staff and also did it privately. My sole focus going into football matches is to win."With two series of games to go, Glentoran are currently in the second spot in the Irish Premiership table which secures European football - albeit they are 25 points adrift of the new champions.The Glens will be keeping a close eye on Friday's contest at Inver Park as third-placed Larne welcome the Blues.Larne will have the opportunity to move above the Glens into second place in the table but defeat for Gary Haveron's side would mean Devine's players would have the opportunity to guarantee the runners-up spot by winning at Dungannon Swifts on Saturday.Related topicsNorthern Ireland SportFootballIrish FootballTop storiesLive. Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win - latest & reaction9415 viewing9.4k viewingLive. World Snooker Championship - live text9813 viewing9.8k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published15 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Northern Ireland sportThe 'rugby student' stepping up to lead IrelandPre-contract agreements - why are they different in NI?Record-breaker Dunlop 'breaks mould' of modern sporting heroesMeet Jude McAtamney - the New York Giants kicker from Derry Elsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
