"The competition in the league is so fierce now. Obviously finances does and will help you try and bring maybe a different level of player. "We'll still go about our business the way we do in terms of recruitment and try and look at the characteristics of the player and that won't change. "I haven't spoken to anybody from the group, so I won't know that until I'm invited into that conversation."Magilton added that "somewhere down the line, I [will] get an opportunity to speak to them and see what their vision is"."Even when I was an outsider looking in, it's a club with massive potential," continued the Reds boss."That's brought to the fore with an Irish Cup final, when you see the numbers coming in, the tickets selling so quickly and the redevelopment of the ground etc. It puts Cliftonville on the map."Related topicsNorthern Ireland SportFootballIrish FootballTop storiesLive. Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win - latest & reaction9415 viewing9.4k viewingLive. World Snooker Championship - live text9813 viewing9.8k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published15 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Northern Ireland sportThe 'rugby student' stepping up to lead IrelandPre-contract agreements - why are they different in NI?Record-breaker Dunlop 'breaks mould' of modern sporting heroesMeet Jude McAtamney - the New York Giants kicker from Derry Elsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
