"Ultimately if we can then finance to bring in good players, I think we've done a really good job with that, but some of the players that we've spoken to we just haven't had the financial capabilities to bring them in. "If that changes then we'll put ourselves in a better position and maybe be more competitive in the league."Cliftonville will be bidding to retain the Irish Cup when they meet Dungannon Swifts in the showpiece final at Windsor Park next month, a ground where they have already lifted the BetMcLean Cup this season.Their league form has, however, been inconsistent and they failed to make the top six before the end-of-season split. Magilton added that at this stage he did not know how the club would look under new owners. "The legalities of a takeover are as such that I've stayed out of that and that will be down to the members and the board," he added. "If they get that over the line, then it'll be conversations ongoing after that. "It has to be signed, sealed and delivered or you won't really know. We have to make plans for both scenarios. "Whatever one works out, we just have to get on with it."Related topicsFootballIrish FootballTop storiesLive. Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win - latest & reaction9415 viewing9.4k viewingLive. World Snooker Championship - live text9813 viewing9.8k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published15 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Northern Ireland sportThe 'rugby student' stepping up to lead IrelandPre-contract agreements - why are they different in NI?Record-breaker Dunlop 'breaks mould' of modern sporting heroesMeet Jude McAtamney - the New York Giants kicker from Derry Elsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
