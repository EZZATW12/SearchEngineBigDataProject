However, after 18 league goals this campaign, as well as netting the winner in the BetMcLean Cup final against Glentoran in March, the 36-year-old feels he "might have guaranteed" another year in Jim Magilton's squad."This was going to be potentially my last year," he said."I didn't think I'd have played as much this year. I didn't think I would have scored as much."I think I might have guaranteed myself another year. Potentially next year could be my last year."The former Peterborough United player, who has scored 292 goals for the Reds and stated his ambition to reach 300, added that family will guide any decision on his future."My oldest [son] has started to play a bit of football and I love going to watch him," he added."It might be time for me to be going to watch him rather than them coming to watch me."I don't want to kid myself, I don't want to be picking up a wage if I'm not fit enough. "Who knows? Last year I thought this year was potentially my last year and here we have it, I'm hoping to get another year. "Fingers crossed, I'll be injury free and we'll see what happens."Related topicsNorthern Ireland SportIrish FootballTop storiesLive. Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win - latest & reaction11310 viewing11k viewingLive. World Snooker Championship - live text11358 viewing11k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published15 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Northern Ireland sportThe 'rugby student' stepping up to lead IrelandPre-contract agreements - why are they different in NI?Record-breaker Dunlop 'breaks mould' of modern sporting heroesMeet Jude McAtamney - the New York Giants kicker from Derry Elsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
