Loughgall's January windowImage source, PacemakerImage caption, Benji Magee is back at Loughgall on loan from LarnePublished4 February 2025Loughgall's second season back in the Irish Premiership has been difficult and Dean Smith's side are bottom of the table.In a blow to their survival hopes, key striker Nathaniel Ferris departed the club for Glentoran late in the window.However, Smith's side have been boosted by the return of Benji Magee on loan from Larne, and if the Villagers are to stay up then the 22-year-old will need to rediscover the magic that led him to Inver Park in the summer.Fra McCaffrey is an experienced addition and young striker Kirk McLaughlin was highly-rated at Coleraine.Loughgall have also brought in Robbie Mahon from Dundalk, Matthew O'Brien from Drodgheda United and Glenavon defender James Carroll.They may be nine points adrift at the bottom of the league, but progress from the quarter-finals of the Irish Cup could still give the club something to celebrate.In: Benji Magee (Larne - loan), James Carroll (Glenavon), Robbie Mahon (Dundalk), Fra McCaffrey (Newry City), Kirk McLaughlin (Coleraine), Matthew O'Brien (Drogheda United).Out: Nathaniel Ferris (Glentoran), Conor McDermott (St James Swifts), Ben Harvey (Newry City - loan), Andrew Hoey (Annagh United - loan), Jay Boyd (Crusaders - end of loan).Related topicsFootballIrish FootballTop storiesLive. Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win - latest & reaction11317 viewing11k viewingLive. World Snooker Championship - live text11520 viewing12k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published15 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Northern Ireland sportThe 'rugby student' stepping up to lead IrelandPre-contract agreements - why are they different in NI?Record-breaker Dunlop 'breaks mould' of modern sporting heroesMeet Jude McAtamney - the New York Giants kicker from Derry Elsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
