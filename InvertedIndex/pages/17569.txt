"That was a risk."But there are things here that are more important than scoring 10 more goals this season."We are trying to do something that is more important. We can hurt the squad now but in the future it will help the club."Everyone wants to play for Man Utd - AmorimPublished2 days agoRashford doubts he will play for Man Utd again under AmorimPublished5 days agoFollowing his appointment in November, Amorim said he had wanted to take the job at the end of the season but accepted an immediate appointment after being told it was "now or never".The Portuguese acknowledges there have been moments when he has wondered whether he should have been braver in discussions with United chief executive Omar Berrada over that initial request to move from Sporting at the end of this campaign."If you ask me four months ago, with all the problems, maybe I have the feeling I should be stronger in saying I will start at the beginning of the season," said Amorim, whose team play Bournemouth on Sunday."But today, I am feeling it is something that is going to help us in the future."We are suffering a lot here. There is a lot of frustration but I feel, in this moment, maybe because we are near the end, this is the most important time, maybe, in the next few years."We are going to use all the information to prepare better the next few years, so [I have] no regrets."Related topicsManchester UnitedFootballMore on this storyLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan viewsGet Man Utd news notificationsPublished26 July 2022Comments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 543Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9432 viewing9.4k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished25 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
