Have your sayMan Utd interested in Wolves striker CunhaPublished6 days agoMarcus Rashford: What does his future hold?Rashford is a more attractive proposition for potential suitors than he was when he joined Villa on 2 February.While four goals in 17 games could not be regarded as prolific, his overall contribution - including six assists - to the Villa cause has been significant.It earned Rashford a recall to the England fold and has kept fellow international Ollie Watkins frustrated on the Villa substitutes bench.Saturday's FA Cup semi-final meeting with Crystal Palace and a continuing battle for a Champions League place, after his excellent performance against Paris St-Germain last week, is a far more positive position than United's ongoing struggles.As one of United's highest earners, the number of clubs who could meet Rashford's salary is not extensive.However, United did fund part of his wages to push the Villa move through and the feeling around the Rashford camp is there is likely to be significant interest in him in the summer, which is when he wants to assess his options.Villa boss Unai Emery has been cautious about discussing Rashford's future at the club."I am so happy with him," said Emery after Villa's defeat by City. "He is performing very well. His adaptation has been quick and his commitment to the process is really important for us and for him."He needs to keep going and on Saturday, hopefully he can help again."Related topicsManchester UnitedAston VillaFootballMore on this storyLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan viewsGet Man Utd news notificationsPublished26 July 2022Top storiesLive. Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win - latest & reaction10383 viewing10k viewingLive. World Snooker Championship - live text12030 viewing12k viewingNational power outage stops play at Madrid OpenPublished8 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
