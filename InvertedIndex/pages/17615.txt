"The one thing we will never know is what Emery's man-management skills are like with these players."It is healthy for a club like Villa to have competition for places, especially when Watkins has been there for so long."I love that he is angry and he is fuming because that is what you want from your players. You don't want them to settle for the bench - you want them to be competitive - but it seems the dynamic has now been upset in the process."I think the way Emery has gone about it all could have been better publicly to keep it more healthy between them. He could have come out and said that Watkins is still their main striker but he is rotating to calm the media."It's about not letting the stories gain momentum on the press side and that is what Emery has allowed to happen."Listen to the Football Daily podcast on BBC Sounds22:42 27 AprilFive points separate five teams - who will prosper in race for Europe?, published at 22:42 27 AprilFive points separate five teams - who will prosper in race for Europe?AttributionPremier League22:15 27 AprilVilla object to Spurs request for fixture change, published at 22:15 27 AprilVilla object to Spurs request for fixture changeAttributionFootball'One to forget' and 'simply embarrassing' - the fans' verdictpublished at 15:38 27 April15:38 27 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesWe asked for your thoughts after Saturday's FA Cup semi-final between Crystal Palace and Aston Villa, which saw Unai Emery's side crash out of the competition.Here are some of your replies:Rob: Terrible performance. Unai got it wrong. What is it with our performances against Palace? It was as if we knew we would lose so we didn't make the effort. Passes were going astray, we were not closing them down and virtually everyone was having an off day. One to forget.Rich: Awful, devoid of ideas and tired. Crystal Palace were much the better team. Every turn, flick and dummy was easy to snuff out. Suddenly our season looks as barren as all of the others.Mike: That was simply embarrassing. Villa were second best in every position throughout the 101 minutes of play. Whatever Emery's Plan A was, it clearly wasn't working from about five minutes in and then there was no Plan B. Full credit to Glasner and his players as they turned up. Villa simply gave them absolutely nothing to beat. From here the season fizzles out into Conference League qualification. At best.Cassie: Fair play to Palace - they read Villa very well and at the start soaked up what Villa tried to attack with. Then they taught Villa a lesson. Our dreams of maybe winning the Champions League are gone, the FA Cup is gone and finishing in the top four is gone. Three words I don't want to use: Thursday Night Football.Gordon: Our manager does not appreciate the importance of the FA Cup to English and Welsh fans. He has treated it as a minor competition. Last time Villa won the FA Cup, I was two years old and I hoped this could be our year.20:41 26 April'Unbelievable performance' - Glasner on Palace win.

Then we created more chances to score and we didn't score. In transition, they are very good and they deserved to win."After the first goal, we pushed some corners. We had our moments but we have to accept defeat. We were motivated for the semi-final and we lost, but we keep going."Two years ago, when I arrived here, we were in a really bad moment. We are improving and our level is going up so quickly. Yes, of course, we lost in the Europa Conference League semi-final against Olympiacos as well."Everything we are doing is increasing our demands and today the loss is something we have to accept. Sorry to our supporters because they were motivated."We have to be quick to react because in the league we have the most important objective. Today we lost, thank you to our supporters, congratulations to Crystal Palace, and we keep going. Now it is finished and we focus on the next match."On Marcus Rashford: "I told you, he is injured."20:14 26 AprilHow Crystal Palace made the most of their 'moments' against Aston Villa.

The manager spoke at length in there to remind us of how far we have come. It's not to get away from the disappointment."What was at stake today was huge for both clubs but, for us, we are craving success and a trophy. The club has not experienced that for a long time."But the manager doesn't have to rant and rave, it was a huge disappointment. We are going to use the hurt from today to come back stronger next season and hopefully get the supporters another trip to Wembley."The overriding feeling is hurt and disappointment. We've got an important last four games to achieve European football again and get back into the Champions League, so we can't sulk for too long."On why they couldn't challenge Palace today: "We weren't at our best, it was clear. But there are big moments in the game where Crystal Palace did better than us. I don't think anyone could watch the game and think Palace didn't deserve to win."On bouncing back from the disappointment: "We have had a lot of praise for last couple of seasons, now we will get criticism. We have got to take it on the chin, puff our chests out, and try to stay together."It is easy for a day like this to disrupt and dismantle what we are building, but we are building something special. Everyone within the club and outside the club can see that. The manager, the staff and the owners we have got - this club is set up and we'll be back here."At the moment, it stings. But some days football comes and punches you in the face and today is one of those days."19:38 26 AprilSarr seals win with goal in stoppage time.

They rested Jean-Philippe Mateta at the Emirates Stadium but created loads of chances and should have won.It was a very different Palace performance to the one I watched when I was at St James' Park last week, when they were torn apart by Newcastle, so it's hard to know what to expect here.The fact Villa have struggled against them this season shows what Palace are capable of, given how good Unai Emery's side have been.As well as the FA Cup, Villa are still in the race for the top five and did so well to reach the Champions League quarter-finals too.Emery deserves a bit of silverware to reflect the excellent job he has done but we know football doesn't work like that.Villa were unlucky to lose to Manchester City on Tuesday but the question is whether they have got another big performance in them, like the ones they have produced in Europe.My head tells me that if Villa turn up then Palace won't beat them again, but I still think this will be extremely close and it will go to extra-time before Villa's bench wins it for them.Sutton's prediction: 2-3 after extra-timeRead the full predictions and have your say hereDoes having an extra day to prepare for a game really make a difference?published at 18:56 25 April18:56 25 AprilCrystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner suggested it was unfair that Aston Villa had an extra day to prepare for their FA Cup semi-final but does that actually have an impact?Former Premier League midfielder Michael Brown addresses the issue on The Football News Show...This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch The Football News Show on BBC iPlayerRashford or Watkins?published at 16:00 25 April16:00 25 AprilThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Marcus Rashford was prefered to Ollie Watkins in Aston Villa's Champions League quarter-final second leg win over PSG and their most recent Premier League game against Manchester City but who should start in the FA Cup semi-final against Crystal Palace?Hannah Gowen from fan channel Up The Villa outlines the case for Watkins on The Football News Show while former Premier League midfielder Michael Brown believes Unai Emery should not take sentiment into account when choosing his starting 11.Watch The Football News Show on iPlayerEmery on a fit squad, Olsen and a 'special' semi-final against Palacepublished at 15:09 25 April15:09 25 AprilAston Villa boss Unai Emery has been speaking to the media before Saturday's FA Cup semi-final against Crystal Palace at Wembley (17:15 BST).Here are the key lines from his news conference:Emery confirmed he has a full squad to select from: "We will need our starting XI and all the players on the bench to be ready to play. We are ready for 90 minutes, extra-time, penalty shoot-out."On what he expects from the semi-final against Palace: "It will be very difficult. It's a good opportunity for us to be in this semi-final and share this moment with our supporters. My expectation is a very difficult match because of their motivation, they are in a very good moment. We are motivated like them, in a good moment like them, and we want to try and play with our best performance collectively and individually."More on the Eagles: "They played very well the last match against Arsenal. It's really giving us this information on how they act. I have massive respect for the coach, massive respect for Crystal Palace and the players and massive respect for the semi-final."He was asked about what walking out at Wembley will mean to him: "I will enjoy. I am a coach and I love my profession and work. Tomorrow I will enjoy it. Of course, I have a huge responsibility to respond in a good way with the players but I really am so so excited to play matches like we will tomorrow with the possibility we will have in the FA Cup."On what it will mean to Villa fans: "It is something special when you are sharing it with our supporters because I know it is special for them. They will travel with us to be in Wembley and it really means we improve in everything."On reports goalkeeper Robin Olsen will leave the club at the end of the season: "The respect for him in the dressing room, from the players and myself as a coach, is massive. He is a fantastic guy. He always helps us when we need him. He's an example in every way, and the message he constantly sends in the dressing room is to think of others, not be selfish. He is a really great man and a great goalkeeper. We'll focus on tomorrow, and whatever happens after the season, I'll have respect especially for him."Follow all of Friday's Premier League news conferences and the rest of the day's football news'I hope he stays' - what does the future hold for Watkins?published at 12:14 25 April12:14 25 AprilRichard SutherlandFan writerThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, As Ollie Watkins finds himself on the Aston Villa bench at key moments, we asked one of BBC Sport's go-to club contributors what the future holds for the England striker.
