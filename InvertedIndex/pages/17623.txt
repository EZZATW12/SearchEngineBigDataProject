These are supposedly 'professional' footballers - I think they need to take a long hard look at themselves in the mirror. I've seen more skill and passion from non-league sides.Oliver: A game of two halves - the nostalgic Southampton of then and the daunting Southampton of now. Simon Rusk has elevated us from 'that bad' to 'not that bad', and we looked like dominant for the first 45 minutes. Unfortunately, the second half underscored our disappointing season and the sad reality that lesser sides like Fulham, among others, have overtaken us. It left me with doubt that we could ever return to our glory days.Bill: I'm not sure how many time Jan Bednarek has cost us points this season. I realise that at times he has saved us, but sadly neither he nor Jack Stephens are Premier League standard and they never have been. Our defence was tired and disorganised but I wasn't aware of any forwards having a pop at goal. If you don't shoot you won't score! I'm not sure why folk thought Ross Stewart was the prodigal son returning. I've not seen anything to persuade me of his value to the club. Sell him!Marc: Stephens was a gladiator - he gave it his all. It's a shame the rest of his team couldn't be bothered. Super Jack Stephens.Fulham fansMatthew: A pretty poor performance, particularly in the first half. Many individual errors throughout the whole game and we were very lucky that Southampton had no threat. Credit where it's due for Southampton's gameplan, but also the Fulham substitutes were impactful. I also felt Southampton's substitute of Stewart for Cameron Archer really helped Fulham. A win is a win!Richard: Three points, but what a struggle to get there. They are not likely to make Europe - they are just too inconsistent and conceding late goals has been their undoing.Will: We never make it easy for ourselves. We need Crystal Palace to lose the FA Cup final for eighth place to be good enough. We need to do all that we can to keep our position.Michael: I really can't understand why Marco Silva keeps playing Andreas Pereira because he makes very little contribution to the overall game. Time and time again he fails to make a decent cross from a corner and worse still his free kicks are consistently poor. His unnecessary tackle in the 17th minute gifted Southampton their first attempt. Time to go, I think.Sessegnon 'could be the shining light'published at 08:1308:13Laura KenyonFinal Score reporterImage source, Getty Images"We needed that" posted Ryan Sessegnon on X after bagging the late winner at Southampton.In fact, it is Fulham who seem to need Sessegnon as they fight for European football.In the goals department, Fulham are at risk of faltering. Raul Jimenez, their top scorer, has not found the back of the net since early March with their in-form frontman Rodrigo Muniz now sidelined through injury.At times against Southampton, it seemed like they would never score. Despite relentless pressure, they lacked quality in the final third.So the Fulham fans look to 24-year-old academy product Sessegnon, who is enjoying a second spell at his first professional club and given his form, he could be the shining light illuminating the route to Europe next season.22:42 27 AprilFive points separate five teams - who will prosper in race for Europe?, published at 22:42 27 AprilFive points separate five teams - who will prosper in race for Europe?AttributionPremier LeagueCatch up on the Premier League actionpublished at 12:29 27 April12:29 27 AprilMark Chapman presents highlights and analysis from Saturday's five Premier League fixtures, which saw Ipswich Town's relegation from the top-flight confirmed.If you missed Match of the Day, you can catch up now on BBC iPlayer.Listen back to full match commentary from Newcastle United 3-0 Ipswich Town on BBC Sounds.Fulham reignite European hopes with dramatic winpublished at 18:28 26 April18:28 26 AprilAdwaidh RajanBBC Sport journalistImage source, ReutersFulham shrugged off an underwhelming first-half display to post a dramatic 2-1 comeback win against relegated Southampton in the Premier League on Saturday. And in doing so, Marco Silva's side bolstered their hopes of playing in Europe for the first time since a Europa League campaign in 2011-12. On the back of defeats against Bournemouth and Chelsea, Fulham endured a first half to forget at St Mary's Stadium as they fell behind to a Jack Stephens goal and failed to register a single shot on target.  But it was the substitutes who helped turn their fortunes around as Emile Smith Rowe grabbed the equaliser only six minutes after coming on in the 66th minute - with his side's first shot on target. Silva's changes were also crucial behind Ryan Sessegnon's winning goal in the second minute of second-half added time. Tom Cairney and Adama Traore, both having come off the bench, exchanged passes before the Spanish winger crossed in from the right for Sessegnon to head past Aaron Ramsdale and inflict another painful defeat on the Saints. The win helped the Cottagers climb to eighth and if they could hold on to the position, it could give them a berth in next season's Europa League or Conference League. But competition will be stiff as they remain tied on 51 points with Brighton and are only two points clear of 10th-placed Bournemouth, who will welcome Manchester United on Sunday. 18:18 26 AprilFulham's European 'flame' still alive - Silva.

From the first minute, we were the team that took the control. Our first half was not at the level we normally play at, and it makes it harder when you concede a goal from a wide free-kick where we clearly should have done much better."There were not many first half chances, but enough for a different half-time result. We lacked confidence and composure in the 18-yard box and missed some moments that we had to equalise the game."The changes at half-time were to give different things to the team. We had more 1v1s with Adama and Lukic - and we were more dynamic with Wilson in the middle."We know Emile is good in those spaces on the half-turn, receiving the ball, and he is a crucial player when he's at his best. Let's hope this goal gives him the confidence that is needed. And Sessegnon, we know he smells the balls inside the box and the moments to finish."The win is what we needed. We wanted to bounce back and reignite the flame to fight for what we want. We are playing final, after final, after final and it will be like that every week for the rest of the season."This three points is massive for us - and now we have to prepare well for the next final against Aston Villa."Southampton 1-2 Fulham: Key statspublished at 17:56 26 April17:56 26 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesFulham have scored three 90th-minute winners in the Premier League this season, the joint-most of any side (level with Brighton).Fulham have also had 15 goals scored by substitutes in the Premier League this season, the joint most of any side in a single season in the competition's history (also 15 for Arsenal in 2009-10, Manchester City in 2011-12 and Liverpool in 2015-16).Ryan Sessegnon has had a hand in six goals across his past eight Premier League appearances for Fulham - 4 goals, 2 assists - which is as many as in his previous 59 games in the competition combined.'The manager was very disappointed with us in the first half'published at 17:21 26 April17:21 26 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesFulham defender Ryan Sessegnon has been speaking to Premier League Productions about the performance: "I feel amazing - very, very happy. It was a difficult game. They made it hard for us, particularly in the first half, but credit to the boys because we kept digging. We had most of the ball in the second half and thankfully got the winner."We knew it was going to be difficult to come here. They have got the chance to play with freedom because, unfortunately for them, they are already down and so the pressure is off."They showed their quality with the free-kick and we just had to respond in the second half - thankfully we did."The manager was very disappointed with us in the first half. We weren't dynamic enough on the ball and we didn't penetrate enough. In the second half, we played with more urgency and moved the ball much quicker because we had to - and that won us the game."The win was very important today. We had the chance to play before Bournemouth and we got the three points, so now the pressure is back on them."On scoring the 1000th goal of the Premier League season: "That is crazy. A very good landmark, so I'm happy with that."17:06 26 AprilSessegnon snatches Fulham win at Southampton, published at 17:06 26 AprilSessegnon snatches Fulham win at SouthamptonAttributionPremier LeagueComments289Southampton 1-2 Fulham - send us your thoughtspublished at 16:57 26 April16:57 26 AprilWere you at the game or following from elsewhere?Have your say on Southampton's performanceWhat did you make of Fulham's display?Come back to this page on Monday to find a selection of your repliesFollow Saturday's Premier League games livepublished at 11:39 26 April11:39 26 AprilFive matches make up Saturday's Premier League action and BBC Sport will bring you every kick.Chelsea v Everton (12:30)Brighton v West HamNewcastle v Ipswich - BBC Radio 5 Live commentarySouthampton v Fulham Wolves v Leicester All kick-off times 15:00 BST unless statedFollow all of the action and reaction hereSutton's predictions: Southampton v Fulhampublished at 11:16 26 April11:16 26 AprilSouthampton's draw with West Ham means they have equalled the points tally of Robbie Savage's useless Derby County side in 2007-08, but I still feel my 606 co-host has to go down as the Premier League's worst-ever captain.I take my hat off to Saints fans, because they have stuck with their team through such a dismal season - and maybe they will have something to celebrate when they play Leicester next week.I don't see them getting anything here, though. Fulham will be annoyed at letting their lead slip against Chelsea last time out, but they have got more quality than Southampton, and they will make it count.Sutton's prediction: 0-2Read the full predictions and have your say hereSilva on Muniz, end-of-season targets and Southamptonpublished at 16:49 24 April16:49 24 AprilFulham boss Marco Silva has been speaking to the media before Saturday's Premier League game at Southampton (kick-off 15:00 BST).Here are the key lines from his news conference:Rodrigo Muniz will be unavailable through injury and it will be "very difficult" for him to be ready for the following game. Silva added that he will "be a big miss" for the team given his recent form.The Fulham boss also confirmed Emile Smith Rowe has returned to training and a decision will be made on Friday whether he is fit enough to return.Silva praised Ryan Sessegnon for his performances on both wings and feels he has "taken his chance with goals and assists" in recent games.On whether Harry Wilson will be ready to start as he continues his recovery from injury: "Harry is always a threat. We can use him from the start or the bench. I understand the question, but it has been a long period out of the game and training. He is in good shape and from the start or the bench he will definitely be involved. We need his goals and assists as well."Silva is "definitely" excited by the business end of the season: "If you want to be successful, you work for these sorts of times. Different clubs will be fighting to be champions or for semi-finals, like clubs will be doing in a few days in the FA Cup, but the reality is that you want to arrive at the last stages of the season with the chance to fight [for your goals]."He added: "I told you before the first Premier League match that our goal was to be in the top half of the table - I haven't changed from that moment. I told you that will be our target and we are now in a position where we can fight for something and we are going to fight. We have worked so hard throughout the season to be here now, in a decisive moment for us, and we have to embrace the challenge ahead of us."The Portuguese said their goalless draw against the Saints in December is not easy to compare to this fixture as it was "in different circumstances" to now.On what he expects from their already-relegated opponents: "Their future, about playing in the Championship, is already clear for them. The game can be different, but analysing their past two games, the approach is more or less the same. Compact block and five-at-the-back. Let's see how the game starts and what their approach is going to be but I'm 100 per cent sure our approach will not change."Fulham in talks with Tete over new dealpublished at 10:31 24 April10:31 24 AprilNizaar KinsellaBBC Sport football news reporterImage source, Getty ImagesFulham are in talks to renew defender Kenny Tete's contract as it expires at the end of the season. The 29-year-old defender has yet to agree terms as he seeks improved pay on a two or three-year deal.Sources from both sides are hopeful of reaching a positive outcome in negotiations.However, there remains a possibility a major club could hijack talks with the Netherlands international, who is free to negotiate with other clubs with just two months left on his current deal.Tete is known to be happy in London, enjoys playing in the Premier League and believes he can still play at the top level.He also has a positive relationship with manager Marco Silva who has been linked with a move to replace Ange Postecoglou at Tottenham.Tete started his first Premier League match in four months in the 2-1 defeat by Chelsea on Sunday after recovering from a knee injury.09:00 24 AprilCunha, Barnes and Sessegnon to shine - FPL tips and team of week, published at 09:00 24 AprilCunha, Barnes and Sessegnon to shine - FPL tips and team of weekAttributionPremier LeagueComments53Why Silva's Fulham will go down as 'the nearly men'published at 12:37 22 April12:37 22 AprilDrew HeatleyFan writerImage source, Getty ImagesThat feels like the inevitable tag that will be placed on this side: one that offered so much, but ultimately delivered so little.We have lost 25 points from winning positions this season. No team is infallible - and we would never expect to win every game we score first in. But the proportion of those points lost in the 85th minute or later tells the real story.Sunday's loss against Chelsea was the latest example of how close we have been to glory this season, but also how far we are from reaching that next level.This campaign will likely end up being our most successful in terms of games won and points acquired, and yet we will probably finish outside the European places in a season when as low as eighth could qualify.That makes it hard to assess whether this campaign has been a success or a failure - and whether Marco Silva has done as much as he can with this Fulham side.Our squad is too small - a 23-man first-team squad attests to that. So, has Marco been backed enough? I do not mean just financially, but through astute scouting. Hidden gems do not have to cost £30m.The uncomfortable discussion is how much blame lies with Silva. His ability to change a game is a criticism levelled at our boss.The substitutes did not work on Sunday. Taking Sasa Lukic off for Tom Cairney damaged our defensive structure and we paid the price.There have been other missteps. A penchant for playing five at the back when it clearly nullified any attacking shape only really worked once - in a win against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. In other games, it cost us.But truth be told, Fulham FC is far better with Marco Silva than without. So, if there is to be a next chapter, then changes must be made to the squad in the summer if Fulham are to shed their nearly men tag.Find more from Drew Heatley at Fulhamish, externalFulham 1-2 Chelsea - the fans' verdictpublished at 10:43 21 April10:43 21 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesWe asked for your thoughts after Saturday's Premier League game between Fulham and Chelsea.Here are some of your comments:Fulham fansWill: So many points lost from winning positions this year. Even if we had taken half of those, we would be a certainty for European football. A season of what might have been.Rob: After a dominant first half, we seemed scared in the second half. This is the most frustrated I have been this season. It was as if the players seemed weighed down with the expectation of finally doing the double over them.Robert: Always seems to be trouble when we score first.  The disappointing thing this season is our inconsistency, often caused by our failure to see games out.Chelsea fansGeorge: After a lacklustre first half devoid of ideas or incisive play, Pedro Neto seemed to galvanise the team to push on and never quit. Maybe the youthfulness told in the end and Fulham's legs ran out, but after a goal against the run of play from Fulham, it was great for us to get a win away from home and keep up the fight for the Champions League. This will hopefully be the trigger for an exciting run-in with all to play for. A must-win, won. Next!Alan: Woeful again. There is just no enthusiasm in the team. Cole Palmer just seems to be running round like a headless chicken and Nicolas Jackson is really out of his depth. Enzo Maresca's one and only plan is becoming tiresome now and lacks any excitement. All the back and sideways passing is becoming boring. Sixty years I have been a supporter, and I cannot think when it was this bad.Mick: Decent second half. Definitely need a striker getting on the end of all the crosses or they are just wasted. We got away with one.Catch up on the Premier League actionpublished at 08:31 21 April08:31 21 AprilHighlights and analysis from Sunday's four Premier League fixtures, plus the best of the action from the rest of the weekend.If you missed Match of the Day 2, catch up now on BBC iPlayer.And you can watch Saturday's Match of the Day here.Listen back to Sunday's full match commentaries on BBC Sounds:Ipswich Town 0-4 ArsenalManchester United 0-1 WolvesLeicester City 0-1 LiverpoolFulham 1-2 Chelsea: Another lead let slippublished at 18:06 20 April18:06 20 AprilMichael BeardmoreBBC Sport JournalistImage source, Getty ImagesOnly Ipswich have dropped more points from winning positions than the 25 Fulham have let slip this season - but this is the instance that will sting the Cottagers the most.Fulham might have thought they were ending years, nay decades, of derby despair with a first-ever league double over west London neighbours Chelsea in their grasp.But not only did the Blues' two late goals extend their almost interminable hold over this fixture, it also dealt a potentially fatal blow to Fulham's European hopes.Had they just held on to a handful of those dropped points across the season, Marco Silva's side would surely be assured of a first campaign on the continent since 2011-12.Indeed, had they clung on for victory against Chelsea, they would have been only three points behind the Blues and dreaming of perhaps the Europa League rather than its little sister.Regardless of what happens in the run-in, few would argue it has been another season of progress at Craven Cottage - but, having let leads slip so often, has it also been a missed opportunity?16:48 20 AprilMaresca 'very pleased' with 'more dynamic' second half after tactical change.

Our build-up was not at the same level."They started to play in our half. I really believe the result is very harsh for us but the second half was not our level and we lost the game."On limiting Chelsea: "That's true. But when you have so long without the ball, when you're used to having it, it is hard - even if they are not creating. Our organisation was good. But the two goals came from giving the ball away in a defensive moment."The clearance from Robinson was to an area that it cannot be and they equalised. But overall, we did not play our best in the second half."previous pagePage 1 of 42123456…42next pageHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright © 2025 BBC.
