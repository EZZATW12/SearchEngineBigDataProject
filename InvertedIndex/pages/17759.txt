I think there was an element of getting the tactics right and an element of grit and determination to stay in the fight," head coach Danny Wilson told BBC Radio London."The boys did that against a very good Saracens side at a venue where they would be 100% favourites."A win at the Recreation Ground on Saturday (15:05 GMT) would strengthen their grip on a spot for the end-of-season semi-finals."They're a very good side - [they have] unbelievable squad depth. The bench that they seem to be able to put out week in, week out is really impressive," Wilson said.Smith returns at fly-half with Benson on benchImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Jamie Benson came off the bench to kick 13 points for Harlequins against Saracens last weekendEngland prop Baxter starts in the front row alongside hooker Jack Walker and Titi Lamositele, with Irne Herbst and Stephan Lewies - captain for the day - in the second row.Cunningham-South at number eight is flanked by Jack Kenningham and Tom Lawday.Scrum-half Will Porter partners Smith at fly-half, with Luke Northmore and Oscar Beard at centre.Nick David and Argentina international Rodrigo Isgro on the wings and South African Tyrone Green at full-back make up the backline.Danny Care returns to the bench from injury alongside fly-half Jamie Benson, who came on to kick 13 points against Saracens.Full Bath v Harlequins teamsBath: De Glanville; Cokanasiga, Ojomoh, Redpath, Muir; Russell, Spencer; Obano, Dunn, Stuart, Molony, Ewells, Hill, Read, BarbearyReplacements: Annett, Van Wyk, Du Toit, Pepper, Underhill, Carr-Smith, Butt, CoetzeeHarlequins: T Green; Isgro, Beard, Northmore, David; Smith, Porter; Baxter, Walker, Lamositele, Herbst, Lewies, Kenningham, Lawday, Cunningham-SouthReplacements: Riley, Els, Jones, Launchbury, Hammond, Schmid, Care, BensonReferee: Anthony WoodthorpeRelated topicsRugby UnionBathHarlequinsTop storiesLive. Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win - latest & reaction10386 viewing10k viewingLive. World Snooker Championship - live text12866 viewing13k viewingNational power outage stops play at Madrid OpenPublished10 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
