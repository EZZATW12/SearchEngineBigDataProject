Right from the start, they've been saying it's not right, they shouldn't be doing it and it was not right for the football club.Tottenham are entitled to take it [furlough option] but of course it doesn't look right and it's never too late to do the right thing.They've listened to their fans as Liverpool did and they realised the damage it could've caused and reversed it. They've realised they're wrong and in the end you have to say 'well done for doing it'.Former Blackburn Rovers striker Chris Sutton on BBC Radio 5 LiveThey have taken their time. It seems to be the pressure from the Spurs fans and the public in general. Why has there been this change? They've reversed it out of embarrassment. Why did it take so long?With the Spurs situation, people look at the owners and they were telling us they're the eighth-richest club in the world. The truth is they have just caved in to fan and media pressure.Their plan initially was to furlough staff and that was the wrong plan.BBC Sport's Simon Stone on BBC Radio 5 LiveTottenham came under intense pressure from their own fans, those wider in football and the general public over their initial decision, but this reversal has been a longer time coming than many thought.People inside the club advised Levy that it was a bad move to start with, but it seems that sense has prevailed in the end.This is an example of how football and footballers are maybe held up to different standards to society. It was said at the time that companies who were of a similar size to Tottenham were using the job retention scheme that the government put in place.But football is different. Football pays its players a lot of money, football receives a lot of money from TV - therefore there is scrutiny that other businesses just do not have.Any club that goes down this route can understand that they will be left open to criticism.Around the BBCBBC Sport Premier LeagueRelated internet linksTottenham Hotspur official siteThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Top storiesLive. Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win - latest & reaction10366 viewing10k viewingLive. World Snooker Championship - live text13486 viewing13k viewingNational power outage stops play at Madrid OpenPublished11 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
