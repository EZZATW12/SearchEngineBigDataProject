We have been vocal in recent times around the need for meaningful funding to support female players from Afghanistan so that they can thrive despite not being able to play at home."Having previously contributed a significant sum to the Global Refugee Cricket Fund, we are encouraged that this positive step from the ICC will go even further."We want the Afghanistan women's team to continue being a beacon of hope for all women and girls."The ICC requires its full members, of which Afghanistan is one, to have a national women's team, but the men's team has retained its Test status, reached the semi-finals of last year's T20 World Cup and participated in the Champions Trophy earlier this year.England's game against Afghanistan at the tournament went ahead as scheduled, despite a group of MPs across various political parties asking England to boycott the match.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch on BBC iPlayer: Cricket's Forgotten TeamRelated topicsAfghanistanCricketMore on this storyGet cricket news sent straight to your phonePublished31 JanuaryTop storiesLive. Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win - latest & reaction9338 viewing9.3k viewingLive. World Snooker Championship - live text13189 viewing13k viewingNational power outage stops play at Madrid OpenPublished14 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
