I love my son. I may not like some of his ways - as I don't like some of your ways - but I love him," Eubank Sr told Sky Sports in the backstage area after his arrival.Just days ago, Eubank Jr had spoken about his "pain" after Eubank Sr called the fight a "circus" and his son a "disgrace".But in what will go down as an iconic and memorable moment in British boxing, the pair emerged from a car together when Eubank Jr arrived at the venue on Saturday.Thousands of fans inside the stadium watched on the big screens and let out an almighty gasp as the Eubanks appeared from an elevator together."Whether I am ringside or in his corner, I am here," Eubank Sr said.Cameras then panned to an equally shocked Benn in the dressing room.Eddie Hearn smiled to the cameras as fans jeered Benn's promoter.Eubank Sr beat Conor Benn's father, Nigel Benn, in 1990, before a contentious draw three years later.While Nigel has been an ever-present throughout the build-up, Eubank Sr has criticised the fight because of a weight difference between the two fighters.Eubank outpoints bitter rival Benn in emotional fightPublished1 day ago'Legendary behaviour' - Relive Eubank's win over Benn'My father thinks I'm a disgrace' - Eubank reveals painPublished3 days agoEmotional, ferocious Eubank v Benn fight in picturesPublished1 day agoImage source, BoxxerImage caption, Eubank Sr had objected to the weight disparity in the fightImage source, MatchroomImage caption, Eubank Jr and Sr will encounter Conor Benn and his father NigelImage source, BoxxerImage caption, Eubank Jr is the favourite against Benn as the bigger and more experienced fighterThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Relationship with dad more important than boxing - BennRelated topicsBoxingBoxing schedule and results 2025Published1 day agoWatch every Born to Brawl episodePublished28 April 2024More boxing from the BBCNotifications, social media and more with BBC SportPublished31 JanuaryTop storiesLive. Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win - latest & reaction10240 viewing10k viewingLive. World Snooker Championship - live text15775 viewing16k viewingNational power outage stops play at Madrid OpenPublished16 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
