There is no information on the nature of his illness.New Zealand's Parker, 33, will instead fight Congolese Martin Bakole, who has been drafted in as a late replacement."If he is ill, I hope he gets better soon and I'm looking forward to Saturday and having a great show," Parker said before learning of the replacement.Parker later told Sky Sports, external: "He did a sensible thing. If you're sick, don't fight."There's no point going out there and fighting your heart out and you're not in the right physical shape. Go out there and fight when you're at peak, top shape, top condition, and put on your best performance. Put your best foot forward and the one that everyone will remember."Dubois has won 22 pro fights with two defeats. He won the 'interim' IBF title against Filip Hrgovic and was elevated to world champion when Oleksandr Usyk vacated the belt.The Londoner made a first defence of his belt by stopping Anthony Joshua in five rounds at Wembley Stadium in September.Parker has a record of 35 wins and three defeats. He held the WBO heavyweight title between 2016 and 2018.The highly rated 31-year-old Bakole, who is based in Scotland, has lost once in 22 bouts with 16 knockouts.The contest is the chief support to the undisputed light-heavyweight fight between champion Artur Beterbiev and Dmitry Bivol.Also on the card, Briton Hamzah Sheeraz challenges Carlos Adames for the WBC middleweight title.Knockout Brit with chat show dreams - Sheeraz eyes stardomPublished21 February5 Live Boxing with Bunce: Bakole replaces DuboisCredible replacement but a huge blow for Dubois - analysisImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Parker attended Thursday's news conference without DuboisWell, they do say you should expect the unexpected in heavyweight boxing.Rumours of Dubois' illness began to circulate at 17:10 GMT. Warren did not even reference Dubois at an undercard news conference just after 18:00.But Dubois was a no-show an hour later at the main news conference. Warren said he was being assessed by doctors, while a deflated Parker insisted he would remain on the card.To sum up the craziness, as Parker left the stage he told BBC Radio 5 Live he had heard no update on Dubois' withdrawal and no other opponents had been mentioned.Minutes later, Bakole was announced on social media as the replacement.Bakole is a highly credible opponent and the winner will likely get their title shot at some point - it's a decent fight. But it's not a world title fight. For British interest, and Dubois especially, it is thoroughly disappointing.Illnesses happen and fighters pull out, but for it to happen so close to fight night is rare. However, it's the second withdrawal in fight week of what was billed as the greatest card in the history of the sport.Of course, with the depth of this card, there is plenty still to look forward to - most notable is Beterbiev-Bivol II, two of the world's greatest pound-for-pound fighters facing off.Related topicsBoxingBoxing schedule and results 2025Published1 day agoWatch every Born to Brawl episodePublished28 April 2024More boxing from the BBCNotifications, social media and more with BBC SportPublished31 JanuaryComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 473Top storiesLive. '100% better than last time' - Reaction as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions7421 viewing7.4k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published11 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published2 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign language'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
