and with a game to spare - in front of Hollywood co-owners Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney.Defeat ended Charlton's hopes of automatic promotion, with Nathan Jones' side - who are fifth - now turning their attention to the play-offs.Wrexham's remarkable rise - and what comes nextPublished1 day agoWrexham owners 'deserve' success - ParkinsonPublished1 day agoReynolds takes selfies with fans before crunch gamePublished1 day agoImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Rob McElhenney (left) and Ryan Reynolds' takeover of Wrexham was finalised in February 2021Parkinson went with the same starting XI and substitutes from Monday's crucial 2-1 triumph over Blackpool at Bloomfield Road.His opposite number Jones, who labelled Wrexham a "circus" in the build-up to the fixture, made two changes from his team's 4-0 demolition of Wycombe as Tennai Watson and Karoy Anderson replaced Thierry Small and Luke Berry.Wycombe's slip-up played a key role in ensuring the home faithful lifted the noise levels well before kick-off in north Wales.But following a run of 15 wins from their past 20 league games, Charlton's supporters were in fine fettle themselves as their side also went into the game still in the mix to finish second behind champions Birmingham City.And the opening stages typified a contest between two evenly-matched teams with a huge amount at stake - with no noteworthy goalmouth action for either side.That was until a pivotal three-minute period in which Wrexham took a firm stronghold in the contest.Charlton survived a major scare on 15 minutes as - having hoped for an offside flag to come to their rescue - Macaulay Gillesphey put in a last-ditch challenge to prevent Smith from getting a shot on goal.But Wrexham scored from the resulting corner as the ball was fed to Rathbone whose low drilled effort flew beyond Will Mannion from just outside the 18-yard box.It was the 28-year-old's second goal in as many matches and eighth of the campaign on what was his 350th career appearance.And the home side were in dreamland moments later as Matty James' floated ball over the top of the Charlton defence fell to Smith who stretched to volley into the net.It prompted wild scenes of celebration, and subsequent chants of 'Doo doo doo, football in a circus' to the tune of Black Lace's Do The Conga from the Wrexham faithful in response to Jones' pre-match comments.Charlton looked shell-shocked, but as Wrexham grew more content to sit deeper and stay compact having established a two-goal cushion, the visitors enjoyed more possession and territory.Matty Godden's goal-bound flick was well blocked by Dan Scarr before Arthur Okonkwo superbly denied Watson with his legs from a one-on-one position just after the half-hour mark.Tyreece Campbell then had a shot blocked as Wrexham's defensive effort typified why they have kept more clean sheets than any other side in the third tier this season.Charlton needed at least three second-half goals to keep their top-two hopes alive, a task that appeared all the more daunting given Wrexham had lost just twice in 22 home league matches this season.As was the case from the beginning of the first 45 minutes, neither side created any openings in the early stages of the second half.Jones sent on Micah Mbick and Daniel Kanu in place of Lloyd Jones and Karoy Anderson as his side looked for a route back in the contest.Parkinson responded by replacing Jay Rodriguez with Steven Fletcher as Wrexham looked to see out the final 20 minutes.Charlton continued to push in the final stages without overly troubling Okonkwo.And Wrexham put the icing on the promotion cake as Smith headed Max Cleworth's cross into the net in the 81st minute to seal a 16th and final home league victory of the campaign and a return to the second tier for the first time since the 1981-82 season.Charlton sign off the regular season at home against Burton Albion as they prepare for the play-offs.Wrexham - who were in non-league in 2022-23 - travel to Lincoln City on the same day as they bid to round off yet another memorable campaign in style.Post-match reactionWrexham boss Phil Parkinson:"It's amazing. The key for me today is how we've done it."The performance today was really controlled and, at times, high quality and I'm so pleased with that because getting over the line in football is hard."Having the control and mentality to produce a performance of that standard in such a pressure game is an enormous credit to everybody."Charlton Athletic boss Nathan Jones:"It's a tough one. Congratulations to Wrexham, they were excellent today."They did the basics far better than us, they were more clinical than us, and they probably outworked us."We came up against a good side today that were at the top of their game. It's been a difficult one to take today."But we've been on a fantastic run and we've managed to secure the play-offs which we did a few weeks ago."Related topicsCharlton AthleticLeague OneWrexhamFootballComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 1291League One Scores & FixturesSaturday 26th AprilBristol Rovers 0 , Reading 2 at Full timeBristol RoversBristol RoversBristol Rovers02ReadingReadingReadingFull timeFTLeyton Orient 1 , Wycombe Wanderers 0 at Full timeL OrientLeyton OrientLeyton Orient10WycombeWycombe WanderersWycombe WanderersFull timeFTBarnsley 1 , Shrewsbury Town 2 at Full timeBarnsleyBarnsleyBarnsley12ShrewsburyShrewsbury TownShrewsbury TownFull timeFTBurton Albion 2 , Cambridge United 1 at Full timeBurton AlbionBurton AlbionBurton Albion21Cambridge UtdCambridge UnitedCambridge UnitedFull timeFTCrawley Town 3 , Northampton Town 0 at Full timeCrawleyCrawley TownCrawley Town30NorthamptonNorthampton TownNorthampton TownFull timeFTExeter City 3 , Huddersfield Town 1 at Full timeExeterExeter CityExeter City31HuddersfieldHuddersfield TownHuddersfield TownFull timeFTPeterborough United 1 , Bolton Wanderers 1 at Full timePeterboroughPeterborough UnitedPeterborough United11BoltonBolton WanderersBolton WanderersFull timeFTStockport County 3 , Lincoln City 2 at Full timeStockportStockport CountyStockport County32LincolnLincoln CityLincoln CityFull timeFTWigan Athletic 1 , Blackpool 1 at Full timeWiganWigan AthleticWigan Athletic11BlackpoolBlackpoolBlackpoolFull timeFTWrexham 3 , Charlton Athletic 0 at Full timeWrexhamWrexhamWrexham30CharltonCharlton AthleticCharlton AthleticFull timeFTView all League One fixturesLeague One TableOn Saturday 26th AprilSkip to table keyMatch Participants:Wrexham, Position 2, Points 89Charlton Athletic, Position 5, Points 82TeamPlayedWonDrawnLostGoals ForGoals AgainstGoal DifferencePointsForm, Last 6 games, Oldest first1Birmingham City433193763046102WResult WinWResult WinWResult WinDResult DrawWResult WinWResult Win2Wrexham452611865343189DResult DrawWResult WinDResult DrawDResult DrawWResult WinWResult Win3Stockport County452412969412884WResult WinWResult WinWResult WinDResult DrawWResult WinWResult Win4Wycombe Wanderers452412969422784LResult LossWResult WinWResult WinWResult WinLResult LossLResult Loss5Charlton Athletic4524101164422282WResult WinDResult DrawWResult WinWResult WinWResult WinLResult Loss6Leyton Orient452361668472175DResult DrawWResult WinWResult WinWResult WinWResult WinWResult Win7Reading4521121266531375WResult WinWResult WinDResult DrawLResult LossWResult WinWResult Win8Bolton Wanderers45207186669-367WResult WinLResult LossLResult LossLResult LossLResult LossDResult Draw9Blackpool4416161268571164WResult WinWResult WinLResult LossWResult WinLResult LossDResult Draw10Huddersfield Town45197195751664WResult WinLResult LossLResult LossLResult LossLResult LossLResult Loss11Lincoln City4516131664541061WResult WinDResult DrawDResult DrawWResult WinWResult WinLResult Loss12Barnsley451610196571-658LResult LossLResult LossWResult WinLResult LossDResult DrawLResult Loss13Exeter City451511194962-1356LResult LossDResult DrawWResult WinDResult DrawLResult LossWResult Win14Rotherham United441510195157-655WResult WinWResult WinWResult WinLResult LossDResult DrawLResult Loss15Stevenage441510194048-855LResult LossWResult WinLResult LossLResult LossWResult WinLResult Loss16Wigan Athletic441315163840-254DResult DrawDResult DrawDResult DrawWResult WinWResult WinDResult Draw17Peterborough United441312196575-1051WResult WinLResult LossLResult LossDResult DrawDResult DrawDResult Draw18Northampton Town451214194765-1850LResult LossWResult WinDResult DrawLResult LossWResult WinLResult Loss19Mansfield Town43139215367-1448WResult WinLResult LossLResult LossLResult LossDResult DrawLResult Loss20Burton Albion441113204762-1546WResult WinLResult LossWResult WinDResult DrawLResult LossWResult Win21Crawley Town451110245582-2743LResult LossLResult LossLResult LossDResult DrawWResult WinWResult Win22Bristol Rovers45127264372-2943LResult LossLResult LossLResult LossDResult DrawLResult LossLResult Loss23Cambridge United45911254471-2738DResult DrawWResult WinLResult LossWResult WinLResult LossLResult Loss24Shrewsbury Town4589284077-3733LResult LossLResult LossDResult DrawLResult LossLResult LossWResult WinView latest League One tableKeyPosition 1 - 2 : PromotionPosition 3 - 6 : Promotion Play-offPosition 21 - 24 : RelegationLast Updated 26th April 2025 at 19:22Please Note: All times UK.
