The 2025 world snooker champion will receive a cheque for £500,000."The Crucible's been a big part of my life and a big part of snooker's life," Hearn said, "but it has to move with the times and someone, whether it's government or Sheffield, have to come up with a way of showing us that they're going to treat us with respect and give us the type of facilities we require."It's as simple as that. It's not complicated."All parties involved said prior to this year's ongoing World Championship there would be no announcement about a future contract during the tournament.Quiz: What happened in round one at the Crucible?Published3 days agoNo imminent decision to be made on Crucible futurePublished8 AprilWhat is the Crucible curse?Published17 AprilTradition or money - what do players really want?The World Championship had lived a nomadic existence before promoter Mike Watterson took it to the Crucible almost half a century ago, heeding the advice of his wife, Carole, who had watched a play in the theatre and felt it had just the right attributes to stage a snooker event.It is where the sport's most famous moments have been witnessed, and for many it has become almost synonymous with the tournament itself.This is far from the first time a move away from Sheffield has been mooted, or that similar messages have come from Matchroom, yet the 50th anniversary of its first World Championship could well mark a farewell to the city.China and Saudi Arabia have been linked with bids to stage the tournament, which could also move elsewhere in the UK.Eddie Hearn, who has built the boxing arm of Matchroom to great effect, is openly "not a snooker guy".The 45-year-old says snooker is "leaving a huge amount of money on the table" by staying faithful to the Crucible. He says it could sell 4,000 tickets for each session elsewhere if the sport moves away from its traditions.He said: "I think World Snooker and my dad have been unbelievably loyal to the game and to the venue and to the dream of the Crucible, but at some point you've got to say we can provide greater opportunities for our players and life-changing opportunities."If there's a way to keep it in Sheffield, of course that's the preferred option. But ultimately, behind closed doors, trust me on one thing: the players want more money and that's the same in any sport you work in."Related topicsSnookerMore on this storyWhite and Fu awarded invitational tour cardsPublished3 days agoReturning O'Sullivan feared Crucible 'meltdown'Published4 days agoWorld Championship: Schedule, results & BBC coveragePublished13 hours agoComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 734Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8972 viewing9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
