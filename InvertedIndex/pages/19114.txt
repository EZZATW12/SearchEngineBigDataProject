"They looked miles off it in terms of fight, spirit and everything you would want."It's not like all of a sudden there's going to be a wake-up call and these players are going to start playing. If that was ever going to be the case, why haven't they done it up until this point?"I wasn't expecting a massive change but I at least thought there would be a bit more fight and determination. It was a resignation in terms of relegation - everyone had seen it coming for weeks leading up to it."Leicester took the Championship by storm in 2023-24 but have not been able to transfer the positivity from that campaign into a Premier League survival bid."It's going to take a lot to turn this around," Fryatt said. "The Championship shouldn't be feared but there should be things in place to make sure they have got a good foundation. They are a long way from where they once were, but they can get back to that by making important decisions."A lot of it will depend on things financially because, for example, sacking two managers in one financial year is a huge hit - but something needs to be done."I didn't see anything in this performance that made me think Ruud is the right person to lead this team. Forget his illustrious playing career - he is an unproven manager and he has never been down at the bottom."The team looks soulless. They are lacking identity, style and fight."Listen to the full podcast on BBC SoundsWolves 3-0 Leicester City - the fans' verdictpublished at 08:1608:16Image source, Getty ImagesWe asked for your thoughts after Saturday's Premier League game between Wolves and Leicester City at Molineux.Here are some of your replies:Wolves fansSara: Wolves made Leicester look woeful. The fitness levels between the two teams were clear to see. There are happy people in Wolverhampton at last. Matheus Cunha was the standout - he just wants to please the fans! I hope he stays.Steve: Cunha is going to be jumping off a ship sailing to much better times and joining the Titanic.Cordelia: Thank you Vitor Pereira for coming to Wolves and giving our players the confidence to play and show off their skills. We always knew they were quality but now everyone can see it. Leicester fans - good luck next season.Kieran: What a run. We need to buy Vitor lots of pints - what a turnaround! If we back this man in the summer, just think of what we could do.Espirito: People are praising this team like they have beaten a team at the top of the table, but we have not. We should be beating teams like this to little fanfare and it just shows how far the club has fallen. We don't need nor want Cunha. Let another team deal with his attitude. The same goes for Jose Sa and Toti, otherwise we will be in this position again.Leicester fansChris: We are 'using these games to prepare for next season' according to Ruud van Nistelrooy. So obviously picking loan player Facundo Buonanotte who definitely won't be with us next season and giving Jamie Vardy another 90 minutes when we know he is leaving makes perfect sense, right? The whole club is a joke. As for the performance, I don't think the players could have put less effort in if they tried. But not trying is a bit of a theme.Nathan: Is this the worst and most unlikable Premier League team ever? Yes. A record-breakingly bad manager, a board that seems not to care, and players who seemingly cannot play the game. Can we just forfeit the remaining games because we will lose them all by at least three goals and will be unable to score?Tom: One word: awful. From top to bottom, it's toxic. We need new owners, management, coaches and players. It is going to be a long few seasons with hard times and hard work to get the club stable at the least.Christy: A club in all sorts of trouble. The manager appears to be clueless, the players nowhere near the standard required, the coaching staff do not seem to understand this standard and the people who run the club make far too many errors. They should really think about putting Leicester City up for sale.Catch up on the Premier League actionpublished at 12:29 27 April12:29 27 AprilMark Chapman presents highlights and analysis from Saturday's five Premier League fixtures, which saw Ipswich Town's relegation from the top-flight confirmed.If you missed Match of the Day, you can catch up now on BBC iPlayer.Listen back to full match commentary from Newcastle United 3-0 Ipswich Town on BBC Sounds.18:29 26 AprilNot acceptable, attitude doesn't require talent - Nistelrooy.

I don't talk about it football-wise, but I talk about it in terms of intensity and duels. We had many easy ball losses in possession, especially in the first half."In the second half, yes we conceded two goals on the break but we were better in those areas. But today wasn't good enough."On making a triple change at half-time: "At half-time, Facundo [Buonanotte] had to come off with concussion. Ricardo Pereira had to come off with an injury. Then before half-time, Bobby De-Cordova Reid had to come off as well. It is a shame and shows how tough this season has been, with [Stephy] Mavididi also getting injured. Now those two are injured and there's a concussion."We are fighting towards the end of the season."On what he said to the players at half-time: "I had to address the things I shared with you, that it is not acceptable. How intense you press, how intense you make a duel and how easy the ball losses are that are going to create lots of transitions where you have to recover. Those things don't require talent. "That was addressed and then we went into the second half where we had the penalty with Jamie [Vardy]. That was so unfortunate. I really wanted him to score to get us back into the game, but also for himself. That summed the game up."The Brighton and Liverpool games were positive, but today was not so it isn't consistent enough. Also, it is a matter of course to keep that motivation and focus going for the team."There is a lot to play for, like Jamie [Vardy]'s last games. Supporting our captain should be enough motivation to push out everything that is left."We look at the 17 teams above us and acknowledge that we weren't at that level. That is very clear - we have to accept it and move on."Wolves 3-0 Leicester City: Key statspublished at 18:03 26 April18:03 26 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesLeicester City have conceded first in 29 of their 34 Premier League games this season, the most by any side in a single 38-game campaign in the competition.The Foxes have lost 24 Premier League games this season.

Charlotte are currently top of the Eastern Conference.14:19 25 April'I named my daughter after Vardy - we'll miss him', published at 14:19 25 April'I named my daughter after Vardy - we'll miss him'AttributionLeicestershire'Vardy is their hero' - Albrighton pays tributepublished at 09:53 25 April09:53 25 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesFormer Leicester City winger Mark Albrighton says his ex-team-mate Jamie Vardy, who this week announced that he will be departing the Foxes at the end of his season, is a hero."I wouldn't say it is a sad day but certainly one that a lot of fans will be struggling to come to terms with and that is fully understandable," he said on the Leicester City Football Forum podcast."You speak to fans, and get a picture of their last 10 years. Some of them started supporting through the good times, and these are young kids, and Jamie Vardy is their hero."All of a sudden, they are going to come to games and he is not going to be there and that is going to be difficult to accept."Albrighton, who was part of Leicester's Premier League title-winning side in 2016 alongside Vardy, says that given the striker's mentality, it is no surprise that he has opted to leave the club after they were relegated from the top tier this term."I spoke to him after the game against Liverpool at the weekend and he more or less told me his plans," he said."It wasn't a shock to me, but I think he felt the timing was right. "He would have wanted to do it in better circumstances, and he felt the relationship there had run its course. It's now time for Jamie and Leicester to move on to new things."I look back at when I called it [time on my career] and I couldn't have had it any better."I look at this and yeah, it might just take the gloss off it in terms of the relegation, but I think there is enough time between now and the end of the season to appreciate what he did for the football club."Listen to the full episode on BBC SoundsVardy's five finest Foxes momentspublished at 08:53 25 April08:53 25 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Vardy celebrating after scoring against Nottingham Forest on the way to sealing Leicester City's promotion to the Premier League in 2014.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Vardy breaking Ruud van Nistelrooy's record for consecutive Premier League goals in November 2015, scoring in 11 games in a row for the Foxes.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Vardy lifting the Premier League trophy at King Power Stadium on 7 May 2016, having won the title under former manager Claudio Ranieri.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Vardy scoring during Leicester City's Champions League quarter-final second leg against Atletico Madrid on 18 April 2017.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Vardy after winning Leicester City's first-ever FA Cup on 15 May 2021.'Vardy is an old-fashioned, working-class hero'published at 08:05 25 April08:05 25 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesFormer Leicester chairman Jon Holmes has been reflecting on "extraordinary character" Jamie Vardy's career at the club after it was announced on Thursday the striker would be leaving at the end of the season.Speaking on BBC Radio Leicester's Football Forum, Holmes said: "I've been watching since 1957, the hero then was Arthur Rowley. At the end of that season he unexpectedly left and Rowley is our second-highest scorer. We have now reached the situation where we have the third-highest scorer leaving the game and that is Jamie Vardy."He is truly a legend of the club. What he has done for Leicester in the last 13 years is extraordinary. The way he has conducted himself, he is a true hero. He is an extraordinary character who has brought so much joy to Leicester fans. Joy to me, I have to say."He is a player you watch and he makes you smile, makes you laugh, you can empathise with him and he shows all his emotions. Truly, he is player that not only looks like a player but he looks like one of the fans. When he plays, all his emotions come out."Vardy is an old-fashioned, working-class hero if you like."He is the kid form Sheffield, came to us and looked rough and ready. He looked like a player that had come from outside the league."The first season, I can remember watching him and, although there were bits there that were raw and he did score a few goals, he looked out of place. He didn't look like he was going to make the step up. Apparently he felt that himself at the end of that season."But, the first game of the next season, we played Middlesbrough away and he scored the winner in what became a signature goal for him. On the way back, I phoned Alan Birchenall and I said 'we have a new player'. That was the start."Listen back to the full show on BBC Sounds 'Do the right thing and build the statue'published at 18:23 24 April18:23 24 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesWe asked for your views on Foxes legend Jamie Vardy's decision to depart when Leicester's season ends.Here are some of your comments:Alex: You can use many words but the best one is legend. What Vardy has brought to Leicester is more than any other fanbase will realise, not just the goals but the passion, love for the club and helping us winning trophies. We've seen him grow from that non-league player to our greatest ever to wear the shirt. Do the right thing Leicester and build the statue of him outside the stadium.Tom: One word. Legend. Best player we have had in my lifetime and I doubt there will be anyone who comes close. From the wonder goal against Liverpool to winning the league and going on a European tour - all would not have been possible without Vardy. I will miss him winding up away supporters, particularly Spurs. Good luck Jamie, and please come back in a management role of some sort and fix this mess.Philip: He has served the club brilliantly. I will remember him bullying Manchester United in 2014. I was sat in a Greek bar, six Man Utd fans and me - what a great game for him! Many great memories, but above all, his loyalty to the Foxes. My best wishes to a great wind up merchant!Linda: He means the world to us! We go to every home and away game, and at the away games we are always asked the same thing: 'Is Vardy playing?' Thank you Jamie for everything. It won't be the same without you.Vinny: I would have to say Vardy's never give up attitude and marksmanship at the peak of his powers make him stand out. He grew into his role at Leicester City. Initially, I thought he wouldn't be that spectacular - but his tenacity became unmatched in the Championship and then the Premier League. My most memorable performances from him were against Man Utd at home to turn the game on its head in a 5-3 win during the 'greatest escape' year and his spectacular volley against Liverpool on our way to the title the following season. A true Leicester great and the fiercest competitor. Graham: A true Leicester legend. He 100% Stuck by us over the years when he could have moved on but chose to stay out of respect and love for Leicester. He'll go down in our history forever.James: It's time. Some 13 years at any one club is virtually unheard of, not to mention all of the success he brought. For the sake of his legacy and reputation, it's for the best he goes on his terms before the fans start to turn. And like that, an era draws to a close, thanks for everything JV9, and good luck.'Fairytales do come true'published at 18:17 24 April18:17 24 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesFootball journalist Henry Winter has shared his tribute to Jamie Vardy after the Leicester striker confirmed he will leave the club at the end of the season."He's just one of life's characters," Winter told BBC Radio Leicester's fan forum."I don't think in the time I've known him he has particularly changed. He's down to earth, he's great fun, and look at what he has achieved, particularly from a slow start."It's nine years since the title run and it was just amazing."Everyone talks about his physical pace but there was a mental speed and agility that set him apart."He's got seven Premier League goals this season. It hasn't been a vintage season for him but it's not been a vintage season for the club."When you look at Jamie Vardy play, he does give everything. He leaves the field with sweat on his shirt every time. He's still got a role left in him with another club."I know Leicester fans and I know when he returns one day, even in the colours of another club, he will get a big salute because he absolutely deserves it. He is Leicester's greatest ever player."The legacy he will leave at the club is Foxes never quit. The legacy is for all of us in life - just never give up, persist, because fairytales do come true."17:36 24 April'A very unique character' - Vardy will 'never be forgotten' by Foxes, published at 17:36 24 April'A very unique character' - Vardy will 'never be forgotten' by FoxesAttributionLeicesterComments825'Perfect mix of fan and footballer'published at 15:58 24 April15:58 24 AprilKate BlakemoreFan writerImage source, Getty ImagesIt is hard to know where to start when writing about a GOAT as it is incredibly difficult to put down on paper. Honestly, it is impossible to say in a few short words how much joy this man has brought for me, my family and my football club.Jamie Vardy is the perfect amalgamation of fan and footballer - the kid that had dreams like all of us. It has been an honour to witness firsthand his 13-year highlight reel.I have listed a few of my personal favourites here (in no particular order as that is too hard):Manchester United at home in 2014 - his first Premier League goal in an unforgettable 5-3 victoryWest Bromwich Albion away in 2015 - an injury-time winner; a major factor in the 'Great Escape' seasonLiverpool at home in 2016 - a tremendous volley on the road to the title.When one thinks of Vardy, what immediately comes to mind is an abundance of ability, pace, character, tenacity and 'celebration engagement' with the away fans. The flying eagle against Crystal Palace, 'howl' to Wolves fans, corner flag guitar playing, running the length of the pitch to bow to the away fans, his '1-0' to Tottenham fans only as recently as January, and there is many more. As an away supporter, he is the man that you hate to love and love to hate.But aside from all that, Vardy has been the spearhead of an era where all of our dreams became a reality, including his own.A non-league £1m 'punt' by Nigel Pearson in 2012, soon followed by a 5,000-1 win of the Premier League title and reaching the Champions League quarter-finals. He led us through it all as a true professional. His impact and loyalty to this club will be unrivalled during my lifetime.Vardy puts personality in football, something that has sadly become a dying breed, and he showed his unmatched loyalty to the club when 'better' offers were on the table. He is Leicester's heartbeat and now, in this sad moment of relegation, it is time to move on and find a new sign of life.Don't cry because it is over, smile because it happened.Find more from Kate Blakemore at Leicester Till I Die, externalNot a Leicester fan?

It's a simple yes or no...AttributionLeicesterVan Nistelrooy on Vardy leaving, 'special' conversation and own futurepublished at 14:56 24 April14:56 24 AprilNicola PearsonBBC Sport journalistLeicester City boss Ruud van Nistelrooy has been speaking to the media before Saturday's Premier League game against Wolves (kick-off 15:00 BST).Here are the key lines from his news conference:Captain Jamie Vardy came and spoke to Van Nistelrooy on Wednesday about his decision to leave at the end of the season and the Leicester boss said the conversation was "special": "From person to person, former striker to former striker and from manager to player, it was impressive - like his career. The love for the football club comes through in every word he says."He continued: "[Vardy] felt really supported by fans from the beginning. Over the 13 years he played, many highs and lows. What stands out is the loyalty to the football club. Taking responsibility for the football club and being the best he can be to preform. He was there through thick and thin, providing typical Vardy ways of playing - aggressive, quick, intuitional. Of course, [you are] a fan's favourite when you play like that and can score goals like that."Van Nistelrooy believes Vardy's career is a "remarkable story" and that it is "fair to say he is the best player ever to play for this football club", adding: "The most impact on all the successes that they have had over the past 13 years. He is four games away from 500 games for the football club, two goals from 200 goals for football club. Those figures say a lot. When you put silverware next to them, then you have a complete picture."On if Vardy's decision can galvanise the players in remaining games: "His farewell is above anything. He deserves all the credit and honour possible from the club towards him, the squad towards him, the supporters towards him and all people who love football towards him. It is all in focus of that and that is how we will move forward."Van Nistelrooy denied any conversations with the ownership have taken place this week, but that the board are aware of his plans from previous discussions: "To move forward and to bring the club back and build back up with the people in this building. I am waiting for the club to come back and say OK, in the sense of when can we start to look for the alignment needed. The quicker, the better."On opponents Wolves and the job Vitor Pereira has done: "They have done well. The manager has done an excellent job coming in this winter. I think they have invested, not sure how much, but they reinforced the squad on top of a squad that is already good and has had a long time in the Premier League. All credit to them."Follow all of the reaction to Vardy's leaving announcementVardy confirms he is not retiringpublished at 14:29 24 April14:29 24 AprilNick MashiterBBC Sport football news reporter Image source, Getty ImagesFollowing the announcement that he will be leaving Leicester at the end of the season, Jamie Vardy has confirmed he has no plans to retire after his departure in the summer.The striker will turn 39 in January but he has no plans to quit having scored 232 goals in 536 appearances for Fleetwood and the Foxes."This isn't retirement - I want to keep playing and doing what I enjoy doing most, scoring goals," he said. "Hopefully there's one or two more for Leicester between now and the end of the season and many more in the future."I may be 38 but I've still got the desire and ambition to achieve so much more."previous pagePage 1 of 41123456…41next pageHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright © 2025 BBC.
