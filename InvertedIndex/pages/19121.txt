These are supposedly 'professional' footballers - I think they need to take a long hard look at themselves in the mirror. I've seen more skill and passion from non-league sides.Oliver: A game of two halves - the nostalgic Southampton of then and the daunting Southampton of now. Simon Rusk has elevated us from 'that bad' to 'not that bad', and we looked like dominant for the first 45 minutes. Unfortunately, the second half underscored our disappointing season and the sad reality that lesser sides like Fulham, among others, have overtaken us. It left me with doubt that we could ever return to our glory days.Bill: I'm not sure how many time Jan Bednarek has cost us points this season. I realise that at times he has saved us, but sadly neither he nor Jack Stephens are Premier League standard and they never have been. Our defence was tired and disorganised but I wasn't aware of any forwards having a pop at goal. If you don't shoot you won't score! I'm not sure why folk thought Ross Stewart was the prodigal son returning. I've not seen anything to persuade me of his value to the club. Sell him!Marc: Stephens was a gladiator - he gave it his all. It's a shame the rest of his team couldn't be bothered. Super Jack Stephens.Fulham fansMatthew: A pretty poor performance, particularly in the first half. Many individual errors throughout the whole game and we were very lucky that Southampton had no threat. Credit where it's due for Southampton's gameplan, but also the Fulham substitutes were impactful. I also felt Southampton's substitute of Stewart for Cameron Archer really helped Fulham. A win is a win!Richard: Three points, but what a struggle to get there. They are not likely to make Europe - they are just too inconsistent and conceding late goals has been their undoing.Will: We never make it easy for ourselves. We need Crystal Palace to lose the FA Cup final for eighth place to be good enough. We need to do all that we can to keep our position.Michael: I really can't understand why Marco Silva keeps playing Andreas Pereira because he makes very little contribution to the overall game. Time and time again he fails to make a decent cross from a corner and worse still his free kicks are consistently poor. His unnecessary tackle in the 17th minute gifted Southampton their first attempt. Time to go, I think.Rusk emergence 'should be seen as a positive'published at 08:1408:14Laura KenyonFinal Score reporterImage source, Getty ImagesAs if Southampton did not already know just how brutal Premier League football can be, Ryan Sessegnon's late winner was a painful reminder.As the clocked ticked down, reporters watching on were primed to praise another point gained under interim boss, Simon Rusk.A team, already relegated, but seemingly transformed – or at least much improved – under Rusk's leadership. Put the Fulham result aside, one cannot help but think Rusk is doing enough to at least be considered for the permanent role with Adam Lallana in tow.Articulate press conferences, noticeable improvements on the pitch and the fans seeming to warm to him. In a season of negatives for Southampton, the emergence of Rusk into the limelight should be seen as a positive - even if he returns to his under-21s role.Catch up on the Premier League actionpublished at 12:29 27 April12:29 27 AprilMark Chapman presents highlights and analysis from Saturday's five Premier League fixtures, which saw Ipswich Town's relegation from the top-flight confirmed.If you missed Match of the Day, you can catch up now on BBC iPlayer.Listen back to full match commentary from Newcastle United 3-0 Ipswich Town on BBC Sounds.'I've found it tough but I know how hard I've worked to get back'published at 21:18 26 April21:18 26 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesSouthampton striker Ross Stewart has been speaking to BBC Radio Solent after earning his first home start of the season: "On a personal note, I'm very pleased. It's been a long time since I last started a game. I've had really bad luck with injuries over the past couple of years and it's been really tough on me."I've found it tough but I know how hard I've worked to get back to this stage. I completed 65 minutes and felt good during it so I think that's a positive personally."I think the difficulty has just been the constant setbacks. It's never easy being injured and the last two years have been the first time in my career where I've had to deal with this sort of thing. Every time you build yourself up to a place and you get a knockback, it's probably tougher."There have been a lot of dark days and a lot of solo days where you are having to work behind the scenes. You just want to play football."I would have liked to have done it during a win but we just got so unlucky at the end. We dug in so well and on another day, we would probably get something from that game."I really enjoyed just playing football today - result aside. So it's a positive to be back out there and hopefully I can continue to be a part of this team for the rest of this season."On Fulham's defensive line: "Both of their centre-backs are big boys and quality players as well. It was a tough afternoon but I thought we did well for the first 60 minutes. We were well in the game and then we probably found ourselves defending more than we would have liked."We invited the pressure and in the end, when you're up against a quality team with quality players, like Fulham, they can always find the goals. Conceding late goals sucks, there is no other way around it. "So it's disappointing, but the fight was definitely there. We aren't going to let this season die because there are still games to play and points to be earned."Listen to the full interview hereSouthampton still risking unwanted Premier League recordpublished at 18:54 26 April18:54 26 AprilAdwaidh RajanBBC Sport journalistImage source, Getty ImagesWith only four minutes of added time remaining, it looked like relegated Southampton were about to secure a vital point against Fulham at St Mary's Stadium on Saturday. The result would have been the first time the Saints avoided defeat in back-to-back league games this season. And more importantly, it would have helped the bottom side move to 12 points and avoid the ignominy of sharing the record for the fewest points in a Premier League season with Derby County, who ended with 11 points in 2007-08.But a late header from Ryan Sessegnon condemned them to their 27th defeat of the season - a result that was even more painful for the Saints faithful after they had seen their side open the scoring through captain Jack Stephens. Southampton, under interim manager Simon Rusk, will next travel to Leicester City, who will play alongside them in the Championship next season. The Saints had became the first team in Premier League history to be relegated with as many as seven games remaining earlier this month.And the meeting with the Foxes will assume even more significance now as it could be their last realistic chance of getting a point to avoid both the unwanted record and the moniker of the worst team in Premier League history.They will then finish their campaign with games against Manchester City, Everton and Arsenal before trying to rebuild in the Championship next term. 'We need to digest it and bounce back'published at 18:33 26 April18:33 26 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesSouthampton interim manager Simon Rusk has been speaking to BBC Sport following the defeat: "It is a cruel game. Last week we scored a late goal, this week we conceded a late goal. Of course it is a tough one to take, but we need to digest it and bounce back."I feel like there is much more effort and desire from the players and they are giving maximum effort in these games. Whether we deserved more or not, I think it evens out in the end. We just have to keep going and trying to improve."We need to take what was good from the game and take it into the next one. The overriding feeling at the minute is one of disappointment."On Jack Stephens' goal: "Yes, delighted for him. He has been a real captain for us in recent weeks so I'm happy that he has scored. It was a nice set piece goal."On hopes for the remainder of the season: "The main thing is that we have got the players fighting. I think the supporters can see that and have connected with that. We want to take one game at a time, get as many points on the board as possible, and finish as strongly and positively as possible."18:12 26 April'It's a cruel game' - Southampton's Rusk on late defeat.

Fulham will be annoyed at letting their lead slip against Chelsea last time out, but they have got more quality than Southampton, and they will make it count.Sutton's prediction: 0-2Read the full predictions and have your say here'The journey to get there was arduous at times and long' - Ruskpublished at 18:34 24 April18:34 24 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesInterim manager Simon Rusk says he is "incredibly honoured" to lead Southampton after an "arduous" journey into management.Rusk, 43, has previously managed Stockport County and has also taken charge of England's Under-19s, as well has having taken interim charge of Saints for a spell in 2024.Asked how he feels to be at the helm again for a spell, he told media: "Incredibly honoured."You've sweat blood to have these moments in your career and you remember your story. We all remember our story, the times of adversity - everyone has that, not just football people, everyone has that."For sure, I've had my moments of reflection - not many, I've got to say, I've been quite busy. But the moments I have been able to sit and reflect and think about the journey to get here - however it's arrived - to manage in the Premier League for this football club and have the privilege."It is a privilege. Even as a manager, it's a privilege if you lose a game to be the one to get to speak to your players; it's a privilege to be able to have this voice in the media here; it's a privilege to be able to share my thoughts and feelings on whether it be the good times or the bad times that I'm experiencing in the short team; it's a privilege to lead the players."For sure, I've had my reflections around that and every single moment that I'm able to stand there on the sideline, I do remind myself as I'm sure everyone does - the journey to get there was arduous at times and long."I think it's right for everyone to have those moments where they reflect upon that and I'm certainly doing that at the minute."But there's a job to be done and as much as I'm not here just enjoying the ride. I believe in my abilities as a coach and a manager, I believe in my track record, I believe in my experiences, and I'm finding that balance of enjoying it, but also pushing myself."Rusk on 'self-esteem', managerial 'privilege' and Ugochukwupublished at 15:40 24 April15:40 24 AprilMillie SianBBC Sport journalistSouthampton interim boss Simon Rusk has been speaking to the media before Saturday's Premier League game against Fulham (kick-off 15:00 BST).Here are the key lines from his news conference:There were a few "knocks and niggles" after the 1-1 draw with West Ham United, but there is a "clean bill of health" going into this weekend's home game. There will be "a few decisions" to make around his starting XI and his bench, but it is a "good problem" to have.He will take achieving the best points-per-game ratio of any Southampton manager this season "with a pinch of salt". He explained: "The fundamental for us has been being together. We have been one group in terms of our goal and have been trying to turn that into performances on the pitch."His aim when taking on the interim managerial role was to "leave the team's self-esteem" better than when he found it. Therefore, he has been trying to "assess the positives" and not be "too cynical" about the club's position in the Premier League.Fulham will bring "a real challenge and a tough game" to St Mary's Stadium as they continue to fight for European football. He added: "We need to be spot on with our performance, and maybe need a little bit of luck, to get something out of the game. We know they have good qualities but we have to find the balance between preparing for that and focusing on our own preparation."When asked about the importance of finishing above Derby County's lowest-points record, he replied: "I'm not going to obsess over it. I can understand it - my head isn't in the sand - and hopefully we do take care of it, but that cannot be my main focus. It's negative energy and positive energy is what I'm going after at the minute."He feels "incredibly honoured" to have been given the opportunity to lead a Premier League team for the first time in his coaching career, adding: "I've had my moments of reflection - not many because I've been quite busy - but this is a privilege. Every single moment I have to stand on the sidelines, I do remind myself that the journey to get here was arduous and long."The club have been "up front and honest" with him about his current role and have given him "top drawer support" day-to-day. He remains "really open-minded" and "ambitious" about his career path.However, he didn't know too much about the manager shortlist that has been drawn up by the club because his "focus and attention" has been on the players and staff he is currently working with.Rusk feels Chelsea loanee Lesley Ugochukwu has "great potential" and he is pleased to have given him more minutes in recent games. He added: "He is a young player that has a very athletic profile. He is perhaps still finding his way in the game, in terms of regular Premier League football, but it does take time to feel it out and understand the new environment."Follow all of Thursday's Premier League news conferences and the rest of the day's football newsDisplay at West Ham 'a sign of things to come'?published at 12:36 22 April12:36 22 AprilRay HuntFan writerImage source, Getty ImagesWe did it! One whole point.After weeks of mounting pressure, we finally have something to smile about. A very hard-earned point on the road at West Ham and coming from behind to level the record-low tally set by Derby County.It is a point that feels like a win. Unlike the Crystal Palace heartbreak. After recent collapses to Aston Villa and Tottenham Hotspur, we were all starting to wonder whether we would hit that 11-point target. The new challenge is to surpass that. We have to fancy our chances in the final five games remaining.Interim boss Simon Rusk has Saints playing with more confidence and we would certainly have been worth a lead at half-time. But once again, we could not capitalise on our chances and conceded in the opening stages of the second half.We are all hoping this is a sign of things to come. Can we become harder to beat? Just maybe we can play with more freedom now that pressure has released. Hopefully the home form can turn around to give fans a reason to keep bums on seats.Of our 11 points this season, six points have come away from home and a meagre five at St. Mary's Stadium. We need to energy from those travelling supporters.There's no doubt that the point at London Stadium is something to build on and with Fulham at home this weekend, can we see us play like we're not already relegated?Here's hoping we can see St. Mary's stay full until till the final whistle for a change. It should now be a case of how many points we can get to make sure we head into the off-season with as much momentum as possible.Find more from Ray Hunt at the In that Number podcast, external£100m price tag jokes are 'all fun' - Diblingpublished at 12:50 21 April12:50 21 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesSouthampton midfielder Tyler Dibling says his £100m price tag has become a bit of joke and his team-mates have been teasing him about it.The club has reportedly put that hefty price tag on the 19-year-old because he is young and homegrown English talent.Dibling has been linked with Newcastle and Manchester United while a host of Bundesliga clubs have also shown an interest."There's a few nicknames going around," said  Dibling. "It is all jokes. Nobody takes it seriously. It's just a number. It's all fun."'Rambo' [Aaron Ramsdale] loves it to be fair. I'll miss a shot in training and he'll just go '90 million' or '80 million' as it goes down."It's all good fun but I'm just trying to practise every day and to get better. I just go in to train the best I can every day and work hard."At the end of the day, I love Southampton. I have been here since I was eight. It is such a great team and I am working to do big things with them."West Ham 1-1 Southampton - the fans' verdictpublished at 11:38 21 April11:38 21 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesWe asked for your thoughts after Saturday's Premier League game between West Ham and Southampton.Here are some of your comments:West Ham fansIan: Another disappointing performance after a promising display at Anfield last week. There is a complete lack of cohesion especially the midfield three. James Ward-Prowse and Carlos Soler are not good enough and this is where we need to improve next season with younger and hungrier players. I don't blame Graham Potter as these are not his players but these performances have been going on for some time under different managers and a major construction of the team is urgently required in the summer.Chris: Too many inconsistent and underperforming players. Slack defenders, a lack of mobility in midfield, and unfit and misfiring forwards for about two years now. Can't just blame the managers. The recruitment and squad have been equally to blame.Ken: In a poor season for West Ham, this result has got to be the most embarrassing yet. I believe Potter can do a good job next season but has got to get seven or eight players out in the summer break and try to find better replacements. There are too many players who don't have the Hammers pride.Southampton fansColin: A better performance, we never gave up and were unlucky not to win. A crying need for a regular goalscorer. Let's hope we can get a few more points.Stuart: So happy to get a point. Just wish our luck would be that little bit better. So many times we have been in the game, only for luck, and then confidence to desert us.  But we left it all out there and that's all I can ask.  Let's now see if we can get one more win before this season ends.Steve: The best football Southampton have played all season is when Simon Rusk has been in charge. They could do a lot worse than giving him a permanent crack at it in the Championship next year.11:58 20 AprilWest Ham's Fullkrug 'very angry' after draw with Southampton.

Really pleased for the players as well, I think they deserved their moment at the end today."A nice moment of togetherness, which I think will do everyone good. In the end, it was the least we deserved out of the game."We were unlucky not to get in at half-time in front, we had some big moments, big chances and we're disappointed with the goal we conceded."But, especially with where we are at the bottom, already relegated, the second half performance is something we can be delighted about."On coming from a goal down: "That took some mental stamina from the players, they kept that belief and discipline. It was nice for the players to get that moment at the end."On matching Derby's record low points total: "There's a couple of things around that. I'm focussing on the positives, I think the football club needs to focus on the positives."We're not stupid, we know that points are important and the records but it's about not obsessing on that. Concentrate on our performance level and if we do that, I'm sure we'll take care of the points record."West Ham 1-1 Southampton: Did you know?published at 17:15 19 April17:15 19 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesLesley Ugochukwu's late equaliser was his first goal in his 34th Premier League appearance (for Southampton and Chelsea).
