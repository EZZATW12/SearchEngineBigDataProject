We are going to have to raise our game, that is clear."This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, England lift the Women's Six Nations trophy'We are ready for what is to come'Alongside winning a seventh title in a row, Mitchell made clear his priority was to build "two teams" for this year's World Cup.Having used 34 players and trusting the likes of full-back Emma Sing to start a Grand Slam decider to avoid risking Ellie Kildunne's minor hamstring injury, Mitchell achieved his goal of building a wider squad.Continuity in selection will always affect team cohesion, and despite it preventing a full 80-minute performance, Mitchell has built incredible player depth.Competition for places is at an all-time high, proven by both 2014 World Cup-winners Marlie Packer and Emily Scarratt missing out on the matchday squad at Allianz Stadium."You can't play eight matches with the same group in a World Cup," the New Zealander said."We don't have to do that because of the competition we have got."We give them their jobs early. Some girls might only get one game at the World Cup and that is my job. We have matured massively in that area now. We are ready for what is to come."If England and France top their pool and win their quarter-finals they will meet in Bristol for the semi-finals of this year's World Cup.Former England flanker Maggie Alphonsi, who also won the World Cup in 2014, agrees with Mitchell that a tough test against Les Bleues will be a blessing for the Red Roses come the showpiece tournament."The Six Nations needed that jeopardy," Alphonsi told BBC Sport. "It was a proper Test match and England should be proud of the way they dug deep to win."They had to grind it out and you want that test before a World Cup."This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, England survive France comeback to win Grand Slam by a single pointThe Red Roses have been defeated by the Black Ferns in the past two World Cup finals and the draw for this year's tournament means they could again present the final hurdle.Since losing to New Zealand in 2022, Mitchell's side have defeated the world champions three times to increase their tag of favourites for the competition.Canada, who are ranked number two in the world behind England, have also vastly improved and despite defeat gave the Six Nations champions a good test at WXV1 in October.With nations improving, the knack of simply getting over the line when it matters will stand Mitchell's side in good stead."Would England have got away with that playing New Zealand?" former England hooker Brian Moore told BBC Sport."That's the question they have to ask. It is about winning and England got over the line."England captain Zoe Aldcroft had a practice run at lifting a trophy at the venue that hosts the World Cup final. She nearly dropped it, but like her team held on. Should England make the final at Twickenham in September, the skipper and her team will be ready for whatever comes their way.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Oops!
