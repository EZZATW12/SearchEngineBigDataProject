He spoke of how the previous regime was "hounding out" those who disagreed with the way the Church was handling many things, including the sexual abuse of children. "There were a number of priests who were silenced in one way or another, or threatened with excommunication, as I was," he said."It was becoming rather difficult to keep on being the priest who I wanted to be."But "within three months of Francis being Pope, he was saying the same things I was".ReutersThousands came to see the Pope as his body was transferred to St Peter's Basilica on WednesdayIn Belfast, outside Clonard Monastery after a special prayer service, one churchgoer said the Pope's funeral would be "a beautiful day".
