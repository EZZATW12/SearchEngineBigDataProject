Mr Mangione denies that he murdered the father of two.According to a law enforcement, Mr Mangione was allegedly motivated by resentment at what he called "parasitic" health insurance companies.He had spent time in a surfing community in Hawaii, but left owing to debilitating back pain, say those who remember him. It is unclear, however, to what extent his own health troubles shaped his views of the medical industry.Mr Mangione is currently being held without bail at a notorious jail in Brooklyn, also holding rapper Sean "Diddy" Combs. He is facing federal charges, as well as state charges in New York and Pennsylvania. Federal prosecutors are pursuing the death penalty after charging him with multiple crimes, including murder and stalking.US Attorney General Pam Bondi said the death penalty was necessary because he committed a "cold-blooded assassination that shocked America"."After careful consideration, I have directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty in this case as we carry out President Trump's agenda to stop violent crime and Make America Safe Again," she continued.Lawyers for Mr Mangione have called the move a "political stunt"."Luigi is caught in a high stakes game of tug-of-war between state and federal prosecutors, except the trophy is a young man's life," said his lawyers, Karen Agnifilo and Avi Moskowitz.In New York, Mr Mangione has been charged with 11 crimes, including murder and terrorism.He also was charged in Pennsylvania with forgery, carrying firearms without a licence, tampering with records or identification, possessing instruments of crime and providing a false identification to police.He was arrested five days after the attack, at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, and was allegedly in possession of a gun, bullets, multiple fake IDs and cash.Mr Mangione also had a handwritten document that expressed "ill will" towards corporate America and included passages such as "frankly, these parasites had it coming", according to police.Investigators say the words "deny", "defend" and "depose" were written on shell casings found at the scene of Mr Thompson's murder. Law enforcement sources say this may be a reference to the "three Ds of insurance" - tactics used by companies to reject payment claims by patients.Mr Mangione comes from a prominent family in the Baltimore area who are known for businesses including country clubs, nursing homes and a radio station according to local media.

Mr Mangione attended the private, all-boys Gilman School in Baltimore. He was valedictorian, an accolade usually bestowed on the student with the highest academic achievements. Speaking to the BBC's US partner, CBS News, one of his classmates said Mr Mangione "didn't have any enemies" and was a "valedictorian for a reason".PA Department of CorrectionsPolice released this mugshot of Mr Mangione after he was charged with murderMr Mangione went on to graduate from the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned a bachelor's and master's degree in computer science, according to the school, and founded a video game development club. A friend who attended the Ivy League college at the same time as Mr Mangione described him as a "super normal" and "smart person".Mr Mangione was employed as a data engineer for TrueCar, a digital retailing website for new and used cars, according to his social media profiles. A company spokesman told the BBC he had not worked there since 2023. He also spent time in a co-living surfing community in Hawaii called Surfbreak. Sarah Nehemiah, who knew him then, told CBS he left due to his back injury, which had worsened from surfing and hiking.Watch: NY shooting suspect 'is no hero', says Pennsylvania governorFriends have told US media he had surgery on his back. The background image on an X account believed to belong to Mr Mangione shows an x-ray of a spine with hardware in it. On a Reddit account that appears to have belonged to him, Mr Mangione reportedly posted about his struggles with chronic back pain and brain fog. A former roommate, RJ Martin, told the BBC that while Mr Mangione "never complained", his back pain at times "prohibited him" from doing "many normal things", such as surfing or playing volleyball. Mr Martin - who eventually lost contact with Mr Mangione - said that he believed his former friend "would have never conceived of hurting someone else". "There's no making sense of it," he added.

Starting in 1978, Kaczynski carried out a bombing campaign that killed three people and injured dozens of others, until he was arrested in 1996.In his review, Mr Mangione acknowledged Kaczynski was a violent individual, but also described him as a political revolutionary.Mr Mangione's mother reported him missing in November to San Francisco authorities, telling them she had not heard from her son since July. After police began searching for the shooting suspect in Thompson's murder, the missing person report Mr Mangione's mother filed was flagged to authorities, New York Police Department Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny told reporters on Tuesday. Police contacted Mr Mangione's mother, who did not identify her son as the suspect but said "it might be something that she could see him doing".
