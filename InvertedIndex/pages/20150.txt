4-bit computing is the use of computer architectures in which integers and other data units are 4 bits wide. 4-bit central processing unit (CPU) and arithmetic logic unit (ALU) architectures are those that are based on registers or data buses of that size. A group of four bits is also called a nibble and has 24 = 16 possible values, with a range of 0 to 15.
4-bit computation is obsolete, i.e. CPUs supporting 4-bit as the maximum size. However, 4-bit integers (or smaller), and 4-bit floating point is gaining ground for AI, large-language models.[1]
4-bit processors were widely used in electronic calculators and other roles where decimal math was used, like electronic cash registers, microwave oven timers, and so forth. This is because a 4-bit value holds a single binary-coded decimal (BCD) digit, making it a natural size for directly processing decimal values. As a 4-bit value is generally too small to hold a memory address for real-world programs or data, the address bus of these systems was generally larger. For instance, the canonical 4-bit microprocessor, the Intel 4004, had a 12-bit address format.
4-bit designs were used only for a short period when integrated circuits were still expensive, and were found primarily in cost-sensitive roles. While 4-bit computing is mostly obsolete, 4-bit values are still used in the same decimal-centric roles they were developed for, and modern implementations are generally much wider and process multiple 4-bit values in parallel. An example of such a system is the HP Saturn design of the 1980s. By the 1990s, most such uses had been replaced by general purpose binary designs.


History[edit]

A 4-bit processor may seem limited, but it is a good match for calculators, where each decimal digit fits into four bits.[2]
Some of the first microprocessors had a 4-bit word length and were developed around 1970. The first commercial microprocessor was the binary-coded decimal (BCD-based) Intel 4004,[3][4] developed for calculator applications in 1971; it had a 4-bit word length, but had 8-bit instructions and 12-bit addresses. It was succeeded by the Intel 4040, which added interrupt support and a variety of other new features.
The first commercial single-chip computer was the 4-bit Texas Instruments TMS 1000 (1974).[2] It contained a 4-bit CPU with a Harvard architecture and 8-bit-wide instructions, an on-chip instruction ROM, and an on-chip data RAM with 4-bit words.[5]
The Rockwell PPS-4 was another early 4-bit processor, introduced in 1972, which had a long lifetime in handheld games and similar roles. It was steadily improved and by 1975 been combined with several support chips to make a one-chip computer.[6]
The 4-bit processors were programmed in assembly language or Forth, e.g. "MARC4 Family of 4 bit Forth CPU"[7] (which is now discontinued) because of the extreme size constraint on programs and because common programming languages (for microcontrollers, 8-bit and larger), such as the C programming language, do not support 4-bit data types (C, and C++, and more languages require that the size of the char data type be at least 8 bits,[8] and that all data types other than bitfields have a size that is a multiple of the character size[9][10][11]).
The 1970s saw the emergence of 4-bit software applications for mass markets like pocket calculators. During the 1980s, 4-bit microprocessors were used in handheld electronic games to keep costs low.
In the 1970s and 1980s, a number of research and commercial computers used bit slicing, in which the CPU's arithmetic logic unit (ALU) was built from multiple 4-bit-wide sections, each section including a chip such as an Am2901 or 74181.
The Zilog Z80 (discontinued in 2024), although it is an 8-bit microprocessor, has a 4-bit ALU.[12][13]
Although the Data General Nova is a series of 16-bit minicomputers, the original Nova and the Nova 1200 internally processed numbers 4 bits at a time with a 4-bit ALU,[14] sometimes called "nybble-serial".[15]
The HP Saturn processors, used in many Hewlett-Packard calculators between 1984 and 2003  (including the HP 48 series of scientific calculators) are "4-bit" (or hybrid 64-/4-bit) machines; as the Intel 4004 did, they string multiple 4-bit words together, e.g. to form a 20-bit memory address, and most of the registers are 64 bits wide, storing 16 4-bit digits.[16][17][18]
In addition, some early calculators –  such as the 1967 Casio AL-1000, the 1972 Sinclair Executive, and the aforementioned 1984 HP Saturn –  had 4-bit datapaths that accessed their registers 4 bits (one BCD digit) at a time.[19]

Uses[edit]

One bicycle computer specifies that it uses a "4 bit, 1-chip microcomputer".[20] Other typical uses include coffee makers, infrared remote controls,[21] and security alarms.[22]
The processor in Barbie typewriters that can encrypt is a 4-bit microcontroller.[23]
Several manufacturers used 4-bit microcontrollers in their early electronic games:[24]

Mattel's Funtronics Jacks, Red Light Green Light, Tag, Plus One and Dalla$.
Milton Bradley Lightfight and Electronic Battleship 1982.
Coleco Head to Head Basketball.
National Semiconductor Quiz Kid Racer.
Entex Space Invader.
Texas Instruments My Little Computer.[25]
Western Digital used a 4-bit microcontroller as the basis for their WD2412 time-of-day clock.[26]
The Grundy Newbrain computer uses a 4-bit microcontroller to manage its keyboard, tape I/O, and its built-in 16 character VF alphanumeric display.[27]

Details[edit]
Main article: Nibble
With 4 bits, it is possible to create 16 different values. All single-digit hexadecimal numbers can be written with four bits.
Binary-coded decimal is a digital encoding method for numbers using decimal notation, with each decimal digit represented by four bits.
