International Federation for the Promotion of Mechanism and Machine Science (IFToMM) is an organization that supports international exchange of researchers and engineers from the wide range of discipline related to Mechanical Engineering.


Mission[edit]
To promote research and development in the field of Machines and Mechanisms by theoretical and experimental methods, along with their practical application.

History[edit]
It was on September 29, 1969m at the Second World Congress on Theory of Mechanisms and Machines which took place in Zakopane (Poland), that two scientists, Ivan Artobolevski (USSR) and Erskine Crossley (USA), proposed to establish an International Federation of scientists and engineers to facilitate worldwide collaboration.[1]
[2] Representatives of 13 countries signed the foundation act and the International Federation for the Theory of Machines (IFToMM) came into existence.[3] The initial Member Organizations were represented by: 

Academician Ivan I. Artobolevski (USSR),
Prof. Erskine F.R. Crossley (USA),
Prof. Michael S. Konstantinov (Bulgaria),
Dr. Werner Thomas (GFR),
Prof. B.M. Belgaumkar (India),
Prof. Kenneth H. Hunt (Australia),
Prof. J. Oderfeld (Poland),
Prof. Jack Phillips (Australia),
Prof. George Rusanov (Bulgaria),
Prof. Wolfgang Rössner (GDR),
Prof. Zènò Terplàn (Hungary),
Prof. Jammi S. Rao (India),
Prof. Giovanni Bianchi (Italy),
Prof. Adam Morecki (Poland),
Nicolae I. Manolescu (Romania),
Leonard Maunder (UK),
Douglas Muster (USA),
Ilic Branisky (Yugoslavia).
Given the expansion of the topics within the IFToMM umbrella,[4]
[5]
[6]
[7] in 1999, the Executive Council decided to recognize the changing role of the organization in international collaboration and approved a new name: "The International Federation for the Promotion of Mechanism and Machine Science". However, the Executive Council considered that the abbreviation IFToMM was already widely used, and therefore suggested to keep it (along with the logo) as a short version of the organization's name.
[8]

Officers, Presidents, and General Secretaries[edit]
IFToMM officers are the Chairs of IFToMM Member Organizations, the Chairs of Permanent Commissions and Technical Committees, as well as the members of the Executive Council. A complete historical list of IFToMM officers was published in the Proceedings of the Second International Symposium on History of Machines and Mechanisms HMM2004.[9]
The Presidents were:

Ivan I. Artobolevskii (USSR),
Leonard Maunder (United Kingdom),
Bernard Roth (USA),
Giovanni Bianchi (Italy),
Adam Morecki (Poland),
Jorge Angeles (Canada),
Kenneth J. Waldron (USA),
Marco Ceccarelli (Italy),
Yoshihiko Nakamura (Japan),
Marco Ceccarelli (Italy) (repeated),  and
Andrés Kecskeméthy (Germany).
The Secretaries General were:

M.S. Konstantinov (Bulgaria),
Emil Stanchev (Bulgaria),
Adam Morecki (Poland),
Elizabeth Filemon (Hungary),
Ladislav Půst (Czechoslovakia),
Tatu Leinonen (Finland),
Marco Ceccarelli (Italy),
Teresa Zielinska (Poland) (two terms), and
Erwin Christian Lovasz (Romania).
Meetings[edit]
IFToMM General Assembly: every 4 years
Executive Council Meeting: an annual meeting of the members of Executive Council
IFToMM World Congress: every four years

Members[edit]
Membership in IFToMM is not individual. Instead, it is by Member Organization (MO) which are akin to national or territorial organizations.  A full list of Member Organizations available on the IFToMM web site.  Each MO has its own individual or group membership rules.
As of the 2015 General Assembly held in Taipei (Taiwan), IFToMM had 47 MOs.  In 2018, the membership went down to 45 MOs.
