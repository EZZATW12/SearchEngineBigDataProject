David Tse (Chinese: 謝雅正; pinyin: Xiè Yǎzhèng) is the Thomas Kailath and Guanghan Xu Professor of Engineering at Stanford University.[1]


Education[edit]
Tse earned a B.S. in systems design engineering from University of Waterloo in 1989, an M.S. in electrical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1991, and a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from MIT in 1994.[2] As a postdoctoral student he was a staff member at AT&T Bell Laboratories.[2]

Career[edit]
Tse's research at Stanford focuses on information theory and its applications in fields such as wireless communication, machine learning, energy and computational biology.[3][4] He has designed assembly software to handle DNA and RNA sequencing data and was an inventor of the proportional-fair scheduling algorithm for cellular wireless systems.[4] He received the 2017 Claude E. Shannon Award.[3] In 2018, he was elected to the National Academy of Engineering.[4]
