This category contains articles with Chinese-language text. The primary purpose of these categories is to facilitate manual or automated checking of text in other languages.
This category should only be added with the {{Lang}} family of templates, never explicitly.

For example {{Lang|zh|楷書}}, which wraps the text with <span lang="zh">. Also available is {{Langx|zh|楷書}} which displays as Chinese: 楷書.
