Marvell Technology Group's SheevaPlug plug computer in action
Seagate Dockstar, a plug computer similar to the SheevaPlug
A plug computer is a small-form-factor computer whose chassis contains the AC power plug, and thus plugs directly into the wall. Alternatively, the computer may resemble an AC adapter or a similarly small device. Plug computers are often configured for use in the home or office as compact computer.


Description[edit]
Plug computers consist of a high-performance, low-power system-on-a-chip processor, with several I/O hardware ports (USB ports, Ethernet connectors, etc.). Most versions do not have provisions for connecting a display and are best suited to running media servers, back-up services, or file sharing and remote access functions; thus acting as a bridge between in-home protocols (such as Digital Living Network Alliance (DLNA) and Server Message Block (SMB)) and cloud-based services. There are, however, plug computer offerings that have analog VGA monitor and/or HDMI connectors, which, along with multiple USB ports, permit the use of a display, keyboard, and mouse, thus making them full-fledged, low-power alternatives to desktop and laptop computers. They typically run any of a number of Linux distributions.
Plug computers typically consume little power and are inexpensive.

History[edit]
A number of other devices of this type began to appear at the 2009 Consumer Electronics Show.

On January 6, 2009 CTERA Networks launched a device called CloudPlug that provides online backup at local disk speeds and overlays a file sharing service.[1] The device also transforms any external USB hard drive into a network-attached storage device.[2][3]
On January 7, 2009,  Cloud Engines unveiled the Pogoplug network access server.[4][5][6][7]
On January 8, 2009, Axentra announced availability of their HipServ platform.[8]
On February 23, 2009, Marvell Technology Group announced its plans to build a mini-industry around plug computers.[9][10]
On August 19, 2009, CodeLathe announced availability of their TonidoPlug network access server.[11]
On November 13, 2009 QuadAxis launched its plug computing device product line and development platform, featuring the QuadPlug and QuadPC and running QuadMix, a modified Linux.[12]
On January 5, 2010, Iomega announced their iConnect network access server.[13]
On January 7, 2010 Pbxnsip launched its plug computing device the sipJack running pbxnsip: an IP Communications platform.[14]
