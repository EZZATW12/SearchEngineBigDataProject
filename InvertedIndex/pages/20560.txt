Clifford Edward Berry (April 19, 1918 – October 30, 1963) helped John Vincent Atanasoff create the first digital electronic computer in 1939, the Atanasoff–Berry computer (ABC).

Biography[edit]
Clifford Berry was born April 19, 1918, in Gladbrook, Iowa, to Fred and Grace Berry.[1] His father owned an appliance repair shop, where he was able to learn about radios.[1] He graduated from Marengo High School in Marengo, Iowa, in 1934 as the class valedictorian at age 16.[2] He went on to study at Iowa State College (now known as Iowa State University), eventually earning a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering in 1939 and followed by his master's degree in physics in 1941.[2]
In 1942, he married an ISU classmate and Atanasoff's secretary, Martha Jean Reed.[1]
By 1948, he earned his PhD in physics from Iowa State University.[2]
He died in 1963, attributed to "possible suicide".[3]
