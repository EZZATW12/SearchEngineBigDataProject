This is a maintenance category, used for maintenance of the Wikipedia project. It is not part of the encyclopedia and contains non-article pages, or groups articles by status rather than subject. Do not include this category in content categories.
This is a tracking category. It builds and maintains a list of pages primarily for the sake of the list itself. They are not part of the encyclopedia's categorization scheme.

This category is hidden on its member pages—unless the corresponding user preference (Appearance → Show hidden categories) is set.
These categories can be used to track, build and organize lists of pages needing "attention en masse" (for example, pages using deprecated syntax), or that may need to be edited at someone's earliest convenience.
These categories also serve to aggregate members of several lists or sub-categories into a larger, more efficient list (discriminated by classifications).
This category combines all articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from February 2023 (2023-02) to enable us to work through the backlog more systematically. It is a member of Category:Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases.


Articles are automatically put into this monthly category by inline templates such as {{weasel inline}}, {{by whom}}, {{who}}, and {{which}}, which mark specific words as "weasel words". (Do not add this category directly.)
The key to improving weasel words in articles is either a) to name a source for the opinion or b) to change opinionated language to concrete facts. After you have made any necessary edits, remove the template.
