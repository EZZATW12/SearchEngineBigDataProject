American chemistry organization
The Electrochemical SocietyFormation1902; 123 years ago (1902)TypeScientific societyLegal status501(c)(3) nonprofit organizationHeadquartersPennington, New JerseyLocationUnited StatesMembership8,000Key peopleChristopher J. Jannuzzi (Executive Director)Stefan De Gendt (President)Websiteelectrochem.org
The Electrochemical Society is a learned society (professional association) based in the United States that supports scientific inquiry in the field of electrochemistry solid-state science and related technology. The Society membership comprises more than 8,000 scientists and engineers in over 85 countries at all degree levels and in all fields of electrochemistry, solid-state science and related technologies.[1] Additional support is provided by institutional members including corporations and laboratories. 
ECS is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. 
The Society publishes numerous journals including the Journal of The Electrochemical Society (the oldest peer-reviewed journal in its field), the Journal of Solid State Science and Technology, ECS Meeting Abstracts, ECS Transactions, and ECS Interface. The Society sponsors the ECS Monographs Series. These distinguished monographs, published by John Wiley & Sons, are the leading textbooks in their fields.  
The ECS Digital Library on IOPscience encompasses over 160,000 journal and magazine articles and meeting abstracts.[2] The Society supports open access through the Society’s initiative to make research freely available to world readers and free for authors to publish.  
The Society has thirteen topic interest area divisions as well as regional sections in Asia, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, North America, and Southern Asia; over 100 ECS student chapters are located in major universities in all of these regions as well as Eastern Europe and South Africa.[3] Student members benefit from exposure to experts in their fields, sharing research, volunteer activities, and career development. 
ECS administers numerous international awards and supports STEM educational and outreach efforts.   


History[edit]
The Electrochemical Society was founded in 1902 in Philadelphia, PA.[4] At the beginning, ECS was called the American Electrochemical Society.
The 19th century saw many applications of electricity to chemical processes and chemical understanding. Bridging the gap between electrical engineering and chemistry led people in industrial and academic circles to search for a new forum to discuss developments in the burgeoning field of electrochemistry.
The original constitution of the Society called for holding meetings and publishing papers presented there and the ensuing discussions. In 1902 the Society ushered in a new publication, Transactions of the American Electrochemical Society. In 1907 the first “local” section was formed at the University of Wisconsin. That same year, the American Electrochemical Society Bulletin was launched; it became the Journal of The Electrochemical Society in 1948. 
In the 1920s, topical interest area divisions began to be founded, including the High Temperature Materials Division and the Electrodeposition Division. In 1930, the international nature of the Society was officially recognized by dropping “American” from the name. A new category of membership was started in 1941 to permit industrial companies to support the Society’s mission. ECS began fulfilling the need for critical textbooks with the publication of its second monograph, the Corrosion Handbook, by H. H. Uhlig in 1948. 
Throughout the latter half of the 20th century, the Society continued to grow in size and importance, expanding the number of its publications, and the significance of the technical research unveiled at its meetings. 
Over time, the Society’s members and publications’ authors have included many distinguished scientists and engineers. The Society’s original charter members included:

E. G. Acheson, who commercialized carborundum, an artificial graphite;
H. H. Dow, the founder of Dow Chemical Company;
C. M. Hall, the inventor of the Hall process for the manufacture of aluminum;
Edward Weston, the founder of Weston Instruments.
Thomas A. Edison joined the Society in 1903 and enjoyed membership for 28 years. In 1965, Gordon Moore's seminal prediction, Moore's Law, developed its roots within the Society. ECS has included numerous Nobel laureates among its members, most recently the three co-winners of the 2019 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. John B. Goodenough, M. Stanley Whittingham, and Akira Yoshino shared the prize “for the development of lithium-ion batteries.”[5]

Meetings[edit]
The Society has hosted scientific technical meetings since 1902 including its biannual meetings in the spring and fall of each year.

Publications[edit]
ECS publishes peer-reviewed technical journals, proceedings, monographs, conference abstracts, and a quarterly news magazine.

Journals[edit]
Since 1902, the Society has published journals now available through ECS’s publishing partner.[6]

Journal History[edit]
Several ECS journals which have ceased publication are now preserved as an archive. These archived publications are available through the Digital Library. 

ECS Books & Monographs[edit]

Educational activities and programs[edit]
Awards[edit]
The society recognizes members for outstanding technical achievement in electrochemical and solid-state science and technology at various career levels, and recognizes exceptional service to the Society, through the ECS Honors & Awards Program[7]—the international awards, medals, and prizes administered by the Society. 
Starting in 1919, Honorary Membership was bestowed for outstanding contributions to the Society. ECS's most prestigious award, the Edward Goodrich Acheson Award, established in 1928, is presented in even-numbered years for "conspicuous contribution to the advancement of the objectives, purposes, and activities of the society".[8]
Supporting students and early career scientists has been a long-held goal of The Electrochemical Society. The Norman Hackerman Young Author Award[9] —established in 1928—is one of the first awards created by the Society. It is given for the best paper published in the Journal of The Electrochemical Society that year by a young author or co-authors. Recipients must be under 31 years of age. Among the significant talents recognized at an early age by this award is Nobel laureate, M. Stanley Whittingham, who received it in 1970.
The Olin Palladium Award (formerly the Palladium Medal Award), established in 1950, is presented in odd-numbered years to recognize "distinguished contributions to the field of electrochemical or corrosion science."[10]
ECS honors members with the designation, Fellow of The Electrochemical Society[11] for having made significant accomplishments to the fields of electrochemistry and solid state science and technology, and to the Society.
The Vittorio de Nora Award was established in 1971 to recognize distinguished contributions to the field of electrochemical engineering and technology.[12]

Fellowships and grants[edit]
Through competitive fellowship stipends, ECS supports students and young professionals as they pursue new ideas and forge connections with professionals both within and outside the field.
