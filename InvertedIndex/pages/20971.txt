Display device for presentation of images, video, or text transmitted electronically
An electronic visual display is a display device that can display images, video, or text that is transmitted electronically. Electronic visual displays include television sets, computer monitors, and digital signage. They are ubiquitous in mobile computing applications like tablet computers, smartphones, and information appliances. Many electronic visual displays are informally referred to as touch screens.
Starting in the early 2000s, flat-panel displays began to dominate the industry, as cathode-ray tubes (CRT) were phased out, especially for computer applications. Starting in the mid 2010s, curved display panels began to be used in televisions, computer monitors, and smartphones.


Types[edit]
There are various technologies used for electronic visual displays:

Liquid crystal display (LCD) with light-emitting diode (LED)-backlit Liquid crystal display (LCD)
Light-emitting diode (LED) display
OLED display
AMOLED display
Plasma (P) display
Quantum dot (QD) display
Electroluminescent (EL) display
An overhead projector can be considered a type of electronic visual display.
Additionally, CRTs were widely used in the past and microLED displays are under development.

Classification[edit]
Electronic visual displays present visual information according to the electrical input signal (analog or digital) either by emitting light (then they are called active displays) or, alternatively, by modulating available light during the process of reflection or transmission (light modulators are called passive displays).

Display mode of observation[edit]
Electronic visual displays can be observed directly (direct view display) or the displayed information can be projected to a screen (transmissive or reflective screen). This usually happens with smaller displays at a certain magnification.



Display modes of observation


Direct view display

Projection display


transmissive mode of operation

front-projection (with reflective screen)e.g. video projector


reflective mode of operation

rear-projection (with transmissive screen)e.g. rear projection television screen


transflective mode of operation(e.g. transflective LCD)

retinal projection (with or without combiner)e.g. head mounted display


A different kind of projection display is the class of "laser projection displays", where the image is built up sequentially either via line by line scanning or by writing one complete column at a time. For that purpose one beam is formed from three lasers operating at the primary colors, and this beam is scanned electro-mechanically (galvanometer scanner, micro-mirror array)) or electro-acousto-optically.

Layout of picture elements[edit]
Depending on the shape and on the arrangement of the picture elements of a display, either fixed information can be displayed (symbols, signs), simple numerals (7-segment layout) or arbitrary shapes can be formed (dot-matrix displays).



Layout of picture elements


Segmented displayscharacters, numbers and symbols of fixed shape (may be multiplex addressed)The following layouts are well known: Seven-segment displayFourteen-segment display Sixteen-segment display

Dot-matrix displayssub-pixels are arranged in a regular 2-dimensional array(multiplex addressing required); arbitrary shapes can be formed and displayed


Emission and control of colors[edit]
Colors can be generated by selective emission, by selective absorption, transmission or by selective reflection.



Color emission and control


additive mixingprimary colors add up to produce white light

subtractive mixingfilters, dyes, pigments (e.g.printing) subtract (absorb) parts of white light


temporal mixing (additive)e.g. rotating primary color filter wheel in projectors

spatial mixing (additive)closely spaced sub-pixels


spatio temporal color mixingcombined spatial and temporal mixing[1]





arrangement of sub-pixelsfor additive color mixingsee sub-pixel arrangements 1see sub-pixel arrangements 2see sub-pixel arrangements 3

subtractive color mixing does not require special sub-pixel arrangementsall components (e.g. filters) have to be in the same path of light.


Examples:stripedelta-nablaPenTile arrangement, e.g. RGB+White




Addressing modes[edit]
Each sub-pixel of a display device must be selected (addressed) in order to be energized in a controlled way.



Addressing modes (selection of picture elements)


direct addressingeach individual picture element has electrical connections to the driving electronics.

multiplexed addressingseveral picture elements have common electrical connections to the driving electronics,e. g.. row and column electrodes when the picture elements are arranged in a two dimensional matrix.










active matrix addressingactive electronic elements added in order to improve selection of picture elements.
thin-film diodes (TFDs)
thin-film transistors (TFTs)
amorphous silicon (a-Si)
polycrystalline silicon (p-Si)
monocrystalline silicon

passive matrix addressingthe nonlinearity of the display effect (e.g. LCD, LED)is used to realize the addressing of individual pixels in multiplex addressing. In this mode only a quite limited number of lines can be addressed. In the case of (STN-)LCDs this maximum is at ~240, but at the expense of a considerable reduction of contrast.


The matrix of active electronic elements can be used in transmissive mode of operation (high transmittance required) or a non-transparent active matrix can be used for reflective LCDs (e.g. liquid crystal on silicon (LCOS)).|


Display driving modes[edit]


Driving modes (activation of picture elements)


voltage drivingactivation of pixels by voltage (e.g. LCD field effects). If the current is low enough this mode may be the basis for displays with very low power requirements (e.g. μW for LCDs without backlight).

current drivingactivation of pixels by electric current (e.g. LED).
