From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia




This is a maintenance category, used for maintenance of the Wikipedia project. It is not part of the encyclopedia and contains non-article pages, or groups articles by status rather than subject. Do not include this category in content categories.
This is a hidden category. It is not shown on its member pages, unless the corresponding user preference (Appearance → Show hidden categories) is set.
This category is for articles which include reference implementations of algorithms, or compilable examples of programming constructs, either in real-world programming languages or in pseudocode.
Note to editors: Please do not add any more subcategories to this page without carefully considering whether the articles in the new category might more productively be rewritten to use one of the currently existing languages.
Do not add subcategories whose only members are articles about the language itself; for example, adding a category Category:Articles with example APL code whose only member is APL (programming language).
