From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


This category has a backlog that requires the attention of willing editors.This notice will hide itself when this category has fewer than 100 items. (recount)
This is a maintenance category, used for maintenance of the Wikipedia project. It is not part of the encyclopedia and contains non-article pages, or groups articles by status rather than subject. Do not include this category in content categories.
This is a hidden category. It is not shown on its member pages, unless the corresponding user preference (Appearance → Show hidden categories) is set.
This category contains all pages labeled with inline weasel word-related templates such as {{WW}}, {{Weasel-inline}}, {{Who}}, or {{Which}}. It exists primarily for bot-based monitoring of articles containing weasel words. By-month categories are located in Category:Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases.
The key to improving weasel words in articles is to either: a) name a source for the opinion; or b) change any opinionated language to concrete facts. After making such changes, remove the template from the article.
