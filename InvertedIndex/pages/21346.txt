HTML Attributes

❮ Previous
Next ❯


HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.


HTML Attributes

All HTML elements can have attributes
Attributes provide additional information about elements
Attributes are always specified in the start tag
Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"




The href Attribute
The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The 
href attribute specifies the URL of the page 
the link goes to:

Example

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools</a>

Try it Yourself »

You will learn more about links in our HTML Links
chapter.



The src Attribute
The <img> tag is used to embed an 
image in an HTML page. The src attribute 
specifies the path to the image to be displayed:

Example

<img src="img_girl.jpg">

Try it Yourself »

There are two ways to specify the URL in the src 
attribute:
1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted 
on another website. Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".
Notes: External images might be under copyright. If you do 
not get permission to use it, you may be in violation of copyright laws. In 
addition, you cannot control external images; it can suddenly be removed or 
changed.
2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within 
the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. If the URL begins 
without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg". 
If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".
Tip: It is almost always best to use relative URLs. They 
will not break if you change domain.



The width and height Attributes
The <img> tag should also contain the
width and 
height attributes, which specify the width and 
height of the image (in pixels):

Example

<img src="img_girl.jpg" width="500" height="600">

The alt Attribute
The required alt attribute for the <img> 
tag specifies an 
alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. 
This can be due to 
a slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen 
reader.

Example

 <img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl 
  with a jacket">

Try it Yourself »


Example
See what happens if we try to display an image that does not exist:

 <img src="img_typo.jpg" alt="Girl 
  with a jacket">

Try it Yourself »


You will learn more about images in our HTML Images chapter.







The style Attribute
The style attribute is used to add styles to 
an element, such as color, font, size, and more.

Example

<p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>
  
Try it Yourself »

You will learn more about styles in our HTML Styles chapter.



The lang Attribute
You should always include the lang attribute 
inside the <html> tag, to declare the 
language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.
The following example specifies English as the language:


<!DOCTYPE html><html lang="en"><body>...</body></html>


Country codes can also be added to the language code in the lang 
attribute. So, the first two characters define the language of the HTML page, 
and the last two characters define the country.
The following example specifies English as the language and United States as 
the country:


<!DOCTYPE html><html lang="en-US"><body>...</body></html>


You can see all the language codes in our
HTML Language Code Reference.



The title Attribute
The title attribute defines some extra 
information about an 
element.
The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when 
you mouse over the element:

Example

 <p title="I'm a tooltip">This is a paragraph.</p>

We Suggest: Always Use Lowercase Attributes
The HTML standard does not require lowercase attribute names.
The title attribute (and all other attributes) can be written with uppercase or lowercase 
like title or TITLE.
However, W3C recommends lowercase attributes in HTML, and demands 
lowercase attributes for stricter document types like XHTML.

At W3Schools we always use lowercase attribute names.


We Suggest: Always Quote Attribute Values
The HTML standard does not require quotes around attribute values.
However, W3C recommends quotes in HTML, and demands quotes for 
stricter document types like XHTML.

Good:

  <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">Visit our HTML tutorial</a>

Bad:

  <a href=https://www.w3schools.com/html/>Visit our HTML tutorial</a>
Sometimes you have to use quotes. This example will not display 
the title attribute correctly, because it contains a space:

Example

 <p
 title=Description of W3Schools>

 At W3Schools we always use quotes around attribute values.



Single or Double Quotes?
Double quotes around attribute values are the most common in HTML, but single 
quotes can also be used.
In some situations, when the attribute value itself contains double quotes, it is necessary to use single quotes:


<p title='John "ShotGun" Nelson'>


Or vice versa:


<p title="John 'ShotGun' Nelson">
