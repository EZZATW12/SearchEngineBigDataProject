HTML Semantic Elements

❮ Previous
Next ❯


Semantic elements = elements with a meaning.


What are Semantic Elements?
A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.
Examples of semantic elements: <img>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.



Semantic Elements in HTML
Many web sites contain HTML code like:
<div id="nav"> <div class="header"> <div id="footer">
to indicate navigation, header, and footer.
In HTML there are several semantic elements that can be used to define different parts of a web page:
 


<article>
<aside>
<details>
<figcaption>
<figure>
<footer>
<header>
<main>
<mark>
<nav>
<section>
<summary>
<time>








HTML <section> Element
The <section> element defines a section in a document.
According to W3C's HTML documentation: "A section is a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading."
Examples of where a <section> element can be used:

Chapters
Introduction
News items
Contact information

A web page could normally be split into sections for introduction, 
content, and contact information.

Example
Two sections in a document:

    <section><h1>WWF</h1><p>The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) is an 
    international organization working on issues regarding the conservation, 
    research and restoration of the environment, formerly named the World 
    Wildlife Fund. WWF was founded in 1961.</p></section><section>
    <h1>WWF's Panda symbol</h1><p>The Panda has become the symbol of WWF. 
    The well-known panda logo of WWF originated from a panda named Chi Chi that 
    was transferred from the Beijing Zoo to the London Zoo in the same year of 
    the establishment of WWF.</p></section>

HTML <article> Element
The <article> element specifies independent, self-contained content.
An article should make sense on its own, and it should be possible to 
distribute it independently from the rest of the web site.
Examples of where the <article> element can be used:

Forum posts
Blog posts
User comments
Product cards
Newspaper articles


Example
Three articles with independent, self-contained content:

    <article><h2>Google Chrome</h2><p>Google Chrome is a web browser 
    developed by Google, released in 2008. Chrome is the world's most popular 
    web browser today!</p></article><article><h2>Mozilla 
    Firefox</h2><p>Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser developed 
    by Mozilla. Firefox has been the second most popular web browser since 
    January, 2018.</p></article><article><h2>Microsoft Edge</h2>
    <p>Microsoft Edge is a web browser developed by Microsoft, released in 2015. 
    Microsoft Edge replaced Internet Explorer.</p></article>

Example 2
Use CSS to style the <article> element:

  <html><head><style>.all-browsers {  margin: 0;  
  padding: 5px;  background-color: lightgray;}.all-browsers 
  > h1, .browser {  margin: 10px;  padding: 5px;}
  .browser {  background: white;}.browser > h2,  
  p {  margin: 4px;  font-size: 90%;}</style>
  </head><body><article class="all-browsers">  <h1>Most 
  Popular Browsers</h1>  <article class="browser">    
  <h2>Google Chrome</h2>    <p>Google Chrome is a web browser 
  developed by Google, released in 2008. Chrome is the world's most popular web

Nesting <article> in <section> or Vice Versa?
The <article> 
element specifies independent, self-contained content.
The <section> element defines section in a document.
Can we use the definitions to decide how to nest those elements? No, we cannot!
So, you will find HTML pages with <section> elements 
containing <article> elements, and <article> elements containing <section> elements.



HTML <header> Element
The <header> element represents a container for introductory content or 
a set of navigational links.
A <header> element typically contains:

one or more heading elements (<h1> - <h6>)
logo or icon
authorship information

Note: You can have several <header> elements in one 
HTML document. However, <header> cannot be placed within a <footer>, <address> or another <header> element.

Example
A header for an <article>: 

      
    <article>
  <header>
    
 <h1>What Does WWF Do?</h1>
    <p>WWF's mission:</p>
  </header>
   <p>WWF's mission is to stop the degradation of our planet's natural environment,  and build a future in which humans live in harmony with nature.</p>
 </article>

HTML <footer> Element
The <footer> element defines a footer for a document or section.
A <footer> element typically contains:

authorship information
copyright 
information
contact information
sitemap
back to top links
related documents

You can have several <footer> elements in one document.

Example
A footer section in a document:

      
    <footer>
  <p>Author: Hege Refsnes</p>
  <p><a href="mailto:hege@example.com">hege@example.com</a></p>

HTML <nav> Element
The <nav> element defines a set of navigation links.

Notice that NOT all links of a document should be inside a <nav> element. The 
<nav> element is intended only for major blocks of navigation links. 
Browsers, such as screen readers for disabled users, can use this element 
  to determine whether to omit the initial rendering of this content.


Example
A set of navigation links:

    <nav>
  
 <a href="/html/">HTML</a> |
  
 <a href="/css/">CSS</a> |
  
 <a href="/js/">JavaScript</a> |
  
 <a href="/jquery/">jQuery</a>
 </nav>

HTML <aside> Element
The <aside> element defines some content aside from the content it is 
placed in (like a sidebar).
The <aside> content should be 
indirectly related to the surrounding content.

Example
Display some content aside from the content it is placed in:

    <p>My family and I visited The Epcot center this summer. The weather was 
    nice, and Epcot was amazing! I had a great summer together with my 
    family!</p><aside><h4>Epcot Center</h4><p>Epcot is a theme 
    park at Walt Disney World Resort featuring exciting attractions, 
    international pavilions, award-winning fireworks and seasonal special 
    events.</p></aside>
