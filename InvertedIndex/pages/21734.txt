HTML Canvas Reference

❮ Previous
Next ❯



The <canvas> element defines a bitmapped area in an HTML page.
The Canvas API allows JavaScript to draw graphics on the canvas.
The Canvas API can draw shapes, lines, curves, boxes, text, and images, with colors,
rotations, transparencies, and other pixel manipulations.

You can add a canvas element anywhere in an HTML page with the 
<canvas> tag:

Example

  <canvas id="myCanvas" width="300" height="150"></canvas>


  Try it Yourself »

You can access a <canvas> element with the HTML 
DOM method getElementById().
To draw in the canvas you need to create a 2D context object:


const myCanvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
const ctx = myCanvas.getContext("2d");



Note
The HTML <canvas> element itself has no drawing abilities.
You must use JavaScript to draw any graphics.
The getContext() method returns an object 
with tools (methods) for drawing.


Drawing on the Canvas
After you have created a 2D context, you can draw on the canvas.
The fillRect() method draws a black rectangle with a top-left corner at position 20,20.
The rectangle is 150 pixel wide and 100 pixels high.

Example

const myCanvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
const ctx = myCanvas.getContext("2d");

ctx.fillRect(20, 20, 150, 100);


Try it Yourself »


Using Colors
The fillStyle property sets the fill color of the drawing object:

Example

  const myCanvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
  const ctx = myCanvas.getContext("2d");

  ctx.fillStyle = "red";
  ctx.fillRect(20, 20, 150, 100);


  Try it Yourself »

You can also create a new <canvas> element 
with the document.createElement() method,
and add the element to an existing HTML page:

Example

  const myCanvas = document.createElement("canvas");
  document.body.appendChild(myCanvas);
  const ctx = myCanvas.getContext("2d");

  ctx.fillStyle = "red";
  ctx.fillRect(20, 20, 150, 100);


  Try it Yourself »


Paths
The common way to draw on the canvas is to:

Begin a Path - beginPath()
Move to a Point - moveTo()
Draw in the Path - lineTo()
Draw the Path - stroke()



Example

const canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");

ctx.beginPath();
ctx.moveTo(20, 20);
ctx.lineTo(20, 100);
ctx.lineTo(70, 100);
ctx.stroke();

Try it Yourself »
