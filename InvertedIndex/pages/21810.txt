The translate() function moves an element from its current position (according 
to the parameters given for the X-axis and the Y-axis).
The following example moves the <div> element 50 pixels to the right,

The following example rotates the <div> element clockwise with 20 degrees:

Example

div
{

Using negative values will rotate the element counter-clockwise.
The following example rotates the <div> element counter-clockwise with 20 degrees:

Example

{
   
transform: rotate(-20deg);
}

{
   
transform: scaleX(0.5);
}

The scaleY() Function
The scaleY() function increases or decreases the 
height of an element.
The following example increases the <div> element to be three times of its original 
height: 

Example

div
{
   
transform: scaleY(3);
}

The following example decreases the <div> element to be half of its original 
height: 

Example

div
{
   
transform: scaleY(0.5);
}

The skewX() Function

The skewX() function skews an element along the X-axis by the given angle.
The following example skews the <div> element 20 degrees along the 
X-axis:

Example

div
{
   
transform: skewX(20deg);
}

Try it Yourself »


The skewY() Function

The skewY() function skews an element along the Y-axis by the given angle.
The following example skews the <div> element 20 degrees along the Y-axis:

Example

div
{
   
transform: skewY(20deg);
}

Try it Yourself »


The skew() Function

The skew() function skews an element along the X and Y-axis by the given angles.
The following example skews the <div> element 20 degrees along the X-axis, and 10 degrees along the Y-axis:

Example

div
{
   
transform: skew(20deg, 10deg);
}

Try it Yourself »

If the second parameter is not specified, it has a zero value. So, the following example skews the <div> element 20 degrees along the X-axis:

Example

div
{
   
transform: skew(20deg);
}

The matrix() Function

The matrix() function combines all the 2D transform 
functions into one.
The matrix() function take six parameters, containing mathematic functions, 
which allows you to rotate, scale, move (translate), and skew elements.
The parameters are as follow: matrix(scaleX(), skewY(), skewX(), scaleY(), translateX(), translateY())

Example

div
{
    
transform: matrix(1, -0.3, 0, 1, 0, 0);}
