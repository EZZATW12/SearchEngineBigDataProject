CSS Image Filter Effects

❮ Previous
Next ❯


The CSS filter property is used to add visual effects to elements.



CSS Filters
The CSS filter property is used to add visual effects (like blur and saturation) to elements.
Within the filter property, you can use the following CSS functions:

blur()
brightness()
contrast()
drop-shadow()
grayscale()
hue-rotate()
invert()
opacity()
saturate()
sepia()


The CSS blur() Function
The blur() filter function applies a blur effect to an element. A larger value will create more blur.

Example
Apply different blur effects to <img> elements:

  #img1 {  filter: 
  blur(2px);}#img2 {  filter: blur(6px);}

The CSS brightness() Function
The brightness() filter function adjusts the 
brightness of an element.

Values over 100% will provide brighter results
Values under 100% will provide darker results
0% will make the image completely black
100% is default, and represents the original image


Example
Make an image brighter and darker than the original:

  #img1 {  filter: brightness(150%);}#img2 {  
  filter: brightness(50%);}   

Try it Yourself »



The CSS contrast() Function
The contrast() filter function adjusts the 
contrast of an element.

Values over 100% increases the contrast
Values under 100% decreases the contrast
0% will make the image completely gray
100% is default, and represents the original image


Example
Increase and decrease the contrast for an image:

  #img1 {  filter: contrast(150%);}#img2 {  filter: 
  contrast(50%);}   

Try it Yourself »



The CSS drop-shadow() Function
The drop-shadow() filter function applies 
a drop-shadow effect to an image.

Example
Add different drop-shadow effects to an image:

  #img1 {  filter: drop-shadow(8px 8px 10px gray);}#img2 {  
  filter: drop-shadow(10px 10px 7px lightblue);}
Try it Yourself »



The CSS grayscale() Function
The grayscale() filter function converts 
an image to grayscale.

100% (or 1) will make the image completely grayscale
0% (or 0) will have no effect


Example
Set various grayscale for an image:

  #img1 {  filter: grayscale(1);}#img2 {  filter:

The CSS hue-rotate() Function
The hue-rotate() filter function applies a color rotation to an element.
This function applies a hue rotation on the image. The value defines the 
number of degrees around the color circle the image will be adjusted. A positive 
hue rotation increases the hue value, while a negative rotation decreases the 
hue value. 0deg represents the original image.

Example
Set various color rotations for an image:

  #img1 {  filter: hue-rotate(200deg);}#img2 {  filter: 
  hue-rotate(90deg);}#img3 {  filter: hue-rotate(-90deg);
  }
