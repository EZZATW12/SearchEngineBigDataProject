Definition and Usage
The <area> tag defines an area inside an image map (an image map is an image with clickable areas).
<area> elements are always nested inside a 
<map> tag.
Note: The usemap attribute in <img> is associated with 
the <map> element's 
name attribute, and creates a relationship between the image and the map.
