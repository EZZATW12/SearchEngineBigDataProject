CSS Flex Container

❮ Previous
Next ❯


The CSS Flex Container
Like we specified in the previous chapter, this is a flex container
(the blue area) with three flex items:

1
2
3

The flex container becomes flexible by setting the display property to
flex:

Example

  .flex-container {  
  display: flex;}
Try it Yourself »

The CSS properties we use for the flex container are:

flex-direction
flex-wrap
flex-flow
justify-content
align-items
align-content







The CSS flex-direction Property
The flex-direction property specifies the display-direction of flex items in the flex container.
The flex-direction property can have one of the following values:

 row
 column
 row-reverse
 column-reverse


Example
The row value is the default value, and it 
displays the flex items horizontally (from left to right):

  .flex-container {  
  display: flex;  
  flex-direction: row;}

Result:


1
2
3


Try it Yourself »


Example
The column value displays the flex items vertically (from top to bottom):

  .flex-container {  
  display: flex;  
  flex-direction: column;}

Result:


1
2
3


Try it Yourself »


Example
The row-reverse value displays the flex items horizontally (but from right to left):

  .flex-container {  
  display: flex;  
  flex-direction: row-reverse;}

Result:


1
2
3


Try it Yourself »


Example
The column-reverse value displays the flex items vertically (but from bottom to top):

  .flex-container {  
  display: flex;  
  flex-direction: column-reverse;}

Result:


1
2
3

The CSS flex-wrap Property
The flex-wrap property specifies whether the flex items should wrap or not, 
if there is not enough room for them on one flex line.
The flex-wrap property can have one of the following values:

 nowrap
 wrap
 wrap-reverse


Example
The nowrap value specifies that the flex items will not wrap (this 
is default):

  .flex-container {  
  display: flex;  
  flex-wrap: nowrap;}

Result:


1
2
3

The CSS align-content Property
The align-content property is used to align the flex lines.
The align-content property is

flex items, it aligns the flex lines.
The align-content property can have one of the following values:

 center
 stretch
 flex-start
 flex-end
 space-around
 space-between
 space-evenly

In the following examples we use a 600 pixels high container, with the 
flex-wrap property set to wrap, to better demonstrate the align-content property.

Example
With center, the flex lines are packed toward the center of the container:

  .flex-container {  
  display: flex;  height: 600px;  
  flex-wrap: wrap;  
  align-content: center;

  center;  align-items: center;}
