Differences Between SVG and Canvas
SVG is a language for describing 2D graphics in XML, while Canvas draws 2D graphics, on the fly (with JavaScript).
SVG is XML based, which means that every element is available within the SVG 
DOM. You can attach JavaScript event handlers to SVG graphics.
In SVG, each drawn shape is remembered as an object. If attributes of an SVG 
object are changed, the browser can automatically re-render the shape.
Canvas is rendered pixel by pixel. In canvas, once the graphic is drawn, it is forgotten by the browser. If its 
position should be changed, the entire scene needs to be redrawn, including any 
objects that might have been covered by the graphic.



Comparison of SVG and Canvas
The table below shows some important differences between Canvas and SVG:
