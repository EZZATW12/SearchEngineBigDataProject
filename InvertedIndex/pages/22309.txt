HTML Forms

An HTML form is used to collect user input. The user input is 
most often sent to a server for processing. 


Example


First name:

Last name:

The <form> Element
The HTML <form> element is used to 
create an HTML form for user input:


 <form>
 .
form elements
 .
 </form>


The <form> element is a container for different types of input elements, 
such as: text fields, checkboxes, radio 
buttons, submit buttons, etc.
All
the different form elements are covered in this chapter:
HTML Form Elements.




The <input> Element
The HTML <input> element is the most 
used form element. 
An <input> element can be displayed in 
many ways, depending on the type 
attribute.
Here are some examples:


Type
Description


<input type="text">
Displays a single-line text input field


<input type="radio">
Displays a radio button (for selecting one of many choices)


<input type="checkbox">
Displays a checkbox (for selecting zero or more of many choices)


<input type="submit">
Displays a submit button (for submitting the form)


<input type="button">
Displays a clickable button


All the different input types are covered in this chapter:
HTML Input Types.









Text Fields
The <input type="text"> defines a single-line input field for 
text input.

Example
A form with input fields for text:

 <form>
    <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>  <input 
  type="text" id="fname" name="fname"><br>  <label for="lname">Last 
  name:</label><br>  <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname"></form>

This is how the HTML code above will be displayed in a browser:

First name:

Last name:


Note: The form itself is not visible. Also note that the default width 
of an input field is 20 characters.




The <label> Element
Notice the use of the <label> element in the 
example above. 
The <label> tag defines a label for many 
form elements.
The <label> element is useful for 
screen-reader users, because the screen-reader will read out loud the label when 
the user focuses on the input element.
The <label> element also helps users who have 
difficulty clicking on very small regions (such as radio buttons or checkboxes) 
- because when the user clicks the text within the <label> element, it toggles 
the radio button/checkbox.
The for attribute of the <label> tag should 
be equal to the id attribute of the <input>  
element to bind them together. 



Radio Buttons
The <input type="radio"> defines a radio button.
Radio buttons let a user select ONE of a limited number of choices.

Example
A form with radio buttons:

<p>Choose your favorite Web language:</p>
<form>  <input type="radio" id="html" name="fav_language" 
  value="HTML">  <label for="html">HTML</label><br>  <input 
  type="radio" id="css" name="fav_language" value="CSS">  <label 
  for="css">CSS</label><br>  <input type="radio" id="javascript" 
  name="fav_language" value="JavaScript">  <label for="javascript">JavaScript</label></form>

CSS

Checkboxes
The <input type="checkbox"> defines a checkbox.
Checkboxes let a user select ZERO or MORE options of a limited number of choices.

Example
A form with checkboxes:

 <form>  <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle1" name="vehicle1" value="Bike">  
  <label for="vehicle1"> I have a bike</label><br>  <input

The Submit Button
The <input type="submit"> defines a button for submitting the form data to a form-handler.
The form-handler is typically a file on the server with a script for processing 
input data.
The form-handler is specified in the form's action 
attribute.

Example
A form with a submit button:

 <form action="/action_page.php">  <label for="fname">First 
  name:</label><br>  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" 
  value="John"><br>  <label for="lname">Last name:</label><br>  
  <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname" value="Doe"><br><br>  
  <input type="submit" value="Submit"></form>

Last name:






The Name Attribute for <input>
Notice that each input field must have a name attribute to be submitted.
If the name attribute is omitted, the value of the input field will not be sent at all.

Example
This example will not submit the value of the "First name" input field: 

 <form action="/action_page.php">  <label for="fname">First 
  name:</label><br>  <input type="text" id="fname" value="John"><br><br>  
  <input type="submit" value="Submit"></form>
