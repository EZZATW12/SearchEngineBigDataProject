 MySQL Data Types

❮ Previous
Next ❯


The data type of a column defines what value the column can hold: 
integer, character, money, date and time, binary, 
and so on.

MySQL Data Types (Version 8.0)
Each column in a database table is required to have a name and a data type.
An SQL developer must decide what type of data that will be stored inside each 
column when creating a table. The data type is a 
guideline for SQL to understand what type of data is expected inside of each 
column, and it also identifies how SQL will interact with the stored data.
In MySQL there are three main data types: string, numeric, and date and time.
String Data Types



Data type
Description


CHAR(size)
A FIXED length string (can contain letters, numbers, and special characters). The
      size parameter specifies the column length in characters - can be 
      from 0 to   255. Default is 1


VARCHAR(size)
A VARIABLE length string (can contain letters, numbers, and special 
      characters). The size parameter specifies the maximum column 
      length in characters - can be from 0 to 65535


BINARY(size)
Equal to CHAR(), but stores binary byte strings. The size 
      parameter specifies the column length in bytes. Default is 1


VARBINARY(size)
Equal to VARCHAR(), but stores binary byte strings. The size 
      parameter specifies the maximum column length in bytes.


TINYBLOB
For BLOBs (Binary Large OBjects). Max length: 255 bytes


TINYTEXT
Holds a string with a maximum length of 255 characters


TEXT(size)
Holds a string with a maximum length of 65,535 bytes


BLOB(size)
For BLOBs (Binary Large OBjects). Holds up to 65,535 bytes of data


MEDIUMTEXT
Holds a string with a maximum length of 16,777,215 characters


MEDIUMBLOB
For BLOBs (Binary Large OBjects). Holds up to 16,777,215 bytes of data


LONGTEXT
Holds a string with a maximum length of 4,294,967,295 characters


LONGBLOB
For BLOBs (Binary Large OBjects). Holds up to 4,294,967,295 bytes of data


ENUM(val1, val2, val3, ...)
A string object that can have only one value, chosen from a list of possible values. You can list up to 65535 values in an ENUM list. If a value is inserted that is not in the list, a   blank value will be inserted. 
      The values are sorted in the order you enter them


SET(val1, val2, val3, ...)
A string object that can have 0 or more values, chosen from a list of 
      possible values. You can list up to 64 values in a SET list









Numeric Data Types



Data type
Description


BIT(size)
A bit-value type. The number of bits per value is specified in size. 
      The size parameter can hold a value from 1 to 64. The default 
      value for size is 1.


TINYINT(size)
A very small integer. Signed range is from -128 to 127. Unsigned range 
      is from 0 to 255. The size parameter specifies the maximum 
      display width (which is 255)


BOOL
Zero is considered as false, nonzero values are considered as true. 


BOOLEAN
Equal to BOOL


SMALLINT(size)
A small integer. Signed range is from -32768 to 32767. Unsigned range 
      is from 0 to 65535. The size parameter specifies the maximum 
      display width (which is 255)


MEDIUMINT(size)
A medium integer. Signed range is from -8388608 to 8388607. Unsigned 
      range is from 0 to 16777215. The size parameter specifies the 
      maximum display width (which is 255)


INT(size)
A medium integer. Signed range is from -2147483648 to 2147483647. 
      Unsigned range is from 0 to 4294967295. The size parameter 
      specifies the maximum display width (which is 255)


INTEGER(size)
Equal to INT(size)


BIGINT(size)
A large integer. Signed range is from -9223372036854775808 to 
      9223372036854775807. Unsigned range is from 0 to 18446744073709551615. The
      size parameter specifies the maximum display width (which is 255)


FLOAT(size, d)
A floating point number. The total number of digits is specified in 
      size. The   number of digits after the decimal point is specified 
      in the d parameter. This syntax is deprecated in MySQL 8.0.17, 
      and it will be removed in future MySQL versions


FLOAT(p)
A floating point number. MySQL uses the p value to determine 
      whether to use FLOAT or DOUBLE for the resulting data type. If p 
      is from 0 to 24, the data type becomes FLOAT(). If p is from 25 to 
      53, the data type becomes DOUBLE()


DOUBLE(size, d)
A normal-size floating point number. The total number of digits is specified in 
      size. The   number of digits after the decimal point is specified 
      in the d parameter


DOUBLE PRECISION(size, d)
 


DECIMAL(size, d)
An exact fixed-point number. The   total number of digits is specified in 
      size. The   number of digits after the decimal point is specified 
      in the d parameter. The maximum number for size is 65. 
      The maximum number for d is 30. The default value for size 
      is 10. The default value for d is 0.


DEC(size, d)
Equal to DECIMAL(size,d)



Note: All the numeric data types may have an extra option: UNSIGNED 
or ZEROFILL. If you add the UNSIGNED option, MySQL disallows negative values for 
the column. If you add the ZEROFILL option, MySQL automatically also adds the 
UNSIGNED attribute to the column.
Date and Time Data Types


Data type
Description


DATE
A date. Format: YYYY-MM-DD. The supported range is from '1000-01-01' to '9999-12-31'


DATETIME(fsp)
A date and time combination. Format: YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss. The supported range is from '1000-01-01 00:00:00' to '9999-12-31 23:59:59'. 
      Adding DEFAULT and ON UPDATE in the column definition to get automatic 
      initialization and updating to the current date and time


TIMESTAMP(fsp)
A timestamp. TIMESTAMP values are stored as the number of seconds since the Unix epoch ('1970-01-01 00:00:00' UTC). Format: YYYY-MM-DD   
      hh:mm:ss. The supported range is from '1970-01-01 00:00:01'   UTC to '2038-01-09 03:14:07' UTC. 
      Automatic initialization and updating to the current date and time can be 
      specified using DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP and ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP 
      in the column definition


TIME(fsp)
A time. Format: hh:mm:ss. The supported range is from '-838:59:59' to '838:59:59'


YEAR
A year in four-digit format. Values allowed in four-digit format: 1901 to 2155, and 0000.
      MySQL 8.0 does not support year in two-digit format.
