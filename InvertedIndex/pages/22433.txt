RGB Colors
RGB color values are supported in all browsers.
An RGB color value is specified with:
rgb(red, green, blue)
Each parameter (red, green, and 
blue) defines the intensity of the color with a value between 0 and 255.
For example, rgb(255, 0, 0) is displayed as red, 
because red is set to its highest value (255), and the other two (green and blue) are 
set to 0.
Another example, rgb(0, 255, 0) is displayed as green, 
because green is set to its highest value (255), and the other two (red and blue) are 
set to 0.
To display black, set all color parameters to 0, like this: rgb(0, 0, 0).
To display white, set all color parameters to 255, like 
this: rgb(255, 255, 255).  


Try it Yourself
RGB color values are supported in all browsers.

Example

<style>
div {    background-color: rgb(0, 191, 255);    color: rgb(255, 255, 255);}
</style>

RGBA Color Values
RGBA color values are an extension of RGB color values with an Alpha channel - which specifies the opacity for a color.
An RGBA color value is specified with:
rgba(red, green, blue, 
alpha)
The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transparent at all):

Example

  <h1 style="background-color:rgba(255, 99, 71, 0.2);">rgba(255, 99, 71, 
  0.2)</h1><h1 style="background-color:rgba(255, 99, 71, 0.4);">rgba(255, 
  99, 71, 0.4)</h1><h1 style="background-color:rgba(255, 99, 71, 0.6);">rgba(255, 
  99, 71, 0.6)</h1><h1 style="background-color:rgba(255, 99, 71, 0.8);">rgba(255, 
  99, 71, 0.8)</h1>
