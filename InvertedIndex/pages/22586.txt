The align-items property is used to 
align the flex items when they do not use all available vertical space.
It can have one of the following values:

 center
 flex-start
 flex-end
 stretch

 normal


Example

<div class="w3-flex" style="align-items:center">

Example
The baseline value positions the flex items 
at the baseline of the container:

The align-content Property
The align-content property is used to align the flex lines.
The align-content property is 
similar to align-items, but instead of aligning 
flex items, it aligns the flex lines.
It can have one of the following values:

 center
 stretch
 flex-start
 flex-end
 space-around
 space-between
 space-evenly

In the following examples we use a 300 pixels high container, with the 
flex-wrap property set to wrap, to better demonstrate the align-content property.

Example
With center, the flex lines are packed toward the center of the container:

<div class="w3-flex" style="align-content:center">

Try it Yourself »


Example
With stretch, the flex lines stretch to take 
up the remaining space of the container (this is default):

<div class="w3-flex" style="align-content:stretch">

Try it Yourself »


Example
With flex-start, the flex lines are packed 
toward the start of the container:

<div class="w3-flex" style="align-content:flex-start">

Try it Yourself »


Example
With flex-end, the flex lines are packed 
toward the end of the container: 

<div class="w3-flex" style="align-content:flex-end">

Try it Yourself »


Example
With space-between, the space between the flex lines are 
equal, but the first item is flush with the start edge of the container, and the 
last item is flush with the end edge of the container:

<div class="w3-flex" style="align-content:space-between">

Try it Yourself »


Example
With space-around, the space between the flex lines are 
equal, but the space before the first item and after the last item is set to 
half of the space between the flex lines:

<div class="w3-flex" style="align-content:space-around">

Try it Yourself »


Example
With space-evenly, the flex lines are evenly distributed in the flex container, with equal space 
on top, bottom and between:

<div class="w3-flex" style="align-content:space-evenly">

Perfect Centering
In the following example we will solve a common style problem: perfect 
centering.

1
2
3

SOLUTION: Set both the justify-content and align-items properties to
center, and the flex item will be perfectly centered:

Example

<div class="w3-flex" style="height:300px;justify-content:center;align-items:center">
