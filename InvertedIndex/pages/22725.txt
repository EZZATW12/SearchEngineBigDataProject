HTML Table Colgroup

❮ Previous
Next ❯


The <colgroup> element is used to style specific 
columns of a table.


HTML Table Colgroup

If you want to style the first two columns of a table, use the <colgroup>
and <col>
elements.

The <colgroup> element should be used as a container for the column 
specifications.
Each group is specified with a <col> element.
The span attribute specifies how many columns get the style.
The style attribute specifies the style to give the columns.

Note: There is a very limited selection of legal CSS properties for colgroups.


Example

  <table>  <colgroup>    <col span="2" 
  style="background-color: #D6EEEE">  </colgroup>
    <tr>    <th>MON</th>    <th>TUE</th>    
  <th>WED</th>    <th>THU</th>... 
Try it Yourself »


Note: The <colgroup> tag must be a 
child of a <table> element and should be placed 
before any other table elements, like <thead>,
<tr>, <td> 
etc., but after the <caption> element, if 
present.




Legal CSS Properties

There is only a very limited selection of CSS properties that are allowed to be used in the colgroup:

width property
visibility property
background properties
border properties

All other CSS properties will have no effect on your tables.









Multiple Col Elements
If you want to style multiple columns with different styles, use more than 
one
<col> element inside the
<colgroup>:

Example

  <table>  <colgroup>    <col span="2" 
  style="background-color: #D6EEEE">    <col span="3" 
  style="background-color: pink">  </colgroup>  <tr>    <th>MON</th>    <th>TUE</th>    
  <th>WED</th>    <th>THU</th>... 
Try it Yourself »




Empty Colgroups

If you want 
to style columns in the middle of a table, insert an "empty" 
<col> element (with no 
styles) for the columns before:


Example

  <table>  <colgroup>    <col span="3">    
  <col 
  span="2" 
  style="background-color: pink">  </colgroup>  <tr>    <th>MON</th>    <th>TUE</th>    
  <th>WED</th>    <th>THU</th>... 
Try it Yourself »




Hide Columns
You can hide columns with the visibility: collapse property:

Example

  <table>  <colgroup>    <col span="2">    <col span="3" 
  style="visibility: collapse">  </colgroup>
    <tr>    <th>MON</th>    <th>TUE</th>    
  <th>WED</th>    <th>THU</th>... 
Try it Yourself »
