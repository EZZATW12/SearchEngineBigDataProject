CSS Layout - Overflow

❮ Previous
Next ❯


The CSS overflow property controls what 
happens to content that is too big to fit into an area.
This text is really long and the height of its container is only 100 pixels. Therefore, a scrollbar is added to help the reader to scroll the content. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit, sed diam nonummy nibh euismod tincidunt ut laoreet dolore magna aliquam erat volutpat. Ut wisi enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exerci tation ullamcorper suscipit lobortis nisl ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis autem vel eum iriure dolor in hendrerit in vulputate velit esse molestie consequat, vel illum dolore eu feugiat nulla facilisis at vero eros et accumsan et iusto odio dignissim qui blandit praesent luptatum zzril delenit augue duis dolore te feugait nulla facilisi. Nam liber tempor cum soluta nobis eleifend option congue nihil imperdiet doming id quod mazim placerat facer possim assum. Typi non habent claritatem insitam; est usus legentis in iis qui facit eorum claritatem.

CSS Overflow
The overflow property specifies whether to clip 
the content or 
to add scrollbars when the content of an element is too big to fit in the specified 
area.
The overflow property has the following values:

visible - Default. The overflow is not clipped. 
The content renders outside the element's box
hidden - The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be invisible
scroll - The overflow is clipped, and a scrollbar is added to see the rest of the content
auto - Similar to scroll, 
but it adds scrollbars only when necessary


Note: The overflow property only works for block elements with a specified height.
Note: In OS X Lion (on Mac), scrollbars are hidden by default and only shown when being used (even though "overflow:scroll" is set).


overflow: visible
By default, the overflow is visible, meaning that it is not clipped and it 
renders outside the element's box:
You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content overflows an element's box.

Example

div {  width: 200px;  height: 
  65px;  background-color: coral;  
overflow: visible;}

overflow: hidden
With the hidden value, the overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content is hidden:
You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content overflows an element's box.

Example

div {  overflow: hidden;}
