CSS Web Safe Fonts

❮ Previous
Next ❯


What are Web Safe Fonts?
Web safe fonts are fonts that are universally installed across all browsers and devices.

Fallback Fonts
However, there are no 100% completely web safe fonts. There is always a 
chance that a font is not found or is not installed properly.
Therefore, it is very important to always use fallback fonts.
This means that you should add a list of similar "backup fonts" in 
the font-family 
property. If the 
first font does not work, the browser will try the next one, and the next one, and so on. 
Always end the list with a generic font family name.

Example
Here, there are three font types: Tahoma, Verdana, and 
sans-serif. The second and third fonts are backups, in case the first one is not found.

p {font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, sans-serif;}

Best Web Safe Fonts for HTML and CSS
The following list are the best web safe fonts for HTML and CSS: 

Arial (sans-serif)
Verdana (sans-serif)
Tahoma (sans-serif)
Trebuchet MS (sans-serif)
Times New Roman (serif)
Georgia (serif)
Garamond (serif)
Courier New (monospace)
Brush Script MT (cursive)


Note: Before you publish your website, always check how your 
fonts appear on different browsers and devices, and always use 
fallback fonts!
