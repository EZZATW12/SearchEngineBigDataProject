Java Keywords

Java Reserved Keywords
Java has a set of keywords that are reserved words that cannot be used as 
variables, methods, classes, or any other identifiers:


Keyword
Description


abstract
A non-access modifier. Used for classes and methods: An abstract class cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class). An abstract method can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the subclass (inherited from)


assert
For debugging


boolean
A data type that can only store true or false values


break
Breaks out of a loop or a switch block


byte
A data type that can store whole numbers from -128 and 127


case
Marks a block of code in switch statements


catch
Catches exceptions generated by try statements


char
A data type that is used to store a single character


class
Defines a class


continue
Continues to the next iteration of a loop


const
Defines a constant. Not in use - use final instead


default
Specifies the default block of code in a switch statement


do
Used together with while to create a do-while loop


double
A data type that can store fractional numbers from 1.7e−308 to 1.7e+308


else
Used in conditional statements


enum
Declares an enumerated (unchangeable) type


exports
Exports a package with a module. New in Java 9


extends
Extends a class (indicates that a class is inherited from another class)


final
A non-access modifier used for classes, attributes and methods, which makes them non-changeable (impossible to inherit or override)


finally
Used with exceptions, a block of code that will be executed no matter if there is an exception or not


float
A data type that can store fractional numbers from 3.4e−038 to 3.4e+038


for
Create a for loop


goto
Not in use, and has no function


if
Makes a conditional statement


implements
Implements an interface


import
Used to import a package, class or interface


instanceof
Checks whether an object is an instance of a specific class or an interface


int
A data type that can store whole numbers from -2147483648 to 2147483647


interface
Used to declare a special type of class that only contains abstract methods


long
A data type that can store whole numbers from -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775808


module
Declares a module. New in Java 9


native
Specifies that a method is not implemented in the same Java source file (but in another language)


new
Creates new objects


package
Declares a package


private
An access modifier used for attributes, methods and constructors, making them only accessible within the declared class


protected
An access modifier used for attributes, methods and constructors, making them accessible in the same package and subclasses


public
An access modifier used for classes, attributes, methods and constructors, making them accessible by any other class


requires
Specifies required libraries inside a module. New in Java 9


return
Finished the execution of a method, and can be used to return a value from a method


short
A data type that can store whole numbers from -32768 to 32767


static
A non-access modifier used for methods and attributes. Static methods/attributes can be accessed without creating an object of a class


strictfp
Obsolete. Restrict the precision and rounding of floating point calculations


super
Refers to superclass (parent) objects


switch
Selects one of many code blocks to be executed


synchronized
A non-access modifier, which specifies that methods can only be accessed by one thread at a time


this
Refers to the current object in a method or constructor


throw
Creates a custom error


throws
Indicates what exceptions may be thrown by a method


transient
Used to ignore an attribute when serializing an object


try
Creates a try...catch statement


var
Declares a variable. New in Java 10


void
Specifies that a method should not have a return value


volatile
Indicates that an attribute is not cached thread-locally, and is always read from the "main memory"
