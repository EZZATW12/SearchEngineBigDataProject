Grid Container
A grid container contains one or more grid items arranged in columns and rows.
Direct child elements(s) of the grid container automatically becomes grid items.
An element becomes a grid container when its display property 
is set to grid or inline-grid.

Grid Tracks
The rows and columns of a grid is defined with the grid-template-rows 
and the grid-template-columns properties (or 
the shorthand grid or grid-template 
properties).
These define the grid tracks. A grid track is the space between two adjacent grid lines.

The grid-template-columns Property
The grid-template-columns property defines the 
number of columns in your grid layout, and it can define the width of each column.
The value is a space-separated-list, where each value defines the width 
of the respective column.
If you want your grid layout to contain 4 columns, specify the width of the 4 columns, or "auto" if all columns should have the same width.

Example
Make a grid with 4 columns of equal width:

  .grid-container {
    display: grid;  
  grid-template-columns: auto auto auto auto;}

Result:


1

The grid-template-columns property can also be used to specify the 
exact size (width) of the columns, or a mix of fixed size and auto.

Example
Set a fixed size for column 1, 2, and 4, and keep column 3 as auto size:

  .grid-container {
    display: grid;  
  grid-template-columns: 80px 200px auto 40px;}

Result:


1

Note: If you have more than 4 grid items in a 4 columns grid, the grid will automatically 
add a new row to put the items in.


Cell Sizing with the fr Unit
The fr unit can be used when defining grids, 
like any other CSS length such as %, px or em.
The fr unit stands for "fraction". 
This unit automatically divides the available space into fractions.
Example: 1fr will take 1 fraction of the available space, while 2fr will take 
2 fractions of the available space.

Example
Here, each column will take up 25% of the container width, splitting it equally:

  .grid-container {
    display: grid;  
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;}

Result:

Example
Here, the second column will be twice as big as the others:

  .grid-container {

  grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr 1fr;}

The grid-template-rows Property
The grid-template-rows property defines the height of each row.
The value is a space-separated-list, where each value defines the height of the respective row:

Example

  .grid-container {
    display: grid;  
  grid-template-rows: 80px 200px;}

Result:

Notice that the first row in the grid above is 80px high and the second row is 200px high. 
The next rows will use auto as default.







The justify-content Property
The justify-content property is used to 
align the grid items when they do not use all available space on the main-axis (horizontally).
The justify-content property can have one of the following values:

space-evenly
space-around
space-between
center 
start
end


Note: The grid item's total width has to be less than the container's width for the justify-content property to have any effect.


Example
The space-evenly value displays the grid items with equal space around them:

  .grid-container {
    display: grid;  
  justify-content: space-evenly;}

Result:


1
2
3

Example
The space-around value displays the grid items with space 
around them:

  .grid-container {
    display: grid;  
  justify-content: space-around;}

Result:

Example
The space-between value displays the grid items with space between them:

  .grid-container {
    display: grid;  
  justify-content: space-between;}

Result:

  .grid-container {
    display: grid;  
  justify-content: center;}

  justify-content: start;}

  .grid-container {
    display: grid;  
  justify-content: end;}

The align-content Property
The align-content property is used to 
align the grid items when they do not use all available space on the cross-axis (vertically).
The align-content property can have one of the following values:

space-evenly
space-around
space-between
center 
start
end


Note: The grid item's total height has to be less than the container's height for the align-content property to have any effect.

In the following examples we use a 400 pixels high container, to better demonstrate the align-content property.


Example
The center value positions the grid items in the middle of the container:

  .grid-container {
    display: grid;  height: 400px;  
  align-content: center;}

Result:


1
2
3
4

Try it Yourself »


Example
With space-evenly, the grid lines are evenly distributed in the 
  grid container, with equal space 
on top, bottom and between:

  .grid-container {
    display: grid;  height: 400px;  
  align-content: space-evenly;}

Result:


1
2

Try it Yourself »


Example
With space-around, the space between the 
  grid lines are 
equal, but the space before the first grid item and after the last grid item is set to 
half of the space between the grid lines:

  .grid-container {
    display: grid;  height: 400px;  
  align-content: space-around;}

Result:


1

Example
With space-between, the space between the 
  grid lines are 
equal, but the first grid item is flush with the start edge of the container, and the 
last grid item is flush with the end edge of the container:

  .grid-container {
    display: grid;  height: 400px;  
  align-content: space-between;}

Result:

The place-content Property
The place-content property is a shorthand 
property for the align-content and the 
justify-content properties.
If the place-content property has two 
values:

 place-content: start center; - the align-content 
  value is 'start' and 
justify-content value is 'center'

If the place-content property has one value:

 place-content: end; - both align-content 
  and 
justify-content values are 'end'


Note: The grid item's total height and width has to be less than the container's height 
and width for the place-content property to have any effect.


Example
The center value positions the grid items in the middle of the container 
  (both vertically and horizontally):

  .grid-container {
    display: grid;  height: 400px;  
  place-content: center;}

Example
The end space-between value aligns the grid lines towards the bottom of the grid container, 
  and aligns the grid items with the same space between them horizontally:

  .grid-container {
    display: grid;  height: 400px;  
  place-content: end space-between;}
