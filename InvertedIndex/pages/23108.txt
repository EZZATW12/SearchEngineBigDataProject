Responsive Rows
W3.CSS's grid system is responsive. The columns will re-arrange automatically depending on the screen size: On a big screen it might look better with the content organized in three columns, but on a small screen it 
might be better if the content were stacked on top of each other.


Class
Description


w3-row
Container for responsive classes, with no padding


w3-row-padding
Container for responsive classes, with 8px left and right padding


w3-col
Defines one column in a 12-column responsive grid


w3-col has the following sub classes:
Columns for small screens (typical smart phones):


Class
Description


s1
Defines 1 of 12 columns (width:08.33%) for small screens 


s2
Defines 2 of 12 columns (width:16.66%) for small screens


s3
Defines 3 of 12 columns (width:25.00%) for small screens


s4
Defines 4 of 12 columns (width:33.33%) for small screens


s5 - s11
 


s12
Defines 12 of 12 columns (width:100%). Default for small screens


Columns for medium screens (typical tablets):


Class
Description


m1
Defines 1 of 12 columns (width:08.33%) for medium screens


m2
Defines 2 of 12 columns (width:16.66%) for medium screens


m3
Defines 3 of 12 columns (width:25.00%) for medium screens


m4
Defines 4 of 12 columns (width:33.33%) for medium screens


m5 - m11 
 


m12
Defines 12 of 12 columns (width:100%). Default for medium screens


Columns for large screens (typical laptops and desktops):


Class
Description


l1
Defines 1 of 12 columns (width:08.33%) for large screens


l2
Defines 2 of 12 columns (width:16.66%) for large screens


l3
Defines 3 of 12 columns (width:25.00%) for large screens


l4
Defines 4 of 12 columns (width:33.33%) for large screens


l5 - l11
 


l12
Defines 12 of 12 columns (width:100%). Default for large screens)


The classes above can be combined to create more dynamic and flexible layouts. 

Each class scales up, so if you wish to set the same width for small, medium and large screens, you only 
need to specify the small class. And if you want the same width on medium and large screens, you only need to 
specify the medium class.
However, if you only use medium and/or large classes, the width will always 
transform to 100% on small screens.
Note: The number of columns should always add up to 12 for 
each row (6+6, 3+3+6, 9+3, etc)!

Mixed: Mobile and Laptops
You can combine classes to create a dynamic and flexible layout. This example 
will produce a two column layout with a 83.34%/16.66% (l10, l2) split on large screens and a 50%/50% 
(s6, s6) 
split on small screens:

l10 s6
l2 s6


Example

<div class="w3-row">  <div class="w3-col l10 s6 w3-pink 
w3-center"><p>l10 s6</p></div>  <div class="w3-col l2 s6 
w3-dark-grey w3-center"><p>l2 s6</p></div>
