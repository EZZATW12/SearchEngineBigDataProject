HTML Canvas Graphics

❮ Previous
Next ❯




Your browser does not support the <canvas> element.

The HTML <canvas> element is used to draw graphics on a web page.
The graphic to the left is created with <canvas>. It shows four 
elements: a red rectangle, a gradient rectangle,
a multicolor rectangle, and a multicolor text.





What is HTML Canvas?
The HTML <canvas> element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via JavaScript.
The <canvas> element is only a container for graphics. You must use  
JavaScript to actually draw the graphics.
Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images.
Canvas is supported by all major browsers.



Canvas Examples
A canvas is a rectangular area on an HTML page. By default, a canvas has no border and no content.
The markup looks like this:

<canvas id="myCanvas" width="200" height="100"></canvas>

Note: Always specify an id attribute (to be referred to in a script), 
and a width and height attribute to define the size of the canvas. To add a border, use the style attribute.
Here is an example of a basic, empty canvas:

Your browser does not support the canvas element.


Example

<canvas id="myCanvas" width="200" height="100"
style="border:1px solid 
#000000;">
</canvas>

Add a JavaScript
After creating the rectangular canvas area, you must add a JavaScript to do 
the drawing.
Here are some examples:

Example

  <script>var c = document.getElementById("myCanvas");var ctx = c.getContext("2d");

  </script>

 grd.addColorStop(0, "red");
 grd.addColorStop(1, "white");

 // Fill with gradient
 ctx.fillStyle = grd;
 ctx.fillRect(10, 10, 150, 80);</script>

Example

   <script>var c = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
 var ctx = c.getContext("2d");

 // Create gradient

 grd.addColorStop(0, "red");
 grd.addColorStop(1, "white");

 // Fill with gradient
