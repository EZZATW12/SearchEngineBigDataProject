Material Design

designers are expected to go for Material Design (Designed by Google in 2014).
Material Design uses elements that remind us of paper and ink. In addition 
the elements have realistic shadows 
and hover effects.

first, and then added responsive web design to make sure 
the web looks good when viewed on a tablet or a phone.
This trend is shifting towards designing for mobiles first, and then add 
responsive design to make a site work on desktops and laptops.
50/50 is an easy way to achieve web design for responsive webs. With 50/50 design,
the screen can show two pages on large screens and one page on narrow screens.

Large Hero Images
"Hero image" is a term used for a specific type of web banner.
A hero image is a large image, placed in the front of a web page. It often consists of 
both an image and some text, and it can be static or a rotating list of images.
The purpose of an hero image is to present the web site's most important content.


Sailing
Brought to you by Captain Hook


Welcome to my Sailing Web
Sailing comprises wind propulsion of a craft by means of sails and steering it over water,
ice or land, depending on the type of craft.
A sailor manages the force of the wind on the sails by adjusting their angle with respect
to the moving sailing craft and sometimes by adjusting the sail area. 
The force transmitted from the sails is resisted by forces from the hull,
keel, and rudder of a sailing craft, by forces from skate runners for an iceboat,
and by forces from wheels for a land sailing craft to allow steering a course on a point of sail
with respect to the true wind. (Wikipedia)

Single Page
The web design trend shifts from regular clicking to vertical scrolling.
Scrolling allows users to see all the web content on the one page.
This single page technique has been used by social networks a long time, until somebody 
discovered that it suits other pages as well.
