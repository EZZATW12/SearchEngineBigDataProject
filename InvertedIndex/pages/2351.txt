The march follows a 3km (1.86 miles) route to the crematorium of Auschwitz-Birkenau, as participants pay tribute to the millions of Jews who died in the Holocaust and call for an end to antisemitism and intolerance. Many of those on the march carried Israeli flags, and called for the release of hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza. Israel's prime minister Isaac Herzog joined the crowds as they made their way through the camp, 80 years after Soviet troops liberated it.3 days agoEuropeIsraelThe HolocaustHolocaust Memorial DayShareSave'Our community is grieving,' say Vancouver festival organisersOrganisers of the festival where a car ramming attack killed 11 people say they are "heartbroken".13 hrs agoWorld'I'm voting for the first time after fleeing a dictatorship'Ghayda and her husband Ahmad say they could never discuss politics in Syria - now, they will vote in Canada's election.2 days agoWorldViral videos claim luxury bags are made in China, is it true?BBC Verify's Jake Horton looks into the truth behind the claims, and what we know about how luxury goods are made.16 Apr 2025World'A number of businesses in limbo' in China after US tariffs on importsBBC China correspondent Laura Bicker has been speaking to companies at the world's longest running import-export fair.15 Apr 2025WorldKey immigration moments from Trump and Bukele meetingThe meeting comes after the Trump administration mistakenly deported a Maryland resident due to an 'administrative error.'
