But what role will he have in the country's next government?Singh is running his third federal election campaign - and one where his party faces an uphill battle as recent polls show some of the lowest levels of support for Canada's left-wing New Democratic Party in years. The NDP faces tough competition in Canada's 2025 election which is being held on 28 April. Prime Minister Mark Carney called it shortly after he was sworn in to replace former leader Justin Trudeau. Launching his party's campaign, Singh attacked both Carney and US President Donald Trump, promising that only the New Democrats could be trusted to look out for ordinary Canadians.A practising Sikh, Singh is a former provincial Ontario legislator and lawyer by training. The 46-year-old took the helm of the party in 2017 despite no previous experience in federal politics.In 2022, Singh's NDP agreed to help prop up Trudeau's minority Liberal government in exchange for support on their shared political priorities, in particular in developing a national dental care programme for low-income Canadians and a national prescription drug programme.A simple guide to Canada's federal electionWho's who in Canada's federal electionBut last September, the NDP became the last of Canada's three main opposition parties to turn on Trudeau, with Singh accusing him of "caving" to corporate greed. The NDP leader has also made headlines for confronting hecklers. He once approached a man who was heckling him with insults on Parliament Hill, asking him to "say it to my face" in a clip that later went viral. He has faced other confrontations in the past, including a voter who told him to "cut  your turban off" during the 2019 election campaign - though he handled that situation cordially, replying that Canadians "look like all sorts of people" before walking away. Singh was born in Scarborough, Ontario, a city in the Greater Toronto Area, to Indian immigrants from the state of Punjab. Singh has said he was sexually abused by a taekwondo teacher as a child, revealing in a memoir later in life that he suffered the abuse while growing up in Windsor. As a child, he also spent time in St Johns, and attended school across the border in Michigan for several years. He later got a degree in biology from the University of Western Ontario and a Bachelor of Laws from York University's Osgoode Hall Law School.Singh worked as a criminal defence attorney for years before pursuing provincial politics, eventually running provincially for a seat in the Ontario legislature in 2011.In 2019, he won his first seat in Canada's parliament in by-election - or special election -  in Burnaby, British Columbia, east of Vancouver.The former human rights activist ran on pledges to forgive student loan debt, to drastically reduce Canada's carbon emissions and to ensure universal prescription drug coverage. He has found a large audience on TikTok and is also known for his style and well-tailored suits, with BuzzFeed once calling him the "most stylish politician in Canada by like a million kilometres".He is married to fashion designer Gurkiran Kaur Sidhu, with whom he has two children. Recently, he revealed he had considered leaving politics in late 2023, after he was warned by federal police  that he had received credible death threats. His wife at the time was pregnant with their second child. He was under heavy police protection for weeks.Trudeau's key ally says he will vote to topple himJagmeet Singh wins seat in Canada electionCanada election 2025CanadaRelatedWhen will we get results of the Canada election?51 mins agoUS & CanadaThe 'Trump effect' and other things to watch for as Canada votes2 hrs agoUS & CanadaCanada votes in pivotal election transformed by Trump5 hrs agoUS & CanadaMore1 hr agoGirl, 5, among Vancouver dead as suspect chargedAt least 10 others were killed after a car drove into a crowd at a street festival in Vancouver, Canada on Saturday night. 1 hr agoUS & Canada4 hrs agoSorrow and fury among Vancouver's Filipinos after attack on festivalThe community is reeling after 11 were killed and dozens injured by a car ramming attack on a street event.4 hrs agoUS & Canada6 hrs agoWhat we know about the Vancouver car ramming attackA resident of the city has been charged with murder and work to identify victims is ongoing. 6 hrs agoUS & Canada9 hrs agoA simple guide to Canada's federal electionCanada is holding a national election amid growing tension with the US over trade and tariffs.9 hrs agoUS & Canada11 hrs agoWho is Bloc Québécois leader Yves-François Blanchet?Blanchet has led Quebec's sovereigntist party since 2019, after spending time in provincial politics. 11 hrs agoUS & CanadaBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.
