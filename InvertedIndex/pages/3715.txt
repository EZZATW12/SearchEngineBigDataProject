Quebec Premier François Legault condemned the plot. "It makes no sense that in Quebec – we are not in a movie – there is a contract placed on the head of a journalist because he does his job," he said. "This is not the Quebec we want," he said, adding that the province's police must continue to target organised crime.In order to become an informant for the authorities, Silva had to confess his entire criminal history, La Presse reported. The outlet said it had learned of the plot against Mr Renaud after reviewing the confession Silva had made to police. Silva admitted to contacting two influential organised crime figures about assassinating Mr Renaud while being held on trial in 2021.According to Silva, the figures were hesitant, saying it was a bad idea to target a journalist. The "contract" was in place for roughly two months, but was never carried out, La Presse reported. Silva eventually cancelled the order, he said, because he had "more important issues to deal with". Silva is now serving a life sentence in prison. Mr Renaud told La Presse he was "shaken" by the revelations. "I don't censor myself, but I always exercise restraint so I don’t reveal details about the private lives of criminals and avoid putting lives in danger. So I never thought that I could have ended up the subject of a contract like this," he said. Vincent Marissal, a former colleague of Mr Renaud’s who is now an elected provincial politician with the left-wing Québec Solidaire, called the journalist a “very rigorous person - not the type of guy who makes a lot of noise in the newsroom but apparently he can cause a lot of bother.“That means he's doing his job, but that's certainly no reason to see a price put on his head.”Organised crimeQuebecCanadaRelatedArrests in £200k organised crime crackdown6 days agoEnglandEx-detective risks life to fight crime in war zones18 Apr 2025ShropshireMore shop and barber raids to come, says inspector16 Apr 2025EnglandMore56 mins agoWhen will we get results of the Canada election?Here's how - and when - we will know who won the election and will form the new government in Canada.56 mins agoUS & Canada1 hr agoGirl, 5, among Vancouver dead as suspect chargedAt least 10 others were killed after a car drove into a crowd at a street festival in Vancouver, Canada on Saturday night. 1 hr agoUS & Canada2 hrs agoThe 'Trump effect' and other things to watch for as Canada votesThe BBC's Lyse Doucet breaks down the key issues weighing on voters minds as Canadians cast their ballots.2 hrs agoUS & Canada4 hrs agoSorrow and fury among Vancouver's Filipinos after attack on festivalThe community is reeling after 11 were killed and dozens injured by a car ramming attack on a street event.4 hrs agoUS & Canada5 hrs agoCanada votes in pivotal election transformed by TrumpThe US president came to dominate on the campaign trail, with the contest being viewed as a referendum on how Canada should engage with him.5 hrs agoUS & CanadaBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.
