Despite their criticism of Trump's words, both Nielsen and Frederiksen on Sunday said they would be willing to meet the US president for talks. Nielsen also reiterated that Greenland was prepared to deepen ties with the US, saying: "We are ready for a strong partnership and more development, but we want respect."Nielsen's visit to Denmark follows Frederiksen's own trip to Greenland earlier this month.  "You can't annex other countries," was her message for the US president at the time.It followed Vance's whirlwind visit to the territory, widely criticised in both Denmark and Greenland, in which he reiterated Trump's ambitions and claimed Copenhagen had "not done a good job" for Greenlanders.Greenland, the world's largest island, has been controlled by Denmark for about 300 years. The island governs its own domestic affairs, but foreign and defence policy decisions are made in Copenhagen.The US has long had a security interest in the island. It has had a military base there since World War Two, and Trump may also have an interest in the rare earth minerals that could be mined.Polls show that the vast majority of Greenlanders want to become independent from Denmark but do not wish to become part of the US. Formed in March, Greenland's new coalition government is led by Nielsen's centre-right Democrats party, which favours a gradual approach to independence.Denmark and Greenland show united front against US 'annexation' threatsJD Vance's ominous pitch to Greenland Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?Mette FrederiksenGreenlandDenmarkUnited StatesRelatedDenmark and Greenland show united front against US 'annexation' threats3 Apr 2025WorldGreenland's dark history - and does it want Trump?3 Feb 2025BBC InDepthPolish man jailed for four months for punching Danish PM7 Aug 2024EuropeMore23 mins agoDozens killed in US strike on Yemen migrant centre, Houthis sayHouthi-run media report that the bodies of 68 people have been recovered from the centre, which was holding African migrants.23 mins agoWorld3 hrs agoCanada votes in pivotal election transformed by TrumpThe US president came to dominate on the campaign trail, with the contest being viewed as a referendum on how Canada should engage with him.3 hrs agoUS & Canada8 hrs agoTrump 'thinks' Zelensky ready to give up Crimea to RussiaThe latest comments by the US president come despite Kyiv repeatedly rejecting ceding the peninsula.8 hrs agoWorld8 hrs agoThe rapid remaking of a nation, in 100 daysThe impact of what President Trump has done so far is being felt in every corner of American life.8 hrs agoUS & Canada16 hrs agoDrag Race and Pose star Jiggly Caliente dies aged 44The drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a "severe infection", her family says.16 hrs agoWorldBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.
