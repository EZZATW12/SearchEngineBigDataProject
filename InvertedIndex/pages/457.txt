Russian President Vladimir Putin described Ukraine's efforts in Kursk as a complete failure.Ukraine says its troops are still conducting operations in the Russian border region, with the military describing Moscow's claims as "propaganda tricks".Ukrainian forces have been in retreat in Kursk in recent months, facing 70,000 Russian troops and heavy drone attacks as part of Russia's drive to regain the territory.In its latest report on 25 April, the US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) think-tank said: "Russian forces recently advanced near the international border in Kursk Oblast [region] as part of efforts to push Ukrainian forces from their limited remaining positions in the area."The ISW also reported that "fighting continued in [Russia's] north-western Belgorod Oblast [region] on 25 April".During a video conference meeting with Putin on Saturday, Gerasimov said: "Today, the last settlement in the Kursk region, the village of Gornal, has been liberated from Ukrainian forces."Gerasimov said more than 76,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed and wounded in the Kursk region - a claim not verified independently.He also praised North Korean troops for providing "significant assistance in defeating the group of Ukrainian armed forces"."The Kyiv regime's adventure has completely failed," Putin told Gerasimov in response, claiming that it would pave the way for further Russian advances on other fronts.Russia's military says its troops now control several settlements in Ukraine's north-eastern Sumy region, located next to Kursk.Responding in a post on Telegram, the Ukrainian military's general staff said the situation on the battlefield was "difficult" - but insisted its forces were still holding positions in Kursk and were continuing an incursion in the Belgorod region, which lies immediately south of Kursk.Ukraine's incursion was launched last August as an attempt to create a buffer zone on the border between the two countries that would prevent Russian forces from being deployed on Ukraine's eastern front line. It comes a day after US President Donald Trump said Russia and Ukraine were "very close to a deal" on ending the war, following talks between his envoy Steve Witkoff and Putin this week.But Trump on Saturday questioned Putin's willingness to end the war, referencing Russia's attacks on Kyiv earlier this week which killed at least 12 people and injured 90 others.His comments followed a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on the sidelines of Pope Francis's funeral at the Vatican - their first face-to-face encounter since February's acrimonious Oval Office showdown.The White House struck a more positive tone about Saturday's meeting, while Zelensky described the sit down as a "very symbolic meeting that has potential to become historic, if we achieve joint results".Ukraine's leader told the BBC on Friday that he was pushing for a "full and unconditional ceasefire" before any deal was struck.Kyiv has faced growing pressure from Trump to accept territorial concessions as part of any deal with Moscow to end fighting, which could reportedly include giving up the Crimean peninsula which was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014. Zelensky has repeatedly rejected any such concessions.Ukraine had hoped it could use the land it had seized in the Kursk region as a bargaining chip in future peace talks with Russia, which launched its full-scale invasion in 2022 and currently controls around 20% of Ukraine's internationally-recognised territory.More on this storyZelensky and Trump hold 'very productive' talks at Vatican'Everything is finished': Ukrainian troops relive retreat from KurskUkraine war in maps: How control has shifted in three yearsEuropeWar in UkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyVladimir PutinUkraineRelatedTrump 'thinks' Zelensky ready to give up Crimea to Russia8 hrs agoWorldEighty years on, survivors and families remember horrors of Bergen Belsen12 hrs agoEuropeThousands line Rome's streets as Pope Francis laid to rest after Vatican funeral2 days agoEuropeMore4 hrs agoN Korea confirms it sent troops to fight for Russia in Ukraine warIt comes just days after Russia's Valery Gerasimov praised the "heroism" of North Korean troops. 4 hrs agoAsia18 hrs agoBristol in Pictures: The Manics rock the BeaconOur weekly round-up includes Rovers, St George's Day, The Manics and the Christmas Steps.18 hrs agoEngland1 day agoTrump questions Putin's desire for peace after meeting Zelensky at the VaticanThe US president says he fears the Russian leader is "tapping me along" given Moscow's strikes on Kyiv earlier this week.1 day agoWorld2 days agoRussia detains suspect in car bomb attack that killed generalThe FSB say they detained a "Ukrainian special services agent".
