Natalie Berg, retail analyst at NBK Retail, said such incidents "erodes consumer trust in the brand"."I think shoppers are generally forgiving when these incidents occur, but they expect it to be resolved quickly."Customers began reporting problems last weekend - with people struggling to use contactless payments, click & collect, and gift cards - and on Tuesday the retailer confirmed it was facing a "cyber incident".Then on Friday M&S said it was pausing taking orders through its UK & Ireland websites and apps and some international websites.It apologised for the inconvenience and said it would refund orders placed by customers on Friday.M&S says contactless payments are now working and gift cards can be used.Online grocer Ocado, which sells M&S food on its platform, is unaffected by the problems as it runs on an entirely separate system.M&S stops online orders and issues refunds after cyber attackCyber attack on M&S leads to click and collect delaysWith warmer weather due this week, and shoppers turning their thoughts to summer, analysts said M&S could be missing out on sales at a critical time, as people were likely to turn to rival retailers to get what they want."The turn in weather means shoppers will be thinking about refreshing their wardrobes and homes," said Ms Berg."It's certainly not an ideal time to suspend online orders."Catherine Shuttleworth, from Savvy Marketing, said the online impact "is very quick and immediate"."Given the 'buy it now' culture other retailers will benefit from this opportunity."M&S's sales and profits have improved in recent years and it has been seeking to expand its online operations.Last year, out of £3.9bn of sales in its clothing and home business, nearly £1.3bn came online.In September, it said increasing the percentage of online sales was "a critical objective".Ms Berg said problems caused by the cyber attack were "an operational catastrophe"."M&S is firing on all cylinders today, but there's no doubt that this is a significant setback".Last week, a spokesperson from the Information Commissioner's Office told the BBC it was "assessing the information provided" after the retailer told it about the incident.The firm previously said on Tuesday it had reported the incident to the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), and the National Crime Agency told the BBC it was working with the NCSC to support the firm.The retailer is the latest major brand to experience significant disruption to its online services in recent months.Morrisons faced huge problems with its Christmas orders last year, while Barclays and Lloyds were both hit by banking outages in the first two months of this year.CompaniesRetailingMarks & SpencerRelatedWho was Brian Thompson, healthcare CEO gunned down in New York?3 days agoUS & CanadaNo global recession despite US tariffs, says IMF17 Apr 2025BusinessIrish wolfhounds join writer's protest on Meta AI 17 Apr 2025EuropeMore2 days agoM&S stops online orders and issues refunds after cyber attackThe firm has stopped taking orders on its website and apps, including for food and clothes.2 days agoTechnology3 days agoRetail sales see biggest rise for nearly four yearsSales rose for the third month in a row in March as warmer weather helped to boost trade.3 days agoBusiness4 days agoAsda fined £410k for selling out-of-date foodAn investigation by Trading Standards found 58 out of date food items were on shelves in Cornwall.4 days agoCornwall4 days agoHundreds queue as fashion giant opens in citySome people were waiting as early as 06:00 BST as the Japanese retailer opened a store in Liverpool.4 days agoLiverpool4 days agoShein and Temu tax-free parcels rule under reviewRetailers argue that cheap foreign rivals are undercutting business using a tax-free status on small parcels.4 days agoBusinessBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.
