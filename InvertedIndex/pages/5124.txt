"We want to move here and we want to be part of Hyndburn's future."Mr Marsden said the existing Blackburn store was not fit for purpose and the proposed food hall would protect its current 75 staff 's employment as part of bringing 120 jobs to the new development.The meeting unanimously voted for a proposal from the authority's growth boss, councillor Scott Brerton, which approved the application on the grounds that there was no preferable site for the M&S store nearby and the economic benefits it would bring to the borough.He echoed Rishton ward's councillor Kate Walsh's reason for granting planning permission that "we need to be backers not blockers".Matthew Wyatt from PWA planning on behalf of Monte Blackburn, the property arm of Mohsin and Zuber Issa's business empire, told the meeting: "The site is currently a car park for the Hampton by Hilton Hotel. "This is not the loss of active, productive employment land."The financial viability appraisal by Savills, who are well reputed and and experienced advisors, demonstrates the non-viability of the Morrison's site."He added it would add "real opportunities, real livelihoods and real growth for Hyndburn", the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.Listen to the best of BBC Radio Lancashire on BBC Sounds and follow BBC Lancashire on Facebook, X and Instagram and watch BBC North West Tonight on BBC iPlayer.More on this storyNew Marks & Spencer food hall to be debated againPlans revived for new Marks & Spencer food hallIssa brothers' bid to overturn planning refusalBlackburnMarks & SpencerRelatedGiant 50m Ferris wheel to visit town centre1 day agoLancashireChildren's services show 'significant improvement'5 days agoLancashireAbuser drugged girl and took naked photos of her5 days agoLancashireMore21 hrs agoM&S online disruption a 'bruise' to reputation, analyst saysOnline orders have been paused on the retail giant's website and app since Friday. 21 hrs agoBusiness2 days agoM&S stops online orders and issues refunds after cyber attackThe firm has stopped taking orders on its website and apps, including for food and clothes.2 days agoTechnology6 days agoCyber attack on M&S leads to click and collect delaysAngry customers have also complained of being unable to use vouchers and gift cards.6 days agoTechnology11 Apr 2025What's next for former M&S building?Feasibility studies are under way, with the council intending to keep the frontage "intact".11 Apr 2025Wear10 Apr 2025Plans for new Marks & Spencer food hall approvedM&S says it has been looking to open in the town for some time. 10 Apr 2025SuffolkBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.
