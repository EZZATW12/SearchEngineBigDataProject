London Skate Mums meet once a month, and the club welcomes members whose ages range from 30 to 60.Jules Kurzeja, 64, has been told by people she is "too old for skating" - and she said being with the group gives her more confidence.She said: "Sometimes I go to the park alone, and it's just me and 16 teenage boys. I'm used to it now, but when you're starting out, it helps to have peers."The group meets at skate parks across the capital, combining their sessions with coaching from a London skate school. They hope their International Women's Day event will encourage more women to try skateboarding. Looking ahead, they hope to expand, with the ultimate goal of securing their own indoor space.Video by Sian Wright and Eric AndersonFollow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
