The Department for Health and Social Care said that hospitals were "feeling the strain" but that it was taking "decisive action" to prevent winter crises.The Health Foundation report on the recent winter says that the number of people waiting 12 hours or more in A&E after a decision to admit to a ward was the highest since modern records began. It topped 60,000 in January, or 11% of emergency admissions.The report says that a familiar problem remains as acute as ever – delays discharging patients from hospital who are fit to leave. This, it says, made bottlenecks worse in A&E and for ambulances trying to hand over patients and that delays for those handovers were worse than in previous winters.Exhausted hospital staff putting patients at risk, says watchdogPlan for GPs to keep millions out of hospitalWinter pressure bad as height of pandemic, NHS saysThe authors acknowledge that flu cases in hospitals were higher than usual but no worse than in the winter of 2022-23 – though the number took longer to fall than in that year.Hospital patients with the winter vomiting bug norovirus were also more numerous than in many winters.But hospital admissions for the respiratory virus RSV were similar to previous winters, and Covid admissions remained relatively low. Overall emergency hospital admissions fell slightly compared to the previous winter, as did the number of people going into major A&E units.The authors argue that the NHS should be prepared for winters like this one and that blaming external factors such as winter bugs risked offering "false comfort" about the state of the health service.Tim Gardner, assistant director at the Health Foundation, said an annual winter crisis did not have to be inevitable and the analysis should be a "wake up call to the government to focus on the underlying issues".PA MediaA Department for Health and Social Care spokesperson said: "Despite our actions to protect patients during the colder months, including vaccinating more people than last winter, we know hospitals are feeling the strain."Annual winter pressures should not automatically lead to an annual winter crisis." It says its "decisive action" included ending the junior doctors' strikes and rolling out the country's first RSV vaccine.The Royal College of Emergency Medicine said in response to the report there was a "clear roadmap" and that the urgent and emergency care plan and a 10-year plan for the NHS, which are both due soon, offered "an unmissable opportunity to implement changes that are so desperately needed".In a separate move the Department of Health and Social Care said a target for increasing the number of hospitals in England allowing patients to view appointments through the NHS app had been exceeded. The target was 85% by March and the outcome was 87%, up from 68% last July, it said.The department also said because more patients could get access to correspondence via the app, 12 million fewer letters had been sent since July. There were 1.5 million fewer missed appointments, it said. Ministers said this was helping cut waiting lists and saving taxpayers money.Inside the Royal Free - what it tells us about the NHSClive Myrie: What I saw during my 24 hours at a London hospitalSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond.HealthcareNHSRelatedEngland's first mental health inquiry to resume4 hrs agoEssexManx Care mandate: 'We need to make it clearer'4 hrs agoIsle of ManWhat is the Lampard Inquiry and what could it change?4 hrs agoEssexMore36 mins agoMinisters face above projected teacher and NHS pay dealsPay review bodies recommend increases for teachers and NHS workers above the 2.8% the government has budgeted for.36 mins ago4 hrs agoGreen project funding for Devon NHS sitesDevon Partnership NHS Trust says the projects will allow money to be diverted into patient care.4 hrs agoDevon19 hrs agoThe Lightning Seeds to headline Sussex NHS gig  Ian Broudie and his band are raising money for seven hospitals across Sussex. 19 hrs agoSussex20 hrs agoHospital awaiting rebuild marks 60th birthdayArchive photos are released to mark the 60th anniversary since the hospital was officially opened.20 hrs agoEssex1 day agoHospital garden to provide sanctuary for patientsThe garden at Pilgrim Hospital was created by United Lincolnshire Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust.1 day agoLincolnshireBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.
