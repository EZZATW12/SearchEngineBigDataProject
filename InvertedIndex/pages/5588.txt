A statement issued on behalf of the family last week said: “We are shattered to hear about the senseless killing of our beloved Brian."Brian was an incredibly loving, generous, talented man who truly lived life to the fullest and touched so many lives."

"Brian was a highly respected colleague and friend to all who worked with him," the company said in statement.
