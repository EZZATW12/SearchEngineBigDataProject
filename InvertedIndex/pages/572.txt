In addition, we firmly call for such incidents not to be repeated."Georgiev also stressed that the protection of the humanitarian workers was "of paramount importance".The incident, which also seriously injured five other UN personnel, came a day after Israel renewed its offensive against Hamas after a two-month ceasefire collapsed.At the time, UN Secretary General António Guterres called for a full investigation into the incident, while a spokesperson said: "The locations of all UN premises are known to the parties to the conflict, who are bound by international law to protect them and maintain their absolute inviolability."Following the attack, the UN Office for Project Services (UNOPS) said that "explosive ordnance was dropped or fired" at a guesthouse, which was in an "isolated" location. Its executive director, Jorge Moreira da Silva, said it was "not an accident".The IDF said in a statement on the day of the attack: "Contrary to reports, the IDF did not strike a UN compound in Deir al-Balah. The IDF calls on media outlets to act with caution regarding unverified reports."Footage verified by the BBC showed injured people - two wearing blue UN flak jackets - arriving at a hospital in an ambulance and a UN car.Anti-Hamas protests on rise in Gaza as group's iron grip slipsGaza health ministry denies manipulating death toll figuresRed Cross outraged over killing of medics by Israeli forces in GazaSeparately, the IDF said earlier this week that "professional failures" had led to the killing of 15 emergency workers in an incident in Gaza last month.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says at least 1,978 people have been killed since Israel renewed its offensive on the territory, with at least 50 reported killed by Israeli strikes on Thursday.Israel says it is putting military pressure on Hamas to release the 59 hostages it is still holding, 24 of whom are believed to be alive. It has also blocked all deliveries of humanitarian aid and other supplies to Gaza for seven weeks. The UN says this is "further depriving people of the means for survival and undermining every aspect of civilian life".The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.More than 51,300 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.Middle EastIsrael-Gaza warIsraelUnited NationsBulgariaRelatedDozens killed in US strike on Yemen migrant centre, Houthis say25 mins agoWorldMourning turns to anger in Iran after massive port explosion kills 4015 hrs agoMiddle EastHuge blast at key Iranian port kills 28 and injures 80022 hrs agoMiddle EastMore12 hrs agoIsrael launches air strike on BeirutIsrael said it hit a Hezbollah missile store.
