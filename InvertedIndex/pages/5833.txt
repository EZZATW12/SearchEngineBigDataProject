"The board will then review and consider this business case during the summer months, with the aim of making a well-informed decision about the proposed recommendations."Follow Essex news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.More on this storyTrust pauses hospital closure plan after backlashConsultation on hospital closure plan extendedInside the hospital deemed 'not fit for purpose'NHS will consider closing community hospitalRelated internet linksMid and South Essex NHS Foundation TrustMid and South Essex NHS Foundation TrustHealthNHSMaldonRelatedNew app first in UK for cardiac arrest witnesses1 day agoEnglandNew room to enable 3,000 extra procedures - trust5 Apr 2025EssexHospitals using AI to predict patient outcomes14 Mar 2025EssexMore28 mins agoMinisters face above projected teacher and NHS pay dealsPay review bodies recommend increases for teachers and NHS workers above the 2.8% the government has budgeted for.28 mins agoPolitics46 mins agoWhat your earwax can reveal about your healthEarwax can contain valuable indicators to a person's health.
