the people in mental health units died.Melanie Leahy, whose 20-year-old son Matthew died under NHS care, said: "It's been years of heartbreak, unanswered questions and fighting just to be heard."The inquiry has been arranged to focus on the work by Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust (EPUT), the North East London Foundation Trust (NELFT) and organisations that existed previously.EPUT chief executive Paul Scott has apologised for deaths under his trust's care.Melanie LeahyMelanie Leahy said the facility Matthew died in was "hell on earth"Focus is being shifted to

investigating reports of wrongdoing.The inquiry heard impact statements from about 80 family witnesses across two phases in September and November.Baroness Lampard previously warned "we may never be

resumption was a "pivotal moment"."We must hold a mirror up to our mental health services and face the grave reality that our clients have suffered and are continuing to suffer," she said.Evidence is due to continue until 15 May.Mr Scott said: "As the inquiry progresses, there will be many accounts of people who were much loved and missed over the past 24 years and I want to say how sorry I am for their loss."All of us across healthcare have a responsibility to work together to improve care and treatment for all, and to build on the improvements that have already been made over the last 24 years."Follow Essex news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.More on this story'I have lost all faith and trust in this broken nation'Ex-footballer died after discharge, inquiry toldMum says son
