I didn't expect it."He said he thought he was a "shoo-in" for fifth place until his housemates began "disappearing" on Friday night's show. "I thought, surely not," he said. "When JoJo went my head fell off - I had her nailed down as the winner."Reflecting on his love of the show, he added: "I was skipping into the diary room even if they were telling me off - I loved it. I loved the whole thing."Getty ImagesJack P Shepherd has said he wants to stay on Corrie for another 25 yearsThis year's series made headlines when Hollywood actor Mickey Rourke was unveiled as one of the housemates when it began three weeks ago - before being kicked out for "inappropriate language" and "unacceptable behaviour".The Oscar-nominated actor had been given a warning after Siwa accused him of being "homophobic", before being removed after a confrontation with former Love Island star Hughes. Hughes and former Dance Moms star Siwa, 21, formed a close friendship on the show. She also made waves when she said being in the house had made her decide to identify as queer instead of lesbian."I'm switching letters!" she told Beard, joking that she was moving from the L to the Q in LGBTQ."I've always told myself I'm a lesbian, and I think being here I've realised, 'Oh, I'm not a lesbian, I'm queer.' And I think that's really cool".Viewers' favouriteThe celebrities who were voted out over the course of the series included TV host Trisha Goddard, athlete Daley Thompson and EastEnders icon Patsy Palmer.Also on the line-up were former MP Michael Fabricant, presenter Angellica Bell and The Only Way Is Essex's Ella Rae Wise.But it was Shepherd who emerged as the viewers' favourite.The 37-year-old has been a fixture on screen as Gail's son David since 2000, when he was 12. There has been speculation about his future on the show, but he has said he wants to stay for another 25 years.This was the second celebrity edition of Big Brother on ITV since the broadcaster revived the show in 2023. The launch episode earlier this month was watched by about 2.7 million people.Rourke leaves Big Brother after 'unacceptable behaviour'Former MP paid 'six figures' for Big Brother stintCorrie legend, social star and an Oscar nominee: Celebrity Big Brother kicks offCoronation StreetTelevisionCelebrity Big BrotherRelatedOriginal Coronation Street star Philip Lowrie dies2 days agoManchesterEx-Coronation Street star's film released online30 Mar 2025EnglandTributes paid to actress and BBC presenter 4 Mar 2025EnglandMore17 hrs agoGlow Up is back, and Thunderbolts* hits cinemas: What's coming up this weekAnother Simple Favour is also coming out, while Samantha Crain drops her new album.17 hrs agoCulture18 hrs agoDrag Race and Pose star Jiggly Caliente dies aged 44The drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a "severe infection", her family says.18 hrs agoWorld2 days agoWallace seeks 'space to heal' after saying claims against him 'not all true'Wallace stepped away from presenting MasterChef last November in the wake of the claims against him.2 days agoCulture3 days agoUK Eurovision act recreate spoof song, as contest loomsRemember Monday travelled to Iceland to film a cover of My Hometown, from Netflix's Fire Saga movie.3 days agoCulture3 days agoTom Hardy Netflix thriller 'puts Wales on world map'Although Havoc set in an unnamed US city, all of it was filmed in Wales.3 days agoWalesBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.
