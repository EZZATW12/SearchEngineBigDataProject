It posted graphic footage showing multiple bodies covered in the rubble of a destroyed building.There was no immediate comment from the US military.But it came hours after US Central Command announced that its forces had hit more than 800 targets since President Donald Trump ordered an intensification of the air campaign against the Houthis on 15 March.It said the strikes had "killed hundreds of Houthi fighters and numerous Houthi leaders", including senior officials overseeing missile and drone programmes.Houthi-run authorities have said the strikes have killed dozens of civilians, but they have reported few casualties among the group's members.The migrant detention centre in Saada was reportedly holding 115 Africans when it was hit on Sunday night.Despite the humanitarian crisis in Yemen caused by 11 years of conflict, migrants continue to arrive in the country by boat from the Horn of Africa, most of them intending to cross into neighbouring Saudi Arabia to find work.Instead, they face exploitation, detention, violence, and dangerous journeys through active conflict zones, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM).In 2024 alone, it says, almost 60,900 migrants arrived in the country, often with no means to survive.Earlier this month, the Houthi-run government said a series of US air strikes on the Ras Isa oil terminal on the Red Sea coast killed at least 74 people and wounded 171 others. It said the terminal was a civilian facility and that the strikes constituted a "war crime".Centcom said the attack destroyed the ability of Ras Isa to accept fuel and that it would "begin to impact Houthi ability to not only conduct operations, but also to generate millions of dollars in revenue for their terror activities".Who are the Houthis and why is the US targeting them?Hundreds of migrants killed by Saudi border guards - report'We make it or we die'Last month, Trump ordered large-scale strikes on areas controlled by the Houthis and threatened that they would be "completely annihilated". He has also warned Iran not to arm the group - something it has repeatedly denied doing.On Sunday, Centcom said it would "continue to ratchet up the pressure until the objective is met, which remains the restoration of freedom of navigation and American deterrence in the region".Since November 2023, the Houthis have targeted dozens of merchant vessels with missiles, drones and small boat attacks in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. They have sunk two vessels, seized a third, and killed four crew members.The Houthis have said they are acting in support of the Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, and have claimed - often falsely - that they are targeting ships only linked to Israel, the US or the UK.The Houthis were not deterred by the deployment of Western warships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden to protect merchant vessels last year, or by multiple rounds of US strikes on military targets ordered by former President Joe Biden.After taking office in January, Trump redesignated the Houthis as a "Foreign Terrorist Organisation" - a status the Biden administration had removed due to what it said was the need to mitigate the country's humanitarian crisis.Over the last decade, Yemen has been devastated by a civil war, which escalated when the Houthis seized control of the country's north-west from the internationally-recognised government, and a Saudi-led coalition supported by the US intervened in an effort to restore its rule.The fighting has reportedly left more than 150,000 people dead and triggered a humanitarian disaster, with 4.8 million people displaced and 19.5 million - half of the population - in need of some form of aid.Middle EastYemenHouthis United StatesRelatedMourning turns to anger in Iran after massive port explosion kills 4018 hrs agoMiddle EastHuge blast at key Iranian port kills 28 and injures 80024 hrs agoMiddle EastIsraeli military admits its troops killed UN worker in Gaza Strip3 days agoWorldMore40 mins agoOne dead and multiple injured after hit-and-run boat crash in Florida The Clearwater Ferry, which had 45 people on board, was struck by a boat which then fled the scene.40 mins agoUS & Canada1 hr agoCritical week for US's future in Ukraine-Russia talks, Rubio saysIt is a "very critical" week for the White House and its involvement, Secretary of State Marco Rubio tells US media.1 hr agoWorld6 hrs agoCanada votes in pivotal election transformed by TrumpThe US president came to dominate on the campaign trail, with the contest being viewed as a referendum on how Canada should engage with him.6 hrs agoUS & Canada10 hrs agoThe rapid remaking of a nation, in 100 daysThe impact of what President Trump has done so far is being felt in every corner of American life.10 hrs agoUS & Canada18 hrs agoDrag Race and Pose star Jiggly Caliente dies aged 44The drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a "severe infection", her family says.18 hrs agoWorldBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.
