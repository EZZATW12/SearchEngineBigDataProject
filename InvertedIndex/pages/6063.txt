He was a warm, approachable uncle, and I loved him deeply."José Ignacio vividly remembers the day his uncle was elected pope, a moment that stunned him, especially after he had dismissed all speculation that Jorge could ascend to the papacy."I had gone to a family friend's house for a meal, and we began watching the conclave. The moment the white smoke rose, I started to tremble. I became incredibly nervous," he said.You can watch and follow the funeral live here on the BBC News website and app. In the UK, there will be live coverage on BBC One from 0830-1230 BST, presented by Reeta Chakrabarti, available to watch on the iPlayer.

Finally, you can also follow coverage of the funeral on the BBC World Service"Then, the protodeacon stepped out and announced, 'Habemus Papam.' I only heard 'Giorgio Mario.' I dropped to my knees in front of the television and started to cry."The short journey to share the news with his mother, who lived just 15 blocks away, took much longer than usual. Everywhere he went, locals stopped him to offer their congratulations."At home, I hugged my mother, and we cried together for a while. Then cousins and friends started to arrive, and the phone was ringing off the hook."Amid the chaos, with local and international media camped outside their door, the phone rang again around 9pm. A distant voice on the other end simply said, 'Hello.'"Who am I speaking to," I asked. "It's Jorge, boludo," came the reply [using the rude slang Argentines use for "idiot", often affectionately]. "It was Pope Francis, swearing," José Ignacio recalled. "I handed the phone to mum. As they spoke, I watched her tears dry. It was an incredibly moving moment."Powerful messageGetty ImagesWhen Jorge Mario Bergoglio became Pope in 2013, it surprised much of the worldHundreds of thousands are expected to gather in St. Peter's Square on Saturday for Pope Francis's funeral, including world leaders, Catholic officials, and mourners from around the globe.However, José Ignacio said his family had no plans to travel to Rome for the service."We firmly believe our place is here," he explained, encouraging mourners to honour Pope Francis's memory by donating to charity, a gesture he believed would be a more meaningful tribute.José Ignacio had shared the news of his wife's pregnancy with the Pope during their last conversation, a moment that would remain etched in his memory forever."The joy and emotion he expressed were deeply meaningful to me," he said, adding that Pope Francis left him with a powerful message to live a life of solidarity, austerity, humility and commitment.He also remembered a conversation from his teenage years when his uncle was a cardinal, recalling it as the best advice he ever received on how to make the world a better place."Change comes from within, through commitment," his uncle had told him."If you're unhappy with the police, become a policeman and change it from within. If you're dissatisfied with politics, get involved in politics. With commitment and conviction, we can create a better world,' he said."I think this is one of the most profound lessons I've learned from him."Family & EducationCatholicismCultureArgentinaPope FrancisRoman Catholic ChurchReligionRelatedLittle ones learn recipe for simple, healthy meals6 days agoBeds, Herts & BucksDiscovery of lost camera sparks appeal for owner15 Apr 2025CornwallCharities criticise 'distressing' cuts to adoption fund15 Apr 2025PoliticsMore4 hrs agoFaith groups canvassed on new organ donation lawFaith groups are invited to a 2 May meeting to discuss the switch to an "opt-out" organ donation law.4 hrs agoIsle of Man17 hrs agoGlow Up is back, and Thunderbolts* hits cinemas: What's coming up this weekAnother Simple Favour is also coming out, while Samantha Crain drops her new album.17 hrs agoCulture19 hrs agoPope Francis wanted to 'create a more fraternal world'The Bishop of Portsmouth pays tribute, saying there was "something very human about Francis".19 hrs agoEngland20 hrs agoBristol in Pictures: The Manics rock the BeaconOur weekly round-up includes Rovers, St George's Day, The Manics and the Christmas Steps.20 hrs agoEngland22 hrs agoEnd conflict to honour Pope, Vatican diplomat tells South SudanThe Vatican's representative to South Sudan says the Pope's memory should be honoured by seeking peace.22 hrs agoAfricaBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.
