Brangwyn Hall, SwanseaGetty ImagesConcert venue Swansea's Brangwyn Hall was one of Havoc's filming locations Swansea's Brangwyn Hall doubled up as the exterior of a fictional city police station.Inside the concert venue, which was built in 1934, the stairwell was also used for filming as part of the film's gala hall.Evans revealed the film's interior police station scenes were actually shot at the Pierhead building in Cardiff Bay."I think we weren't popular when we did that because it was in the middle of half-term week," said Evans."So we had to shut down the fair for two days, so for any mums and dads and kids - I'm very sorry."2. Bute Street, CardiffNeil RaymentBute Street in Cardiff was transformed into a busy US city street, complete with metal staircasesCardiff's Bute Street was turned into a US boulevard with 30cm (12in) of fake snow for one of Havoc's night-time scenes.Neil Rayment, a goldsmith whose business on Bute Street became part of the set, described how the production team built a fake metal stairway in front of his shop before filming began."They came and constructed this amazing thing," said Mr Rayment. "I've been to New York and it looked like that very sort of iconic steel structure walkway... quite dark, quite industrial, and they'd literally built three storeys of that all up the outside of the front of a building."He said the front of his shop was also covered with the fake snow."Every time we'd bring down the shutter for the next three months after they'd wrapped we'd have like little bits of snowflakes falling at the front of the shutter."Mr Rayment also made some of the detective badges used as props in the show.Neil RaymentMr Rayment created some of the detective badges used as props on the show"They have certain pieces that have to be really authentic. They're called the hero pieces because they're in close-up," he said."Then we had some action ones that had to be quite flexible, to make sure they put up with a bit of fighting, because there's always action isn't there when Tom Hardy's involved."3. Swansea University's Bay CampusNetflixSwansea University's Bay Campus was transformed into a busy city street, with the help of some visual effectsA key scene in the film is when Forest Whitaker's character is waiting in gridlocked traffic.This was shot at Swansea University's Bay Campus, with added visual effects applied after filming.4. Trade Street, CardiffGoogleTrade Street became the basis for the film's Chinatown locationTrade Street, just behind Cardiff Central Station, was used for exterior shots of Chinatown, a fish market and Wong's Alley."We came up with a Chinatown and I didn't want it to feel like the Chinatowns you see in western cities like London," said Evans."Let's take a look at the old-walled city vibe. We went a little mythic in our world-build."5. The fishing shackNetflixThe fishing shack scene required six weeks of night shoots, according to NetflixThe film's fishing shack location was filmed in multiple parts of Wales. Some interior shots were filmed at the Swansea University Bay Campus.Other exterior shots were filmed at Dragon Studios in Bridgend. But the third and final iteration of the shack, used for dramatic scenes, was built in Candleston Woods in Merthyr Mawr, Bridgend.6. Baglan train stationThere are no spoilers here but Havoc's climax - filmed on train tracks - was actually shot at Baglan railway station in Neath Port Talbot.The film's producer, Ed Talfan, said Evans had "always wanted this final, gigantic set piece in the fishing shack and on the railway sidings"."I don't think there's any limit to the scale of projects that can come to Wales and hopefully it's the first of many," he added.Will Wales' filming locations bring more visitors?Burton's journey from mining village to HollywoodWalesBaglanBridgendSwanseaCardiffFilmNetflixTom HardyRelatedThe never-ending juggle of managing school admin4 hrs agoWalesWales' papers: City fans call for Tan talks and Wrexham promoted5 hrs agoWalesStruggling students skip meals as living costs rise5 hrs agoWalesMore1 hr agoNew film set to attract 'more tourists' to areaThe film showcases Minehead, Porlock and other locations along the Exmoor Coast. 1 hr agoSomerset13 hrs agoMan charged with murder of woman Police have charged a 56-year-old man with the murder of Tracey Davies. 13 hrs agoWales17 hrs agoGlow Up is back, and Thunderbolts* hits cinemas: What's coming up this weekAnother Simple Favour is also coming out, while Samantha Crain drops her new album.17 hrs agoCulture23 hrs agoGinger Mr Darcy will break barriers, jokes LowdenThe Slow Horses actor recently signed up for a Netflix adaptation of Jane Austen's classic novel.23 hrs agoCulture1 day agoWho's in, who's out? - the URC's dramatic play-off raceBBC Sport takes a look at the state of play in the United Rugby Championship, where 10 teams are battling for the final four play-off positions.1 day agoRugby UnionBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.
