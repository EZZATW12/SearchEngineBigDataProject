He said recreating the US in south Wales was "challenging" but he wanted to bring work to the area."I started going around, like, Swansea, Port Talbot, Cardiff and Newport, looking for any little bit of architecture that I could find that might pass as a little bit Americana," he said."And so we took a look and we thought if we can get 30% or 40% real in camera then the VFX (visual effects) can take care of the rest."Swansea's Brangwyn Hall became the outside of an American police precinct, Swansea University's Bay campus provided exterior street shots, and a fishing shack was built in the Merthyr Mawr countryside.NetflixJessie Mei Li who previously starred in Netflix's Shadow And Bones shares top billing with Tom HardyAlthough Havoc was made in Wales, US production company XYZ Films joined forces with Wales-based Severn Screen to make it.Aram Tertzakian, one of XYZ Films' founders, has worked with Evans since Apostle, the 2018 horror featuring Michael Sheen which was filmed around Margam Park in Port Talbot.Tertzakian spent much of the pandemic in an Airbnb in Cardiff while Havoc was being filmed."Gareth brought me to Wales for this project because he is a great patriot and wanted to figure out how to make films in Wales," said Tertzakian.He said he believed that after Havoc, filmmakers and producers in the industry are going to be "a lot more focused on Wales being on the map"."I think it's always been seen as an option but when they see Havoc and what we pulled off, I think it's going to blow their minds and really make Wales a lot more viable for a lot of people."Wales is one of the good guys," he added."You've got really hard working crews, a lot of dedication and love for the game. You get some amazing locations, both interiors and exteriors and we had a blast."NetflixThe film was entirely shot and cut in Wales, with some visual effects added in elsewhereAccording to Netflix and Creative Wales, Havoc is the largest feature film ever to be shot entirely in Wales, with post production also completed in Cardiff.Netflix said its productions in Wales, which also include Sex Education, had generated more than £200m for the UK economy since 2020.Jack Sargeant, Wales' minister for culture, said productions like Havoc had delivered "significant economic and reputational benefits"."We are immensely proud of our Welsh creative industries, which employ over 35,000 talented individuals, and the world-class infrastructure we have in place for film and TV productions."Welsh low budget horror film gets global releaseNever say never on Gavin & Stacey film - Larry LambThe teacher who helped to propel Richard Burton to fame BBC Wales journalist stars in new Bridget Jones filmWalesTelevisionPopular cultureSwanseaCardiffFilmNetflixRelatedThe never-ending juggle of managing school admin4 hrs agoWalesWales' papers: City fans call for Tan talks and Wrexham promoted5 hrs agoWalesStruggling students skip meals as living costs rise5 hrs agoWalesMore1 hr agoNew film set to attract 'more tourists' to areaThe film showcases Minehead, Porlock and other locations along the Exmoor Coast. 1 hr agoSomerset17 hrs agoGlow Up is back, and Thunderbolts* hits cinemas: What's coming up this weekAnother Simple Favour is also coming out, while Samantha Crain drops her new album.17 hrs agoCulture18 hrs agoDrag Race and Pose star Jiggly Caliente dies aged 44The drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a "severe infection", her family says.18 hrs agoWorld23 hrs agoGinger Mr Darcy will break barriers, jokes LowdenThe Slow Horses actor recently signed up for a Netflix adaptation of Jane Austen's classic novel.23 hrs agoCulture1 day agoWho's in, who's out? - the URC's dramatic play-off raceBBC Sport takes a look at the state of play in the United Rugby Championship, where 10 teams are battling for the final four play-off positions.1 day agoRugby UnionBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.
