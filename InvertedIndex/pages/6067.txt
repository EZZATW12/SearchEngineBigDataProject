This series follows Wednesday Addams, played by Jenna Ortega, as she returns to Nevermore Academy, now under the leadership of new principal Barry Dort (Buscemi).Also joining the school this term is her little brother Pugsley (Isaac Ordonez), a character described by executive producer Tim Burton as an "outcast among outcasts".Wednesday's parents will also have an increased presence on campus this season - "a rare new form of torture for the fiercely independent amateur sleuth", Netflix said.The first full-length trailer, which was released, appropriately, on Wednesday, opened with the show's lead character going through airport security. As the metal detector beeps, she has to unload a knuckle duster, cattle prod, several knives and Thing - a disembodied hand - from her bag, before a security guard challenges her about the tube of sun cream she is also carrying.NetflixThe trailer sees Wednesday having to unload her weapon-filled bag as she goes through security"Wednesday Addams is one of the coolest characters of all time," Ortega said as the trailer launched."So to have gotten the opportunity to play her once was incredible, and then to be able to slip into the costume and tone again, it's so much fun. "She runs circles around everyone that she has a conversation with, so to play someone who's so much more intelligent than you will ever be, it's quite funny and strange and enjoyable."Lumley 'perfect and hilarious'NetflixBritish actress Joanna Lumley has joined the cast as Hester Frump, Morticia's complex motherVeteran British actress Lumley has joined the cast as Hester Frump, Wednesday's grandmother and closest ally."The first day on set when Joanna walked on, she just was Hester and she nailed every single line, and it's just so delicious," said show creator Miles Millar. "She's perfect and hilarious."Lumley described the Nevermore atmosphere as "intoxicating", adding: "It's wonderful. I get to wear many, many huge wigs, one on top of the other - and lots of quite constraining clothes, so I love it."Buscemi's 'mysterious' principalNetflixFargo and Reservoir Dogs star Steve Buscemi will portray Nevermore's new principal Barry DortMeanwhile, Buscemi described Principal Dort as "a bit of a mysterious figure", adding: "Something about him is not right, but he loves the school and he has real outcast pride."The first series of Wednesday was Netflix's biggest hit to date, and cemented Ortega as a major screen star. She has since appeared in Beetlejuice Beetlejuice, Death of a Unicorn and Scream XI.NetflixWednesday's little brother enrols at Nevermore this season, while her parents have an increased presence on campusIn the trailer, Wednesday's mother Morticia (Catherine Zeta-Jones) notes it's the first time her daughter has returned to school willingly.For her part, Wednesday describes returning to school as "like returning to the scene of the crime", noting that she "already knows where the bodies are buried".Later, the young Addams daughter is seen attending a macarbre tea party for a group of dolls."Wherever there's murder and mayhem," Wednesday reflects, "you will always find an Addams."The trailer's reference to "mayhem" could hint at a previously reported cameo appearance from Lady Gaga, who recently released an album of that name.Netflix will be hoping the series replicates the success of the first. Its decision to split the new season in half is likely due to efforts to retain subscribers, refresh its platform and increase the hype around the show.Netflix's most watched shows ever:WednesdayStranger Things (season four)AdolescenceMonster: The Jeffrey Dahmer StoryBridgerton (season one)The Queen's GambitBridgerton (season three)The Night Agent Fool Me OnceStranger ThingsSource: NetflixAdditional reporting by Ian YoungsWhat Netflix's numbers tell us about viewing habitsWednesday Addams actress Lisa Loring dies at 64TelevisionNetflixRelatedGlow Up is back, and Thunderbolts* hits cinemas: What's coming up this week17 hrs agoCultureDrag Race and Pose star Jiggly Caliente dies aged 4418 hrs agoWorldWallace seeks 'space to heal' after saying claims against him 'not all true'2 days agoCultureMore23 hrs agoGinger Mr Darcy will break barriers, jokes LowdenThe Slow Horses actor recently signed up for a Netflix adaptation of Jane Austen's classic novel.23 hrs agoCulture2 days agoThe Welsh locations transformed for Netflix thrillerAlthough it is set in the US, Netflix's new thriller starring Tom Hardy was filmed across Wales.2 days agoWales3 days agoRetired police dog meets actor Tom HardyThe actor met Bear the dog while filming a promotional video for the new Netflix film, Havoc.3 days ago3 days agoTom Hardy Netflix thriller 'puts Wales on world map'Although Havoc set in an unnamed US city, all of it was filmed in Wales.3 days agoWales7 days agoJohn Cena becomes most decorated WWE wrestler in historyThe wrestler broke the record for most title wins by beating Cody Rhodes at WrestleMania.7 days agoCultureBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.
