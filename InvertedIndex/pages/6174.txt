Kill your local MP."Katie Amess, whose father Sir David Amess was an MP when he was murdered in 2021, said she was "gobsmacked at the stupidity of somebody or a group of people being in the public eye and saying such dangerous, violent rhetoric".Tory Party leader Kemi Badenoch has since called for police prosecution.Kneecap have said on social media that they have "faced a co-ordinated smear campaign".The footage is being assessed by counter-terrorism police.'This demands prosecution'Getty ImagesConservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch says the groups "glorifies terrorism"In a post on social media, Badenoch called for action: "Kneecap's glorification of terrorism and anti-British hatred has no place in our society"."After the murder of Sir David Amess, this demands prosecution," she added.Getty ImagesSir David Amess, who was a Conservative MP for Southend West, died after he was stabbed more than 20 timesMs Amess told BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme that the band's alleged comments were deeply upsetting and hurtful to her and her family."It is just beyond belief that human beings would speak like that in this day and age and it is extremely dangerous," Ms Amess told BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme."To say to kill anybody, what on earth are they thinking?"Ms Amess said there were "absolute nutters" who could try to act upon the comments allegedly made by Kneecap.Sir David, who represented Southend West in the House of Commons, was stabbed to death by Ali Harbi Ali, a fanatic of so-called Islamic State, at a constituency surgery on 15 October 2021.The Metropolitan Police also said another video, from November 2024, was being assessed.The footage appeared to show a Kneecap band member shouting "up Hamas, up Hezbollah" at a performance in London.Both Hamas and Hezbollah, are banned in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them.A Met Police spokesperson said: "We were made aware of a video on 22 April, believed to be from an event in November 2024, and it has been referred to the Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit (CTIRU) for assessment and to determine whether any further police investigation may be required."We have also been made aware of another video believed to be from an event in November 2023."Getty ImagesKneecap say they have "faced a co-ordinated smear campaign"Ms Amess said Kneecap should contact her and apologise to her "and every other person that has been offended by this".She said the band should take a "long hard look in the mirror and realise that my family and my life has been destroyed, I will never ever be the same again and we lost a wonderful man, a wonderful parliamentarian and they could only hope to be as good a person as he is"."I think when they hear these words from me, they are going to realise the pain and the torment, it has just ruined my life and my family's life," she said."I have hope, I think that they are going to say sorry, they didn't think it through and maybe they can work with people to educate them and change the minds of their fans, because I am sure this incited their fans to think of evil and violence and abhorrent things."'Hopefully they just made a mistake'Ms Amess said she would be prepared to meet Kneecap and have a conversation with them."If they are willing to listen to how my life has been obliterated and will never be the same, for them to say those words is obviously very triggering," she said."I'm sure deep down they are nice people, hopefully they just made a mistake and are going to apologise for it."A government spokesman said: "We unequivocally condemn threatening remarks made towards any individual."Political intimidation and abuse must have no place in our society. We recognise the chilling effect that harassment and intimidation of elected representatives can have on our democracy."All reports of intimidation, harassment and threats are taken extremely seriously. We work with the police and Parliament to do everything in our power to crack down on threats to elected officials."Democratic Unionist Party leader Gavin Robinson called for Kneecap to be investigated."Promoting sectarianism, glorifying violence and spreading division under the guise of "art" is still hate," the Belfast East MP said in a post on X.None of the members of the group have been charged with any offences.Sharon Osborne criticismThe group has faced recent criticism after they displayed messages about the war in Gaza during their set at US music festival Coachella earlier this month.Following former X Factor judge Sharon Osbourne calling for Kneecap's US work visas to be revoked, the band was dropped by its now-former sponsor and booking agent Independent Artist Group (IAG). The agency confirmed the split to The Hollywood Reporter.Kneecap hit back at the visa call, and when asked by BBC News NI for a response, the band replied: "Statements aren't aggressive, murdering 20,000 children is though."The visas held by the band members are understood to no longer be valid and they are in the process of securing a new sponsor ahead of its sellout October tour in North America.Kneecap, made up of Liam Og Ó Hannaidh, Naoise Ó Caireallain and JJ Ó Dochartaigh, alleged on social media they have "faced a co-ordinated smear campaign", saying their shows have previously "called out" the conflict in Gaza.They also appeared to suggest they would be taking legal action against the "malicious efforts".Earlier in the week, Kneecap's manager Daniel Lambert said the band had received "severe" death threats after Coachella.Kneecap 'kill MP' footage being assessed by policeKneecap say statement at Coachella 'not aggressive' after criticismCall for Kneecap's US visas to be revoked after CoachellaGovernment rejects call for inquiry into MP murderBelfastDavid AmessMetropolitan Police ServiceNorthern IrelandRelatedAirbus confirms deal for Spirit operations in Belfast3 hrs agoNorthern IrelandMan in hospital after crash between car and bike13 hrs agoNorthern IrelandNI Liverpool fans ready for 'extra special' day2 days agoNorthern IrelandMore2 hrs agoEx-Irish police officer  'honoured' to lead Disappeared investigationMr Henry's appointment marks the first time someone from An Garda Síochána has taken the role. 2 hrs agoNorthern Ireland4 hrs ago'Trailblazer' honoured with Blue PlaqueMay Hezlet, from Aghadowey, won her first golf competition at the age of 11. 4 hrs agoNorthern Ireland11 hrs agoKneecap 'kill MP' footage being assessed by policeVideo has emerged of a gig in 2023 appearing to show one band member saying: "The only good Tory is a dead Tory."11 hrs agoNorthern Ireland19 hrs agoArrests over paint thrown on London Marathon routeThe protesters were arrested and the London Marathon continued uninterrupted across Tower Bridge.19 hrs agoLondon20 hrs agoArrest after man dies in Twickenham stabbingPolice were called to Ellerman Avenue in Twickenham on Saturday night and found an injured man.20 hrs agoLondonBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.
