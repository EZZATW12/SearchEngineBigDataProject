The nominations are voted on by more than 1,200 music historians, industry professionals and previously inducted artists.The full list of performers to be inducted this year is:Bad CompanyChubby CheckerJoe CockerCyndi LauperOutkastSoundgardenThe White StripesSalt-N-Pepa, the first commercially successful female rap group, will also receive the musical influence award, alongside Warren Zevon - a cult singer-songwriter who was revered by Bruce Springsteen and Bob Dylan.The induction ceremony will take place in Los Angeles on 8 November, and will be streamed live on Disney+.Getty ImagesMariah Carey and Oasis both lost out on a place in the Hall of Fame, despite two nominations in separate years"Each of these inductees created their own sound and attitude that had a profound impact on culture and helped to change the course of Rock & Roll forever," said the Hall of Fame's chairman John Sykes. "Their music gave a voice to generations and influenced countless artists that followed in their footsteps."However, equal amounts of attention will be paid to the artists who didn't make it into the hallowed hall, which encompasses all genres of popular music.Mariah Carey's omission, in particular, will be seen as an egregious oversight. With 19 US number one singles, she is second only to The Beatles in terms of chart success. Her self-titled debut album spent 11 weeks at the top of the Billboard chart in 1990, and her Christmas classic, All I Want For Christmas Is You, is the 11th best-selling single of all time.This is the second time she has been overlooked by the Rock Hall's voters. Asked for her thoughts on being snubbed last year, Carey said: "My thoughts are, I didn't get in."A second snub will embolden critics who say the Hall of Fame has a poor record of admitting women.Lauper, who did make it through the voting process, was the only other woman on this year's main ballot.Getty ImagesChubby Checker waged a long campaign to win his induction to the Hall of FameOasis were also passed over for a second time, having been nominated in 2024. But singer Liam Gallagher has previously criticised the institution, saying he wasn't interested in receiving an award from "some geriatric in a cowboy hat".Veteran jam band Phish also missed out on a place - despite winning a fan vote that counted towards this year's ceremony.However, losing a nomination doesn't mean an artist is disqualified from future ceremonies. Nile Rodgers and Chic famously had to sit through 11 nominations before they were finally inducted in 2017.Chubby protestA similar story emerges this year for Checker, whose song The Twist became a global phenomenon in 1960.The star, now 83, was ignored by the Rock Hall for years, even as contemporaries like Sam Cooke, Bill Haley, Wilson Pickett and Fats Domino were admitted.In 2001, Checker took out a full-page ad in Billboard magazine calling on the Rock Hall to recognise him for the song that, he said, became "the biggest dance of the century"."I want my flowers while I'm alive," he wrote. "I can't smell them when I'm dead."Demanding a statue in the courtyard of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, he added: "I will not have the music business ignore my position in the industry."That wish has finally been granted.Getty ImagesThe White Stripes were inducted on their first nominationThis year's other inductees include Outkast - aka André 3000 and Big Boi.Known for hits like Ms Jackson, Rosa Parks and Hey Ya!, their swampy Southern rhythms and bohemian take on hip-hop changed the sound of the genre in the late 1990s and early 2000s.Soundgarden, best known for grunge anthem Black Hole Sun, have also earned a place; as have The White Stripes - the garage rock band formed by Jack and Meg White in 1997, whose hits include Seven Nation Army, Hotel Yorba and Fell In Love With A Girl.Fans will speculate about whether Meg, who hasn't been seen in public since 2009, will attend the induction ceremony.There are also musical excellence awards for Thom Bell, an architect of the Philadelphia Soul sound, and English pianist Nicky Hopkins, who contributed to records by The Rolling Stones, The Beatles and The Who.US guitarist Carol Kaye, whose fretwork can be heard on classic tracks like You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling and the theme to Mission: Impossible, receives the same honour.Finally, record executive Lenny Waronker, who helped develop acts like Madonna, REM and Prince, will receive the Ahmet Ertegun award, given to non-performers who have had a major influence on rock music.Oasis nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of FameOzzy inducted into Rock and Roll Hall of FameMariah CareyOasisMusicRelatedNatalie Imbruglia and Will Young to sing at Pride25 Mar 2025SussexMariah Carey wins copyright case over Christmas hit20 Mar 2025CultureMariah Carey to perform at royal estate24 Feb 2025NorfolkMore3 hrs agoRadiohead reimagined with classical twist in home cityLondon Concertante's Radiohead Reimagined plays Christ Church Cathedral in Oxford.3 hrs agoOxfordshire10 hrs agoKneecap 'kill MP' footage being assessed by policeVideo has emerged of a gig in 2023 appearing to show one band member saying: "The only good Tory is a dead Tory."10 hrs agoNorthern Ireland15 hrs agoGlow Up is back, and Thunderbolts* hits cinemas: What's coming up this weekAnother Simple Favour is also coming out, while Samantha Crain drops her new album.15 hrs agoCulture18 hrs agoThe Lightning Seeds to headline Sussex NHS gig  Ian Broudie and his band are raising money for seven hospitals across Sussex. 18 hrs agoSussex22 hrs agoWales still inspires work of Stereophonics front manKelly Jones, from Cwmaman, now lives in London, but makes regular trips back to Wales.22 hrs agoWalesBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.
