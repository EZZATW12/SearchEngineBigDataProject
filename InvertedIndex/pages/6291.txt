"If you think over 125 years what that tin has been through - there's been several world wars, it's probably travelled back and forth over the Atlantic a couple of times."He said the chocolate bar, which is valued between £250 and £400, appealed to bidders who "might want an important piece of social history" or just a "talking point at a dinner party"."It also appeals to militaria collectors, so it actually has quite a broad appeal," he added.Follow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.
