Upcoming productions include an art exhibition at the prestigious Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, and a stage show at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford Upon Avon that will combine the Bard's Hamlet with their Hail to the Thief album.London ConcertanteThe Radiohead Reimagined tour is being performed at cathedrals and abbeys across the UKGrist believes that a former "perceived snobbery" in the art and classical world is "evaporating", as the opportunities rock music can bring become evident."[This] can be a starting point for the listener to then explore further the world of classical music, and that's certainly our aim whilst we're creating this show," he says."There is such a line that goes through from the great masters to great rock music, and the way that we've approached it is to not dumb down anything about the music that we're presenting. "So for a Radiohead fan, they'll hear their favourite tunes in a slightly different way, but for a classical music audience who perhaps aren't familiar with the Radiohead repertoire, they'll hear a symphonic concert that happens to be music by Radiohead."It's our way of trying to bridge that gap."Allow Instagram content?This article contains content provided by Instagram.
