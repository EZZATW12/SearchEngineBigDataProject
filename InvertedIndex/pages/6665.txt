Finding herself with nothing to do, she tried classes offered by charity Cambridge Community Arts."It saved my life - sometimes I need a reason to get out of bed in the morning and it kickstarts me, it gives me structure," she said."I hadn't wound down to retiring, it was just overnight and it was a terrible shock," she added."I didn't know what to do with myself."Her daughter picked up a leaflet about a free origami class at a local church, and she has since completed courses in drama and creative writing.Having not considered herself a creative person, she says she can now reel off a list of art pursuits when her former colleagues ask what she is doing."Everyone is amazed, and I am amazed as well because yes, I am now creative," she said."I can't speak highly enough of the whole venture."Cambridge Community Arts aims to improve health and wellbeing with classes at 48 venues across the county. Many are free, with fees for paid courses waived for those who qualify.Its new courses include Kick-Start Your Novel, led by Cambridge crime writer Lynn Fraser, painting and embroidery. "We create safe, welcoming spaces where adults can explore their creativity and build confidence," said Emily Jolley, its chief executive. "Whether you're a complete beginner or returning to a creative practice, you'll find encouragement, inspiration, and connection."Follow Cambridgeshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.Related internet linksCambridge Community ArtsMore on this story Art event founder was 'incomparable painter'Art by more than 500 youngsters a city's 'legacy'Peruvian art celebrating 'richness' of the FensCambridgeGirtonArtRelatedDevelopment could see fewer car parking spaces4 hrs agoCambridgeshireUnopened Victorian soft drink bottle found at dig1 day agoCambridgeshireThe 'surprising' legacies of Windrush generation2 days agoCambridgeshireMore4 hrs agoCeramic cats purchased by museum 'huge mews'The two cats are bought for £6,000 from grants and trustees of an art gallery. 4 hrs agoBeds, Herts & Bucks5 hrs agoRadiohead reimagined with classical twist in home cityLondon Concertante's Radiohead Reimagined plays Christ Church Cathedral in Oxford.5 hrs agoOxfordshire5 hrs agoArt gallery to be filled with technicolour displayThe Microworld exhibition will be on display at the Ferens Art Gallery until 7 September.5 hrs agoHull & East Yorkshire1 day agoA portrait of a city through its peopleA photography exhibition showcasing the residents of Wolverhampton is on display from 28 April.1 day agoWolverhampton2 days agoRoman-style mosaic unveiled at sea watching spotThe artwork by Turner Prize winner Jeremy Deller is a permanent public installation.2 days agoNorth YorkshireBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.
