The artwork, by Turner Prize winner Jeremy Deller and mosaicist Coralie Turpin, measures 27.5ft (8.4m) long and 20ft (6m) wide and is a permanent installation. It spans the floor of a new sea watching station on Marine Drive, which is a renovated 1990s seaside shelter with free telescopes for viewing marine life. Deller said: "I wanted to make a piece of public art that didn't get in the way of the view because there's a great view here.""It's meant to be almost invisible until you stand on it and I like the idea of that," he said.Jules ListerThe artwork is in fragments and is based on Roman mosaicsDeller came up with the idea for a Roman mosaic reflecting the wildlife in Scarborough and Turpin helped bring it to life. It depicts a whale, a ship, dolphins and the various marine life on the Scarborough coast."Coralie is a mosaicist and she knew how to make an idea happen," Deller said."The idea is sometimes the easy bit, making something that is thousands of hours of work is the difficult part."Alongside her team, Turpin hand cut up to 300,000 pieces of tile to put the mosaic together, which took six months to complete. "It looks like it has been discovered during an archaeological dig," she said."It's fragmentary, so you would only have found little sections of it."Turpin said the colour scheme was based on Roman mosaics, which had originally been made using marble. Jules ListerThe project was a collaboration between Invisible Dust, an art and science organisation, and Yorkshire Wildlife TrustThe project was a collaboration between art and science organisation Invisible Dust and Yorkshire Wildlife Trust. Jeanine Griffin, curator at Invisible Dust, said: "The aim is to really engage people with the amazing wildlife on their doorstep and draw in people who are interested in nature and culture to Scarborough, as a year-round tourist offer."It's a really beautiful spot elevated above the sea, you can see right over the seawall to look at pods of dolphins."Information panels on marine life have been installed inside the station.Listen to highlights from North Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North.More on this storyPlans for sea life viewing station in coastal townPlan for coastal wildlife viewing station approvedRelated Internet linksYorkshire Wildlife TrustInvisible DustScarboroughArtRelatedAppeal for more short-term carers for children1 hr agoNorth YorkshireVE Day 80th celebrations in North Yorkshire2 days agoNorth YorkshireSupported living plan for church hall3 days agoNorth YorkshireMore4 hrs agoCeramic cats purchased by museum 'huge mews'The two cats are bought for £6,000 from grants and trustees of an art gallery. 4 hrs agoBeds, Herts & Bucks5 hrs agoRadiohead reimagined with classical twist in home cityLondon Concertante's Radiohead Reimagined plays Christ Church Cathedral in Oxford.5 hrs agoOxfordshire5 hrs agoArt gallery to be filled with technicolour displayThe Microworld exhibition will be on display at the Ferens Art Gallery until 7 September.5 hrs agoHull & East Yorkshire1 day agoA portrait of a city through its peopleA photography exhibition showcasing the residents of Wolverhampton is on display from 28 April.1 day agoWolverhampton1 day ago'Creative courses on my doorstep saved my life'Former teacher Beverley Mavin says she found a new outlet after the "terrible shock" of redundancy.1 day agoCambridgeshireBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.
