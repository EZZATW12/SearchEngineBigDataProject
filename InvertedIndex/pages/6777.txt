They play a vital role in enabling people to travel with confidence and stay connected in London."By looking up, offering our seat, and being mindful of non-visible disabilities, we can help to make public transport more accessible and inclusive."Transport for LondonThe deputy mayor for transport asked people to offer their seat to "those who may need it more"Previous TfL research looked at how likely people were to get a priority seat if they needed one.It found that while many people who needed a seat got one, it was not always clear when someone needed a priority seat and people were not always paying attention to their surroundings to notice if someone needed a seat.More than 152,000 free "please offer me a seat" badges have been issued since 2017.They can be used by people with a broad range of disabilities and conditions including chronic pain, respiratory conditions and diabetes, learning disabilities, autism, other forms of neurodivergence and mental health conditions.
