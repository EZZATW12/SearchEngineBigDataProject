Denmark's territory, when we are met by pressure and by threats from our closest ally, what are we to believe in, about the country that we have admired for so many years?"Frederiksen rode around the capital Nuuk in a Danish navy patrol boat, alongside Egede and Nielsen.According to Danish public broadcaster DR, many people cheered at seeing the Danish prime minister, with one resident shouting from a window: "Hey Mette! Thanks for being here."Egede, who served as prime minister for almost four years, said the island had cooperated with the US on security for almost 80 years - including the construction of the Pituffik Space Base following a 1951 agreement between Denmark and the United States. The former leader insisted Greenland was not for sale, but added the island wanted trade with the US, Greenlandic national newspaper Sermitsiaq reported.Trump first floated the idea of buying Greenland during his first term - and his desire to own the island has only grown with time.Mikaela Engell, an expert on the Arctic territory who previously served as Denmark's High Commissioner to Greenland, told AFP news agency "it's very, very important and it's very reassuring for Greenlanders to see a Danish head of government."Greenland - the world's biggest island, between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans - has been controlled by Denmark, nearly 3,000km (1,860 miles) away, for about 300 years.Greenland governs its own domestic affairs, but decisions on foreign and defence policy are made in Copenhagen.Five of the six main parties favour independence from Copenhagen, but disagree over the pace with which to reach it.A new Greenland coalition government was formed in March, led by the centre-right Democrats party which favours a gradual approach to independence.Polls show that the vast majority of Greenlanders also want to become independent from Denmark, but do not wish to become part of the US.Since 2009, Greenland has had the right to call an independence referendum, though in recent years some political parties have begun pushing more for one.Greenland's opposition wins election dominated by independence and TrumpWhy does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?Mette FrederiksenGreenlandDenmarkUnited StatesRelatedGreenland not a piece of property, says PM after Trump threats17 hrs agoWorldGreenland's dark history - and does it want Trump?3 Feb 2025BBC InDepthPolish man jailed for four months for punching Danish PM7 Aug 2024EuropeMore11 mins agoDozens of African migrants killed in US strike on Yemen, Houthis sayHouthi-run media report 68 bodies have been recovered from a detention centre in Saada that was holding African migrants.11 mins agoWorld4 hrs agoCanada votes in pivotal election transformed by TrumpThe US president came to dominate on the campaign trail, with the contest being viewed as a referendum on how Canada should engage with him.4 hrs agoUS & Canada8 hrs agoTrump 'thinks' Zelensky ready to give up Crimea to RussiaThe latest comments by the US president come despite Kyiv repeatedly rejecting ceding the peninsula.8 hrs agoWorld9 hrs agoThe rapid remaking of a nation, in 100 daysThe impact of what President Trump has done so far is being felt in every corner of American life.9 hrs agoUS & Canada16 hrs agoDrag Race and Pose star Jiggly Caliente dies aged 44The drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a "severe infection", her family says.16 hrs agoWorldBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.
