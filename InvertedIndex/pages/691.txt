She played the role of Veronica in the TV drama Pose, which chronicled New York's LGBT ball culture in the 1980s and 90s.Caliente, who publicly came out as transgender in 2016, later returned to the Drag Race universe, competing in the sixth series of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars in 2021 and judging the spin-off show Drag Race Philippines for three series. Prior to her death, the drag performer's family had said on Thursday that she had suffered a "serious health setback" which led to the loss of "most of her right leg".TelevisionRuPaul's Drag RacePhilippinesUnited StatesRelatedGlow Up is back, and Thunderbolts* hits cinemas: What's coming up this week15 hrs agoCultureWallace seeks 'space to heal' after saying claims against him 'not all true'2 days agoCultureCelebrity Big Brother 2025 winner revealed2 days agoCultureMoreJust nowDozens of African migrants killed in US strike on Yemen, Houthis sayHouthi-run media report 68 bodies have been recovered from a detention centre in Saada that was holding African migrants.Just nowWorld3 hrs ago'Her legacy will slay': Drag Race stars mourn Jiggly CalienteThe Filipina-American transwoman died early Saturday after suffering from a "severe infection".3 hrs agoAsia4 hrs agoCanada votes in pivotal election transformed by TrumpThe US president came to dominate on the campaign trail, with the contest being viewed as a referendum on how Canada should engage with him.4 hrs agoUS & Canada8 hrs agoTrump 'thinks' Zelensky ready to give up Crimea to RussiaThe latest comments by the US president come despite Kyiv repeatedly rejecting ceding the peninsula.8 hrs agoWorld9 hrs agoThe rapid remaking of a nation, in 100 daysThe impact of what President Trump has done so far is being felt in every corner of American life.9 hrs agoUS & CanadaBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.
