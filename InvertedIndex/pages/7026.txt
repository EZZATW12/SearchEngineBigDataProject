It's an ancient place that is also home to one of Europe's oldest continually inhabited streets.Vicars' Close was created in the mid-14th Century to be the communal home of Vicars Choral - Wells Cathedral's male choir, first founded in 1100.Despite technically being a public road, the historic homes and buildings in the Close have remained virtually off-limits to visitors since the medieval period.Now a new conservation project hopes to throw open some of its doors to visitors. And in the process, help save the fabric of Vicars' Close for generations to come.Video by Howard Timberlake23 July 2024HistoryShareSaveUncovering a hangar full of rare historic campervansWatch what happens when we try to take one of the world's oldest motor homes, a 1935 Pontiac, for a spin.1 hr agoThe Travel ShowLilly Sabri talks after two year silence on social mediaThe fitness influencer went silent after a story about her fiancee allegedly cheating went viral.3 days agoWorld of BusinessHighly unlikely for tariffs to be ratcheted up, expert saysDavid Waddell says markets have sniffed out that there are reasons to be less pessimistic in this environment.3 days agoOpening BellWeek in Markets - 25 Apr 2025A weekly summary of the big stories from financial markets around the world.3 days agoWorld of BusinessExploring the desert secrets of a lost Nabataean worldAn art critic uncovers mysteries from this ancient culture within Saudi Arabia's sandy landscape.3 days agoCulture & ExperiencesThe tech that can help you pick better perfumesCan AI help this BBC reporter simplify her perfume choices?4 days agoTech NowWatch rare Gobi bear's reaction to finding waterSo rare they were thought to be a myth and undertake arduous journeys of up to 100 miles to find water.5 days agoNatural wondersThe spectacle of a great Pelican feeding bonanzaThe dam at Marsh Lake, Minnesota, has created an unexpected opportunity for pelicans.6 days agoNatural wondersThe ancient history of Iceland's warring Viking familiesThe Travel Show visits an immersive experience that brings to life a brutal battle between Iceland's Vikings.7 days agoThe Travel ShowYannick Nézet-Séguin: From child podigy to modern maestroThe renowned conductor and music director of the Met Opera reveals how a calling became his lifelong journey.7 days agoArts in MotionExplore the tiny biodegradable pacemaker for newbornsResearchers have created a pacemaker smaller than a grain of rice that does not require open surgery to implant.18 Apr 2025InnovationWhy you might be younger than you think you areThere is a difference between our chronological and biological age, which we have the power to control.16 Apr 2025Health DecodedMalaysian trade minister on US tariffsMalaysia's minister Zafrul Aziz will be representing the ASEAN bloc in its negotiations with the US.16 Apr 2025World of BusinessTen striking images of an Earth scarred by humansFrom a shipwrecking yard in Bangladesh to a river of iron dioxide in Canada, a deep dive in Ed Burtynsky's work.16 Apr 2025EarthUp-close with giant river otters as they learn how to fishIt takes three years for an otter cub to master the complexities of a successful hunt.15 Apr 2025World of wonderA historic look at the iconic VW campervanThe Travel Show sets off on a journey to celebrate an instantly recognisable travel icon, the VW campervan.14 Apr 2025The Travel ShowWeek in Markets - 11 Apr 2025A weekly summary of the big stories from financial markets around the world.11 Apr 2025World of BusinessInside one of the world's most remote restaurants'Off-Map Destination' winner Wolfgat offers a menu made from hyper-local and foraged ingredients.11 Apr 2025World's Table'Economic uncertainty will lower investment' - 11 Apr 2025Tech sector venture capitalist says the global economic uncertainty will mean less investment for private equity.11 Apr 2025Opening BellThe bitcoin miners in rural ZambiaTech Now visits Zambia to see how Bitcoin is helping to provide villagers with electricity.11 Apr 2025Tech NowBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.
