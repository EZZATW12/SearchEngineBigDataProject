But off the state's northern coast in Lake Huron is a serene, scenic island that has been luring travellers for hundreds of years – and has banned cars pretty much since they were invented.Welcome to Mackinac Island: a 3.8-sq-km island home to 600 year-round residents, no motorised vehicles and the only US highway where you're not allowed to drive a car. Even golf carts are prohibited on the island's streets, so chances are if you hear a honk or a screech, it's from one of the island's geese or owls.But why the absence of autos?Because as Urvana Tracey Morse, who owns a craft store on the island's main drag, says: "Horse is king here."Getty ImagesMackinac is an idyllic island that has banned cars pretty much since they were invented (Credit: Getty Images)According to local lore, when a car backfired in 1898, scaring horses nearby, village authorities banned internal combustion engines, a move that was extended to the rest of the island two years later. Ever since, locals have leaned into this tranquil, once-upon-a-time way of life.More than a century later, some 600 horses keep things running here, from the depths of winter to the mad summer rush when roughly 1.2 million people board a 20-minute ferry from Mackinaw City or St Ignace on Michigan's Upper Peninsula and descend on the small village (also called Mackinac Island) on the island's southern tip. There, visitors shop for the village's famous fudge, explore its 70 miles of trails and soak up the clip-clopping sounds of a simpler time.Rediscovering AmericaRediscovering America is a BBC Travel series that tells the inspiring stories of forgotten, overlooked or misunderstood aspects of the US, flipping the script on familiar history, cultures and communities."Horses are used in everything from garbage removal to FedEx deliveries," says Morse, who has been selling scrimshaw, art, jewellery and other merchandise after first visiting as a college student in 1990. "That's how our lifestyle has been; that's how our pace is.""Part of us just like the tradition that we get around by bike, or we walk or take the horse taxi," Morse adds.For hundreds of years, Indigenous communities used the island's strategic location at the confluence of Lake Huron and Lake Michigan as a fishing and hunting ground. They thought its limestone bluffs and green forests resembled a giant turtle rising from the water, so they named it Michilimackinac, or "place of the great turtle" in Anishinaabemowin.Mackinac Island Tourism BoardThe island is home to a defensive fort where reenactors still fire cannons (Credit: Mackinac Island Tourism Board)British forces shortened the name and established a defensive fort on the island in 1780. Today, visitors can still follow costumed interpreters, experience cannon firings and see an officer's quarters inside the oldest building in Michigan. But more than 200 years after the US took control of Mackinac following the War of 1812, its Indigenous roots remain. Saddle UpVisitors keen on getting in on the action can rent their own horse or horse-drawn buggy to explore the island, upon taking a short lesson."Mackinac Island is one of the most important [and] prominent places in Anishnaabe history and culture," says Eric Hemenway, an Anishnaabe member who has been instrumental in reviving Indigenous history on the island. "The Anishnaabeek people have been at the Straits [the waterways connecting Lake Huron and Lake Michigan], some say, since time immemorial. And we are still at the place of our ancestors here at the Straits. The waters were, and continue to be, the highways of the Midwest."As Hemenway points out, a large number of Indigenous burial sites have been found on the island – some of which go back roughly 3,000 years. "[Mackinac] is one of our most sacred spots on the Great Lakes," he says.Hemenway has also worked on the development of the Biddle House, which is home to the Mackinac Island Native American Museum that opened in 2021.Mackinac Island Tourism BoardThe governor of Michigan recently pitched Mackinac Island as the location for the next season of The White Lotus (Credit: Mackinac Island Tourism Board)"My biggest success [metric] is when I see other Native people come through… this is our story," says Hemenway. "[The island has] a touristy perception now, but the layers to this place are there."By the late 19th Century, Mackinac Island had become a playground for wealthy industrialist families from Chicago, Detroit and other parts of the once-thriving Midwest, who flocked to the island in summer to unwind in its pristine waters. More like this:• The only land disputed between the US and Canada• The US island that speaks Elizabethan English• Dearborn, Michigan: A visit to the first Arab-majority city in the USMackinac's 138-year-old Grand Hotel has individually decorated rooms and claims to have the world's longest porch; it's also one of the last fully functioning hotels from industrial America's Gilded Age. Such is the Grand Hotel's unique appeal that Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer recently took to X to pitch the island as the location for season four of HBO's The White Lotus.While the pitch was playful, Morse is hesitant for Mackinac to become overtouristed. "You're proud of where you live; but at the same time I kind of don't want to tell people how cool it is here," she says.Getty ImagesVisitors can hike, bike or take a horse-drawn carriage to Arch Rock (Credit: Getty Images)Indeed, this pint-sized island packs a punch. Eighty percent of Mackinac's land area is comprised of Mackinac Island State Park, where visitors can stroll through old-growth forest, admire towering limestone pillars, and hike, bike or hire a horse-drawn carriage to photograph one of the island's most famous attractions – the 50ft-wide Arch Rock.Elsewhere, locals suggest heading north from the island's one village to ramble the 8.5-mile highway turned bike-and-hiking trail that runs the circumference of the island and offers views of the five-mile-long Mackinac suspension bridge and access to quiet pebble-covered beaches and woodlands.Horses aside, the island's 1,500 bikes for hire are the main way residents and visitors get around – a self-propelled mode of transport that suggests Mackinac residents are happy to move at a different pace than the rest of the country.Living in a place without cars is one of the main reasons why Morse, who rides her bike nine months of the year, has decided to live year-round on the island, despite the harsh winters."I just love the idea of getting on my bike and coming down [to the village] through the trees. It sets me for the day," she says. "You are always greeting and talking to people."Getty ImagesRoughly 1,500 bikes are available to hire on the small island (Credit: Getty Images)But while cycling is the easiest and most popular mode of transport, bikes clearly play a secondary role in powering the island."Without the horses, this place wouldn't be what it is. It's what makes you feel like you've stepped back in time when you get off the boat and you hear that 'clip-clop'," says Hunter Hoaglund, who works at Arnold Freight, a company that has run a ferry service to the island for 140 years and ships in a herd of its horses that overwinter on Michigan's Upper Peninsula every April. "We have our trucks show up here each day [dropping off the horses], and within the next month we'll probably see 200 to 300 more show up." An estimated 20-30 horses remain on the island during the winter to collect garbage, deliver packages and otherwise keep the island running.   Surrounded by crystal-clear water, Mackinac can be periodically cut off from the mainland in winter when ice floes can halt ferry services to or from the island.But in spring and summer, Mackinac comes alive.Mackinac Island Tourism Bureau"Without horses, this place wouldn't be what it is" (Credit: Mackinac Island Tourism Bureau)The dozens of lilac trees dotted along the village streets start to bloom in the lead up to the island's popular 10-day Lilac Festival in June. Stargazers head to Mackinac's Fort Holmes – the highest point on the island – and the Grand Hotel's Cupola Bar for unfiltered views of the northern Michigan night sky. But for most visitors, happily tuckered out after biking around the island, an ice cream or piece of fudge is best enjoyed overlooking the marina.And all without the sound of a car engine to spoil the experience.--If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. For more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram. HistoryFeaturesWatchWhy we're still talking about Maud WagnerHow America's first professional female tattooist broke through into an art form historically dominated by men.4 Mar 2025HistoryThe insulting 'Vinegar Valentine' of Victorian EnglandValentine’s Day is thought to celebrate romance but rude cards soured the holiday for its recipients.14 Feb 2025HistoryRichard III: The 'accidental' photo of a long-lost kingWhy a famous photograph of King Richard III's skeleton was a happy 'accident'.11 Feb 2025HistoryThe WW2 experiment to make pigeon-guided missilesAn unexpected WW2 experiment by behaviourist B F Skinner proved that pigeons could be used for missile guidance.4 Feb 2025HistoryAmerica's last Revolutionaries: Rare photos of US patriotsHow a dwindling group of veterans from the American War of Independence were featured in early photographic form.7 Jan 2025HistoryIdris Elba on moment he learned about Mandela's deathThe actor recalls being at the Mandela film premiere when he heard the anti-apartheid politician had died.7 Dec 2024HistoryMary Mallon: 'The most dangerous woman in America'How Mary Mallon, an Irish cook for New York's elite, became known as the 'most dangerous woman in America'.17 Nov 2024HistoryWorld War One relics live on in the fields of EuropeThe battlegrounds of World War One are still giving up their revealing evidence of bitter fighting.12 Nov 2024HistoryThe picture that tells a lesser-known chapter of US historyHow a 1892 photo from Rougeville, Michigan, became the most iconic image of the bison massacre in America.22 Oct 2024HistoryThe history of swing states in the USThe US Presidential elections did not always depend on just these seven states.21 Oct 2024HistoryWhy tonnes of mummified cats ended up in EnglandIn 1890 an estimated cargo of 180,000 ancient felines, weighing 19.5 tonnes, were auctioned off in Liverpool.18 Sep 2024HistoryInside the ancient royal tomb found by accidentThe Thracian Tomb of Kazanlak was accidentally discovered by Bulgarian soldiers digging up shelters in 1944.11 Sep 2024ArchaeologyVarna Necropolis: World's oldest gold treasureThe Varna treasure is considered the world's oldest human processed gold, dating back 6,500 years.10 Sep 2024ArchaeologyThe giant 350-year-old model of St Paul's CathedralHiding in a London cathedral is an intricate wooden mock-up of Sir Christopher Wren's masterpiece.5 Sep 2024HistoryUncovering the sunken relics of an ancient cityBettany Hughes goes underwater in search of ancient archaeological finds in historic Sozopol, Bulgaria.4 Sep 2024ArchaeologyTexas fever: The lesser-known history of the US borderIn 1911, a fence was constructed on the US-Mexico border.
