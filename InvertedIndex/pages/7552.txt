The sky is typically blue and spotless, so reprieve under the shade of a passing cloud is non-existent while the humidity is as thick as a fleece blanket. One way to cool off is in the country-wide water fights that take place during the annual celebrations (this year from 13-15 April), which include water guns, buckets and coloured powder smeared onto the face like war paint. Another way to celebrate and cool off is to eat khao chae.Khao chae (soaked rice) is an icy, seasonal treat that marks the beginning of summer in Thailand. The history of the dish can be traced back hundreds of years to the Mon people, an ethnic group that originated throughout Myanmar and Thailand and integrated into what was then Siamese society in the 16th Century.[jump to recipe]"The form of khao chae that we're looking at right now, especially in Bangkok, has very little resemblance to the Mon khao chae," says Leela Punyaratabandhu, a Thai scholar and the author of the 2017 cookbook Bangkok, which includes a recipe for khao chae. In the 16th Century, the soaked rice porridge was served in terracotta pots to keep the dish cold because ice wasn't readily available. The accompanying side dishes were also not nearly as intricate as they would eventually become.It was within the kingdom of Siam's royal family, dating back to King Rama IV's rule in the 19th Century, that the dish blossomed into something far more complex – a metamorphosis of its humble origins. A lot of effort was made to ensure that khao chae looked visually beautiful, so side dishes included delicately carved vegetables shaped into flowers. In addition, ice, which was impossible for commoners to get at the time, distinguished kaho chae as an exclusively royal dish.The recipe that exists now has been passed down through generations of royal cooks and aristocratic families. The dish starts by vigorously washing jasmine rice to remove all the starch. "You have to wash the rice more than regular steamed rice so it doesn't stick together when cooked," explains Max Wittawat, the executive chef of New York City's Bangkok Supper Club. Wittawat grew up in Bangkok and was taught to make khao chae by culinary artist and teacher Jantararat Hemvej, who is known in Bangkok for having perfected khao chae.Since the rice also needs to withstand being soaked for long periods without falling apart, which would render the dish cloudy, washing it is especially important. After it's steamed, the rice is submerged in ice water that's perfumed with the scent of flowers, ranging from jasmine, ylang ylang, damask roses and bread flowers. "It's a mark of summer when the flowers bloom," adds Wittawat.Calvste/Getty ImagesJasmine (pictured), ylang ylang, damask roses and bread flowers are used to perfume the water for the rice (Credit: Calvste/Getty Images)Punyaratabandhu has childhood memories of her grandfather using a spreadsheet to track the specific times that the flowers bloomed in his garden. "All of this was very systematic," she says. It's important to pick the flowers at the precise time – typically the evening before preparing khao chae – in order to achieve the optimal fragrance. From there, the flowers are submerged in water for at least two hours to imbue their aroma. Even the process of soaking the flowers is very intentional. If the flowers are left in the water for too long, they will bruise and go bad, leaving the water with a pungent and off-putting flavour. If they aren't steeped long enough, the bouquet will not be impactful enough to stand up to the side dishes served alongside khao chae. To enhance the dish's fragrance even further, a Thai culinary candle known as tian op may be used to smoke the flowery water.And that's just the base of the dish. Khao chae is an experience that includes many elaborate accoutrements. "It's not only hard to make, but it's hard to eat as well," says Punyaratabandhu. This is because there are a lot of pungent, salty and fishy flavours that could be unfamiliar to some. "Shrimp paste balls mixed with fish and then dipped in egg and fried? It's a far cry from pad see ew [stir-fried noodles]."When Punyaratabandhu began writing her cookbook, she struggled with whether or not she should include a recipe for khao chae, knowing how impractical and challenging the dish can be to prepare at home. "I knew it was going to be a tough sell, but also it's a part of Bangkok," she explains. "My job was to be faithful to whatever is happening in Bangkok."More like this:• A rice dish with 'sexual power'• The 3,000-year-old new year's celebration• The Thai noodles eaten for breakfastEven Wittawat admits that khao chae, outside of the aristocratic society of Bangkok, was not really in Thailand's zeitgeist until the past 10 years, when many chefs began reflecting on their Thai heritage and exploring culturally significant and historical dishes. "Before that, it was very old school and not common in restaurants," he says. "But nowadays, with technology, the flowers can bloom throughout the year, and it has risen so much in popularity." Recently, khao chae has become a social media darling due to its myriad side dishes, like shrimp paste dumplings, elaborately carved vegetables, stuffed shallots and peppers, sweetened beef and pork jerky and delicate egg nests. It's visually stunning, especially when served in traditional Thai pots or tiffins. "Sometimes, it's too pretty to eat," Wittawat says.There is a particular way to enjoy the dish to avoid muddying the crystal-clear flower-scented water. "You're not supposed to put all the condiments with the rice," Wittawat says. Instead, you should alternate eating the rice and side dishes. Vegetables and pickles can cut through the heavier flavours of sweetened beef and salty shrimp paste. "This is the fun thing about khao chae," Wittawat says, acknowledging that the various flavours work in tandem to keep the meal fresh and exciting. "You can continue eating more and more."Wittawat is happy that khao chae, once exclusive to the royal family and upper echelon of Thai society, is now more readily available and accessible to everyone – especially during Songkran, when Thailand is so hot. "Thai people are returning to their roots," he says. "They're appreciating their history and culture.Max WittawatKhao chae (soaked rice) is an icy, seasonal dish served with myriad accoutrements (Credit: Max Wittawat)Khao chae recipeby Max WittawatServes 8This is a general overview of how to make the rice for khao chae, along with two side dishes.

Cook the rice in boiling water until half-cooked, then strain. Wash the rice in water again, using your hands to rub the rice; rinse and repeat until the water becomes clear. Transfer the rice to a steamer and steam until fully cooked. Let cool.Step 2To make the shrimp balls, blend all the ingredients (except the eggs and oil) in a blender until smooth. Pour into a large nonstick frying pan and cook until thick paste forms. Let cool slightly, then roll into small balls.Step 3Heat the oil in a medium pot. Dip the shrimp balls into beaten eggs, then deep-fry until golden brown. Set aside. (Reserve the oil for the green peppers.)Step 4Pound the coriander, garlic and peppercorns in a mortar with a pestle until smooth, then mix with the minced pork and shrimp. Season with sugar and salt. Stuff the mixture into the green peppers. Set the peppers into a steamer and steam for 10mins.Step 5To make the egg net, reheat the oil in the pot. Beat all the eggs together and strain through a sieve. Dip 5 fingers in the beaten eggs and shake into the pot of heated oil left to right, then up and down to form an egg net. When the eggs turn golden brown, transfer the egg net to a kitchen towel and place the steamed stuffed peppers on top, then roll the egg net around the peppers. Repeat with the remaining peppers.Step 6Spoon the steamed rice into bowls and pour the cold scented over it. Enjoy the khao chae with the shrimp balls and stuffed peppers, as well as sliced cucumber, green mango, scallion and lesser ginger. NoteTo make the scented water, steep jasmine, ylang-ylang (กระดังงา) and chommanard (ชมนาด) flowers with drinking water and (if using) smoke with a Thai aromatic candle (เทียนหอม) overnight. Once the water is infused, strain it, then chill thoroughly.This story was originally published in 2024.BBC.com's World's Table "smashes the kitchen ceiling" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.--Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on X, and Instagram.If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.FeaturesFood & DrinkWatchWould you eat a meal dreamed up by a computer?AI v The Mind: We explore the world of food and ask if human expertise is the only way to deliver great flavour.23 Aug 2024InnovationTurkey's wild and rugged Black Sea regionFood writer Nick Kwek finds out how the wild landscape of Turkey's Black Sea region influences local cuisine.1 Aug 2024Food & DrinkThe blunder that changed chickens foreverHow this one simple mistake gave birth to the 50-billion-dollar US chicken industry.25 Mar 2024Food & DrinkThe hunt for the world's most expensive fungusReel takes you to Italy to explore how the world's rarest and most expensive ingredient ends up on our tables.4 Jan 2024Food & DrinkWhat food and drink is good for your memory?What we eat, it turns out, can have an impact on how well our memory works.2 Jan 2024Food & DrinkHow safe is frozen fruit?A huge recall of frozen fruits is currently happening across the US due to contamination fears. 21 Dec 2023Food & DrinkThe world's oldest drinkable champagneHow the discovery of the world's oldest drinkable champagne is inspiring new green solutions.17 Oct 2023Food & DrinkThe harmful legacy of poor nutritionWhat we eat, or don’t eat, can have a huge impact on us and the generations after us.28 Feb 2023Food & DrinkThe truth behind your favourite flavoursThe psychology and biology of flavour preference is some of the most fascinating science out there.2 Feb 2023Food & DrinkJapan: Creating the first wagyu beef in a labWe meet the scientists creating wagyu beaf, a Japanese delicacy with a distinctive texture, from cells.16 Jan 2023Food & DrinkHow a vegan diet can affect your brainCan changing to a vegan diet impact the health of your brain?4 Jan 2023Food & DrinkThe fight to feed humanityA look at how the world's farmers responding to some of the greatest threats to global food security.8 Nov 2022Food & DrinkThe surprising role chocolate played for ancient humansWe discover why the use of chocolate is older than we think, and the role it played for ancient humans.1 Nov 2022Food & DrinkHow beetroot can enhance your performanceIn the past decade, new evidence has suggested that nitrates in beetroots can enhance athletic performance.24 Oct 2022Food & DrinkThe truth about drinking raw milkThe debate for and against pasteurisation across industries and seas is a passionate one.3 Oct 2022Food & DrinkThe Russian food obsession inspired by the USWhat thick, tangy, creamy white sauce links Stalin, French haute cuisine and American mass industrialisation?30 Aug 2022Food & DrinkWhy is cod so popular in Portugal?From kings to dictators, Portugal’s leaders have always used cod as a political tool.11 Aug 2022Food & DrinkHow sushi took over the worldThinly sliced raw fish on plain white rice.
