Mr Francis said HCC had a "good story to tell" about Welsh farming and should not be "basing their pitch on something which is untrue".He also said the organisation was funded by the Welsh government which had a "proud record of showing leadership on the climate crisis".The Welsh government said HCC was an independent body and it was for it to "decide what they publish on their social media channels"."We would however, like any other body, expect them to be accurate and evidence-based," it said.Related storiesExtreme weather costing farmers millions - report'Nonsense' to base farming funding on populationRelated linksCymdeithas Eryri / Snowdonia SocietyHybu Cig Cymru - Meat Promotion WalesWalesMethaneGreenhouse gas emissionsWales businessClimateWales agriculture RelatedMurder accused appears in tearful court22 mins agoWalesThe never-ending juggle of managing school admin4 hrs agoWalesWales' papers: City fans call for Tan talks and Wrexham promoted5 hrs agoWalesMore24 mins ago'Wildfire sent years of work up in flames'A decade of conservation was wiped out in days when a wildfire ripped across the Glen Rosa valley.24 mins agoGlasgow & West Scotland1 day agoArea burned by UK wildfires in 2025 already at annual recordThe prolonged dry, sunny weather in March and April created ideal conditions for wildfires to spread.1 day agoClimate2 days agoAnger flares at Just Stop Oil 'last day of action'A van appears to have been driven slowly towards protesters as hundreds marched through London.2 days agoLondon3 days agoIs resurrecting extinct animals a good idea?The creation of three "dire wolf" pups has raised hopes that it may be possible to resurrect extinct animals.
