an area bigger than the size of the UK.The move was blocked after the country’s Socialist Left Party said it would not support the government’s budget unless it scrapped the first licensing round, set for 2025.Environmental scientists had warned the move could be catastrophic for marine life, while the plans were opposed by 32 countries including France, Canada, Brazil and Germany.Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoer called Sunday's development a “postponement” and said preparatory work on regulations and environmental impact would continue.Greenpeace Norway's Haldis Tjeldflaat Helle said the pause was "a huge win"."It has been truly embarrassing to watch Norway positioning itself as an ocean leader, while planning to give green light to ocean destruction in its own waters."The country's energy ministry has not yet commented.Deep-sea mining: Norway approves controversial practiceIs seabed mining an economic necessity or a hazard?Norway became the first country in the world to move forward with commercial-scale deep-sea mining when it approved the plans in January.The deep sea is home to minerals such as lithium, scandium and cobalt - which are critical for green technologies.Although the metals are available on land, they are concentrated in a small number of countries, increasing the risk to supply.Oslo said it did not want to rely on China for such materials, stressing it would only begin issuing licences once more environmental research was carried out.The move put Norway at odds with the EU and the UK, which have called for a temporary ban on the practice due to concerns about environmental damage.What is the UN High Seas Treaty and why is it needed?More than 100 EU lawmakers called on Oslo to reject the project, citing the risk "to marine biodiversity and the acceleration of climate change".The country’s Institute of Marine Research criticised the government’s research into the move's environmental impact - saying five to 10 more years of work were needed.The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) Norway said in a statement last week it was suing the government over the plans.At least three Norwegian seabed mineral start-ups had said they would bid in the first licensing round.On Monday, one of the start-ups - Green Minerals - said it expected a delay of up to a year following the plans' suspension.EuropeNorwayDeep sea miningRelatedCritical week for US's future in Ukraine-Russia talks, Rubio says2 hrs agoWorldEighty years on, survivors and families remember horrors of Bergen Belsen15 hrs agoEuropeRussia claims it has regained full control of Kursk from Ukraine2 days agoEuropeMore3 days agoTrump deep sea mining order violates law, China saysThe US president speeds up permits for a practice opposed by many countries and environmentalists.3 days agoScience & Environment30 Mar 2025Rocket crashes back to Earth just moments after launch in NorwayThe Spectrum rocket's first test flight lasted 30 seconds but researchers say it will still provide useful data.30 Mar 2025Europe7 Mar 2025Deep-sea mining tech advances but doubts remainDespite opposition investors are still looking at deep-sea mining technology.7 Mar 202526 Feb 2025British man dies and one injured while climbing in NorwayLocal media reported an avalanche fell while the men scaled a frozen waterfall on Friday.26 Feb 2025Europe13 Feb 2025Crew 'not wearing life jackets' in fatal capsizingRonald Mackinnon died after entering the water when the Njord capsized off Stavanger in 2022.13 Feb 2025NE, Orkney & ShetlandBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.
