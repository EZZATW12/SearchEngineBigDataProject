This is a team that was practically put together in the last week of the transfer window and to come together like they have makes me immensely proud of them."Parker, 44, took over at Turf Moor at the beginning of the season and edged out Daniel Farke of title rivals Leeds United, Sheffield United's Chris Wilder and Sunderland head coach Regis Le Bris to win the award.Burnley's astonishing defensive record meant goalkeeper James Trafford and centre-back pair Maxime Esteve and CJ Egan-Riley were named in the Championship team of the year, which also featured Leeds full-back Jayden Bogle, midfielder Ao Tanaka and winger Dan James.Brazil-born Dutchman Hamer has been the orchestrator of a Sheffield United team that have won 28 games - more than any other side in the Championship - as he saw off Trafford and James to win the award."I feel delighted, I'm buzzing," Hamer, 27, said. "Except from promotion as a team, this is the best reward you can get as a player."You can't do it without your team, we need each other. I can't thank my team-mates enough to get this prize."I speak a lot with our captain Jack Robinson and he said to me last week 'we need you more than ever at the moment'. That gives you a boost as player that the captain is giving you responsibility."I can be really happy with how I've done so far but we're not done yet."Image source, Rex FeaturesImage caption, Sunderland midfielders Chris Rigg and Jobe Bellingham have 12 goal contributions between them this seasonSunderland duo Jobe Bellingham and Chris Rigg won the young player and apprentice of the season awards for the Championship, having helped the Black Cats into the play-offs.Birmingham boss Davies has overseen a dominant season, racking up 105 points with two games still to play - a third-tier record since the introduction of three points for a win.Blues defenders Christoph Klarer and Alex Cochrane and midfielder Tomoki Iwata also made the League One team of the year.Davies beat Phil Parkinson, who has led runners-up Wrexham to three successive promotions, Charlton boss Nathan Jones and Leyton Orient's Richie Wellens to the award."My first season as a manager couldn't have gone any better but for the club, I'm really pleased we bounced back into the Championship and we've won it in style," Davies said."It's been a fantastic season, capped off by getting the points record."Double award winner Kone, who was playing in the ninth tier of English football only 13 months ago, said: "It's an unbelievable achievement. I wouldn't have thought of this a few years ago."To be standing there with not one but two awards and in the team of the year is well is just an amazing achievement. I am really proud of myself and enjoying the moment."The EFL goal of the season went to Notts County's on-loan Tottenham midfielder George Abbott for his phenomenal volley into the top corner at Accrington in League Two in January.Championship awardsImage source, Rex FeaturesImage caption, Norwich strike partners Josh Sargent and Borja Sainz, who have scored 32 goals between them, were named in the Championship team of the seasonManager of the season: Scott Parker (Burnley)Player of the season: Gustavo Hamer (Sheffield United)Young player of the season: Jobe Bellingham (Sunderland)Apprentice of the season: Chris Rigg (Sunderland)Team of the season: James Trafford (Burnley), Jayden Bogle (Leeds), CJ Egan-Riley (Burnley), Maxime Esteve (Burnley), Harrison Burrows (Sheffield United), Ao Tanaka (Leeds), Jobe Bellingham (Sunderland), Gustavo Hamer (Sheffield United), Dan James (Leeds), Borja Sainz (Norwich), Josh Sargent (Norwich).League One awardsManager of the season: Chris Davies (Birmingham)Player of the season: Richard Kone (Wycombe)Young player of the season: Richard Kone (Wycombe)Apprentice of the season: Jake Richards (Exeter)Team of the season: Sam Tickle (Wigan), Ryan Barnett (Wrexham), Max Cleworth (Wrexham), Lloyd Jones (Charlton), Christoph Klarer (Birmingham), Alex Cochrane (Birmingham), Lewis Bate (Stockport), Tomoki Iwata (Birmingham), Davis Keillor-Dunn (Barnsley), Kwame Poku (Peterborough), Richard Kone (Wycombe).League Two awardsManager of the season: Graham Alexander (Bradford)Player of the season: Michael Cheek (Bromley)Young player of the season: Nathan Lowe (Walsall, now at Stoke)Apprentice of the season: Jack Shorrock (Port Vale)Team of the season: Owen Goodman (AFC Wimbledon), Connor Barrett (Walsall), Connor Hall (Port Vale), Taylor Allen (Walsall), Denver Hume (Grimsby), Richie Smallwood (Bradford), Luke Molyneux (Doncaster), Jack Payne (Colchester), David McGoldrick (Notts County), Alassana Jatta (Notts County), Michael Cheek (Bromley).Other winnersGoal of the season: George Abbott (Notts County v Accrington)Community club of the season: NorwichCommunity project of the season: Plymouth, ACTing with ChildrenPlayer in the community: Taylor Moore (Bristol Rovers)Diversity award: Leyton Orient, Punjabi O'sGreen club award: Northampton, Cobblers tackle food wasteFan engagement award: Cardiff, 125th anniversary campaignClub employee award: Ian Darler (Cambridge)Sir Tom Finney award: Curtis DaviesContribution to league football award: Neil WarnockRelated topicsLeague TwoAFC WimbledonPort ValeColchester UnitedBromleyDoncaster RoversSunderlandBirmingham CityBarnsleyCharlton AthleticWycombe WanderersPeterborough UnitedBurnleyWalsallLeague OneWrexhamSheffield UnitedStockport CountyExeter CityWigan AthleticNorwich CityChampionshipFootballBradford CityGrimsby TownLeeds UnitedNotts CountyTop storiesLive.Â Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8749 viewing8.7k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published13 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
