Alonso on Real Madrid linksPublished18 April'The message will be clear - it's time for Ancelotti to move on'Published17 AprilWhy Real Madrid season could be seen as 'big failure'Published15 AprilIt appeared they would be frustrated by Bilbao and goalkeeper Unai Simon, who thwarted Eduardo Camavinga's rising drive and a Jude Bellingham header in a one-sided second half.Real thought they had made the breakthrough with 11 minutes remaining but Vinicius Jr's classy curler was ruled out for a marginal offside against Endrick in the build-up.It took a lengthy video assistant referee (VAR) delay to disallow the strike and, when the officials later deemed a clip on Bellingham in the area was not worth a review, it seemed another frustrating night was on the cards for the defending champions.But full-back Valverde, who had twice earlier gone within inches of breaking the deadlock, popped up late with his sublime strike to ease the pressure on Ancelotti, whose side next face Barcelona in the Copa del Rey final on Saturday.With ex-Real midfielder Xabi Alonso increasingly linked with the manager's job, Ancelotti admitted this week he would discuss his future at the Bernabeu in the summer despite having a deal until 2026. He is though expected to leave the club.Related topicsSpanish La LigaEuropean FootballFootballMore on this storyListen to the latest Football Daily podcastComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 64Spanish La Liga Scores & FixturesSunday 20th AprilReal Valladolid 2 , Osasuna 3 at Full timeValladolidReal ValladolidReal Valladolid23OsasunaOsasunaOsasunaFull timeFTVillarreal 2 , Real Sociedad 2 at Full timeVillarrealVillarrealVillarreal22Real SociedadReal SociedadReal SociedadFull timeFTSevilla 1 , Deportivo Alavés 1 at Full timeSevillaSevillaSevilla11AlavésDeportivo AlavésDeportivo AlavésFull timeFTReal Madrid 1 , Athletic Club 0 at Full timeReal MadridReal MadridReal Madrid10Athletic ClubAthletic ClubAthletic ClubFull timeFTView all Spanish La Liga fixturesSpanish La Liga TableOn Sunday 20th AprilSkip to table keyMatch Participants:Real Madrid, Position 2, Points 69Athletic Club, Position 4, Points 57TeamPlayedWonDrawnLostGoals ForGoals AgainstGoal DifferencePointsForm, Last 6 games, Oldest first1Barcelona32234588325673WResult WinWResult WinWResult WinDResult DrawWResult WinWResult Win2Real Madrid32216565313469WResult WinWResult WinWResult WinLResult LossWResult WinWResult Win3Atlético Madrid32189553272663LResult LossLResult LossDResult DrawWResult WinWResult WinLResult Loss4Athletic Club321512549262357DResult DrawWResult WinDResult DrawDResult DrawWResult WinLResult Loss5Villarreal311410755421352LResult LossLResult LossWResult WinDResult DrawWResult WinDResult Draw6Real Betis3113994239348WResult WinWResult WinWResult WinWResult WinDResult DrawLResult Loss7Mallorca32128123137-644DResult DrawWResult WinLResult LossLResult LossWResult WinDResult Draw8Celta Vigo32127134749-243WResult WinWResult WinDResult DrawWResult WinLResult LossLResult Loss9Real Sociedad32126143236-442LResult LossDResult DrawWResult WinWResult WinLResult LossDResult Draw10Rayo Vallecano321011113539-441LResult LossDResult DrawWResult WinLResult LossLResult LossDResult Draw11Osasuna3291493946-741LResult LossLResult LossDResult DrawDResult DrawWResult WinWResult Win12Getafe32109133129239WResult WinWResult WinLResult LossWResult WinLResult LossLResult Loss13Espanyol31108133440-638DResult DrawLResult LossDResult DrawWResult WinWResult WinWResult Win14Valencia32911123648-1238WResult WinDResult DrawWResult WinWResult WinWResult WinDResult Draw15Sevilla32910133543-837WResult WinLResult LossLResult LossLResult LossLResult LossDResult Draw16Girona3197153848-1034DResult DrawDResult DrawDResult DrawLResult LossLResult LossLResult Loss17Las Palmas3288163852-1432LResult LossDResult DrawDResult DrawLResult LossWResult WinWResult Win18Deportivo Alavés32710153446-1231WResult WinDResult DrawLResult LossWResult WinLResult LossDResult Draw19Leganés32611152948-1929LResult LossLResult LossLResult LossDResult DrawLResult LossDResult Draw20Real Valladolid3244242376-5316LResult LossLResult LossLResult LossLResult LossLResult LossLResult LossView latest Spanish La Liga tableKeyPosition 1 - 5 : UEFA Champions LeaguePosition 6 : UEFA Europa LeaguePosition 7 : UEFA Conference League QualifiersPosition 18 - 20 : RelegationLast Updated 20th April 2025 at 21:54Please Note: All times UK.
