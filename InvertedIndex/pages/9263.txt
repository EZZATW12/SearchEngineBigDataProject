Scorecard, IPL fixtures & results, tableCSK need to do 'soul-searching' to reflect on auction - Flemingpublished at 16:07 26 April16:07 26 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesChennai Super Kings head coach Stephen Fleming says they need to do a lot of "soul-searching" and reflect on where they went wrong at the Indian Premier League mega auction.The five-time champions are bottom of the 10-team table with two wins from nine games and have lost their past four home matches. Afghanistan leg-spinner Noor Ahmad and seamer Khaleel Ahmed have impressed but their only batter in the top 30 run-scorers is Shivam Dube, who was retained from 2024. "It's hard to say we got it completely right with the performances that we've had," said Fleming."We have been looking over that in detail, just around our style of play and also looking at how the game is evolving. "It is not easy, that is why we're proud of our record to date to be consistent for so long and it doesn't take much for it to go another way. Other teams have got better and that is the point of the auction but we just haven't been able to get it right. "That has to be an area where we need to reflect and say 'it hasn't been as good as it could have been' or it hasn't worked out how we wanted. "But, it is also not a perfect science, the auction is a very fluid beast. It is like buying 25 houses so you can come away from it mentally, and sometimes, physically exhausted."There's a lot of responsibility and soul-searching and that certainly starts at the top with me."Sunrisers beat fellow strugglers Chennaipublished at 21:00 25 April21:00 25 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesSunrisers Hyderabad beat Chennai Super Kings by five wickets in a match between the bottom two in the Indian Premier League.Both sides went into the game with just two wins from their opening eight games, but it is Chennai who remain rooted to the bottom after suffering a fourth successive home defeat.The five-time IPL winners were skittled out for 154 with one ball remaining in their innings, with Harshal Patel the pick of the bowlers taking 4-28.Hyderabad stumbled to 54-3 and 90-4 in their chase, but a fifth-wicket partnership worth 49 between Nitish Kumar Reddy (19) and Kamindu Mendis (32) saw them home with eight balls to spare.Kamindu hit the winning runs to complete a fine display that included bowling figures of 1-26 and a stunning catch to dismiss Chennai debutant Dewald Brevis.A first win in Chennai for Hyderabad lifts last season's finalists above Rajasthan Royals into eighth and within four points of the play-off places.Having been put into bat, the tone of Chennai's innings was set when opener Shaik Rasheed edged a wonderful seaming delivery from Mohammed Shami to first slip with the first ball of the match.Brevis, who joined Chennai last week as a replacement for the injured Gurjapneet Singh, showed the most resistance with a punchy 42 from 25 balls before falling to Kamindu's stunning diving catch at long-off.Hyderabad lost Abhishek Sharma with the second ball of their reply, but Travis Head (19) and Ishan Kishan (44) kept the innings on track.Noor Ahmad (2-42) removed Kishan and Aniket Verma (19) in successive overs as Chennai sensed an opening, before Kamindu and Nitish saw Hyderabad over the line.Scorecard, IPL fixtures & results, tableKarachi collapse hands Quetta victory in PSLpublished at 20:50 25 April20:50 25 AprilImage source, PCBA stunning collapse from Karachi Kings saw Quetta Gladiators claim a five-run victory in the Pakistan Super League.Karachi lost six wickets for 22 runs in the space of 5.4 overs as their chase disintegrated following a promising start.Needing 143, Karachi were cruising at 75-1 thanks to 47 from opener Tim Seifert and 30 from James Vince.But Seifert's dismissal at the end of the 12th over saw them slip from 93-2 to 115-8 with just 15 balls remaining.Hasan Ali's battling unbeaten 24 from 13 deliveries lifted Karachi back to within sight of victory, but it was too little, too late.Mohammad Wasim, Mohammad Amir and Khurram Shahzad picked up two wickets apiece for Quetta, who secured their second win of the season.Faheem Ashraf had earlier top-scored with 43 as Quetta scrambled their way to 142 all out, with Kusal Mendis (36) and Hasan Nawaz (35) the only other players to score more than 10.The win takes Gladiators level on points with Lahore Qalandars and Peshawar Zalmi with a game in hand, but they remain behind both sides in fifth because of their inferior net run-rate.Karachi stay second and four points behind leaders Islamabad United having played a game more.
