The rain was persistent and play was called off at 18:30 BST.Punjab had posted 201-4 from their 20 overs with Prabhsimran Singh making 83 off 49 balls and Priyansh Arya 69 off 35.The pair shared 120 for the opening wicket, with Arya dominating, before Prabhsimran went through the gears and looked to be propelling the Kings to a huge total.However Knight Riders fought back well and restricted the Kings to 43 in the final six overs, with Glenn Maxwell out for seven to continue his difficult tournament, with his average now eight after six innings.Both sides take a point each and Punjab remain fourth, while Kolkata are seventh but fourth points off the play-off places.
