England's series opener against the Windies is on 21 May.Asked about appointing a captain, Edwards told BBC Sport: "We're very close, it hopefully will be very soon."I'm looking forward to that being announced, and we can get moving. And obviously, with a series coming up in May, that's going to be really important."Knight and former head coach Jon Lewis were both sacked following an awful winter in which England lost every match in the Ashes and went out of the T20 World Cup in the group stage.Legendary former England batter Edwards was appointed as Lewis' replacement earlier this month.Edwards had previously stated that the new captain should be an England regular in all three formats, narrowing the field to Sciver-Brunt and potentially spinner Sophie Ecclestone, who is not thought to be in contention.In January, during the Ashes, Sciver-Brunt said she would "love" the opportunity to become captain.Edwards was speaking at the unveiling of a portrait of her in the Long Room at Lord's. The painting of the 45-year-old is just the third of a woman commissioned by the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), following fellow England internationals Rachael Heyhoe Flint and Claire Taylor."Women's cricket has come a long way," said Edwards. "To have a portrait of myself, up with some of the greats, it's quite overwhelming really. I'm hugely proud and really happy things have moved on. Women are allowed in this club and can experience this wonderful ground."Edwards, England's all-time leading runscorer, played more than 300 internationals between 1996 and 2016. In Edwards' 10-year spell as captain England won the Ashes three times, as well as both the 50-over and T20 World Cups.When Edwards first played at Lord's, in a one-day international against South Africa in 1997, women were still two years away from being allowed membership of the MCC and admittance to the Long Room."We were allowed in the changing room and down the stairs, then out by the committee room," said Edwards."It was a bit unusual. At the time I didn't really think anything of it. I just thought it was amazing to be playing at Lord's and I was overwhelmed by the occasion."I remember walking on to the turf and my legs just went to jelly. It was a wonderful occasion, but very different to what things are like now. To think I now have a painting in the pavilion is truly special."Related topicsEngland Women's Cricket TeamCricketMore on this storyGet cricket news sent straight to your phonePublished31 JanuaryTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8705 viewing8.7k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published13 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
