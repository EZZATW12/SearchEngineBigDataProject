It has also persuaded General Motors to enter F1.GM will run a Cadillac-branded new team next year using Ferrari engines and has pledged to have its own power-unit ready by 2029.The Bahrain meeting also kicked into the long grass a proposal to change the engine formula before 2030, although discussions will continue on this idea.On Thursday, no agreement was reached on the details of mechanisms by which manufacturers may be able to make up a shortfall.However, examples of ideas by which this could happen are to allow increased amounts of dynamometer testing or an increased engine budget cap to any who end up behind.This has been passed to the power-unit working group for further refinement.What is the electrical energy issue?One key concern about the 2026 rules is that it will be difficult for cars to recover sufficient energy from the rear axle to deploy the permitted maximum amount of electrical power through a lap.The aerodynamic rules have already been changed to accommodate this, by introducing moveable aerodynamics which will reduce drag on straights so cars have a faster top speed and are therefore braking for longer.Even so, some fear that drivers will have to 'lift-and-coast' from quite early on the straights on some circuits to optimise deployment and overall performance.There are some circuits where cars may run short of energy, and others where cars might have too much, which would curtail the effectiveness of the new push-to-pass electrical boost system being introduced next year in place of the current DRS overtaking aid.Some argue that the best way to solve this potential issue is to reduce the permitted amount of electrical power deployment in races to 200kw (about 270bhp) from 350kw (470bhp). It would stay at 350kw during qualifying and for the push-to-pass system.The idea is that this would 'smooth out' the deployment and make it more consistent around the lap.Among the teams, Red Bull are the biggest supporters of this idea.But Mercedes are strongly opposed - their F1 boss Toto Wolff has described the plan to change the rules as "a joke".Mercedes argue that there is no certainty that this will be a problem next year, and there cannot be until the cars have run and there is an accurate assessment of their aerodynamic performance.They say manufacturers will be able to react quickly next year if a problem emerges.Governing body the FIA said in a statement: "The F1 Commission discussed in principle refinements to the energy management strategy for 2026, as well as measures to address financial issues that can be faced by power-unit manufacturers that experience either low performance or significant reliability issues in 2026."All of these topics will be discussed in more detail among the specialists in the appropriate advisory committees."What other changes were discussed?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Grass fires interrupted practice at the Japanese Grand PrixBosses also debated ways to minimise the risk of grass fires, such as those that led to a series of red flags during practice at the Japanese Grand Prix last month.These were caused by sparks from the titanium skid blocks under the cars igniting dry grass beside the trackIt has been proposed that the titanium be replaced by steel at tracks where dry trackside grass could be a problem.The idea was not adopted, but the FIA will continue to pursue research on the topic.Related topicsFormula 1Comments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 439Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8413 viewing8.4k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published13 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
