Discussions as to what that may look like are at an early stage, including such considerations as to whether the engines would continue to be turbocharged.However, the manufacturers committed to hybrid as a part of engine technology in F1 in the future.Related topicsMotorsportFormula 1Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8413 viewing8.4k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published13 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
