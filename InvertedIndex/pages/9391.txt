The Dutchman, who is aiming to win a record-equalling fifth consecutive drivers' title this year, is third in the championship, eight points behind leader Lando Norris of McLaren. Round five takes place in Saudi Arabia this weekend, with Sunday's race starting at 18:00 BST. "A lot of people are talking about it except me," said Verstappen on Thursday. "Like I said before, I just want to focus on my car, work with the people in the team - that's the only thing I'm thinking about in Formula 1 at the moment."I'm very relaxed." Verstappen has a contract with Red Bull until 2028. But Marko told BBC Sport this month that it contains a performance clause that could allow him to depart the team.The 27-year-old has been linked with moves to Mercedes and Aston Martin for 2026 when new regulations are being introduced. He held talks with Mercedes last year but their team boss Toto Wolff said at the season-opener in Australia last month that a pitch to sign Verstappen for next season is "not on any radar". Asked in the drivers' news conference whether he would like Verstappen as a team-mate at Aston Martin, Fernando Alonso said: "Yes, but that's unlikely to happen, very unlikely." Alonso's current team-mate is Lance Stroll, the son of Aston Martin team owner Lawrence Stroll.Norris being forced to drive in 'uncomfortable ways'Published17 AprilHow to follow Saudi Arabian Grand Prix on the BBCPublished19 AprilVerstappen moved to within one point of Norris in the standings with a brilliant win at the Japanese Grand Prix from pole position two weeks ago. His weekend in Sakhir was a stark contrast to the highs of Suzuka as he qualified in seventh and finished the race three places lower than Briton Norris, who ended his day on the podium in third. Verstappen continued: "I just go race by race. I think [Saudi Arabia] will be better than Bahrain. The rest is out of my hands. "At the moment, we are not the quickest so it is tough to fight for a championship, but it is a long road. Last year here it all looked great and we know how the season ended up." Red Bull were untouchable in Jeddah last year with Verstappen first and then team-mate Sergio Perez second. But while the Dutchman went on to seal his fourth title in a row, Red Bull lost out to McLaren in the constructors' championship, eventually dropping behind Ferrari and finishing third. "I enjoyed last year and the year before when we were dominant," said Verstappen. "Now it is enjoyable in a way of the challenges that are out there and trying to improve the situation I would say."I am happy, I am not very happy with my car. But we all want to be better, there is no secret in that. We all want to improve."
