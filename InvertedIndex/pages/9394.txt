The 25-year-old Briton is leading the drivers' championship by three points from his McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri after finishing third in Bahrain. However, Norris was searingly honest about his sixth-place qualifying performance last week, saying he felt "clueless" and like he had "never driven an F1 car before". Speaking on Thursday before the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, Norris said he was having to "adapt a lot in uncomfortable ways". Verstappen 'very relaxed' about Red Bull futurePublished17 AprilHow to follow Saudi Arabian Grand Prix on the BBCPublished19 AprilHe added his approach to the high-speed nature of the Jeddah circuit will change slightly, partly because he is struggling to replicate the same form in the car that saw him finish second in the title race to Max Verstappen in 2024. "It is clear that there are things... things that have changed since last year, when I was feeling very comfortable. And that's not allowing me to do as good of a job this year," Norris said."It's not that I'm doing a bad job, it's just I'm not able to be at the level I should be, and know I can be and want to be."In order to perform better, I'm being forced to drive in a different way, in a different manner that I'm not used to. And that is not normal for me at all." Norris has been on the podium at every race so far and won the season opener in Melbourne in March, but his downcast nature in Sakhir was in stark contrast to Piastri's. The Australian, 24, won in China and Bahrain, and is much happier with the McLaren. "The pace of the car has been everything I could ask for," said Piastri. He added: "Very proud of the whole job that we have done, firstly giving us a great car and also helping me get the most out of it. "I think that's been a real strength so far this year and I feel like I am in a good place, on and off the track, and just trying to keep that going."This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Five things to know before the Saudi Arabian Grand PrixRelated topicsFormula 1More on this storyIs Piastri now favourite for drivers' title?Published15 April'A fascinating contrast between team-mates and title contenders'Published13 AprilComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 214Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9557 viewing9.6k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published13 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
