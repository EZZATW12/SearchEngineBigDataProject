They battled for several laps, and Norris accused Leclerc of forcing him off the track when he tried one move around the outside of Turn Four.But he fought back and finally made the move stick with eight laps to go.Norris then set off after Russell and was on his tail going into the final two laps.It looked like a move was on. But he perhaps miscalculated by making a half-move into Turn One on the final lap.It did not come off, and it left him too far behind to challenge the Mercedes driver into Turn Four, securing second for Russell.Norris said: "A tough race. I made too many mistakes. A messy race from me. Disappointed not to bring home a one-two for McLaren."F1 bosses reject V10 engine returnPublished11 AprilAndrew Benson Q&A: Send us your questionsPublished4 days agoFull race resultsRussell, already on the edge after he was given soft tyres for the final stint after the safety car, spent the final stint managing an electrical issue that was causing systems failures in the car.It affected the brake-by-wire system, which also prevents the car recovering energy from the rear axle.That meant he had to reset the systems several times a lap, which led to an error in which he used the DRS when he was not meant to. It came about because he was not aware that the back-up button in question would operate the DRS at that time. Russell was not penalised because of the combination of circumstances that led to the error and because he slowed at the following corner to more than give back the small gain he received."it was exceptionally difficult towards the end," Russell said. "I had all sorts of problems with the car. "The steering wheel, I was losing all my data and the brake pedal went into a failure mode, so I had to do all these resets. One minute the brakes were working properly, the next they weren't. "So I was pretty pleased when I saw the chequered flag."Behind the Ferraris, Verstappen was never a feature, the Red Bull's lack of pace and balance exposed on this track that has such a high demand on the tyres. Two slow pit stops delayed him, too, one caused by a problem with the traffic-light system, another by a problem with a front wheel.Gasly's seventh secured the first points for Alpine this season, while Esteban Ocon drove an outstanding race in the Haas to take eighth after a heavy crash in qualifying left him 15th on the grid.The second Haas of Oliver Bearman took 10th for the second race running, the two cars sandwiching the Red Bull of Yuki Tsunoda.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Russell was given credit for his performance by Mercedes boss Toto Wolff after electrical problems caused havoc with his carImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Bahrain is a twilight race, which produces spectacular sparking from cars under braking at Turn OneRelated topicsFormula 1Comments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 976Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9557 viewing9.6k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published13 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
