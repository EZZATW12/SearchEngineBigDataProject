I'm sorry for that.'"At the same time, I was five seconds late. And to be five seconds late and have to pay €10,000 or whatever the fine is, for me, it is out of the question that we are having to pay these fines."But yeah, I don't know if I'm going to get another fine for saying this, but s*** happens."This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, McLaren mistakes & Tsunoda vindication: What to know ahead of the Bahrain Grand PrixSainz's choice to employ a swear word in a news conference risks him being given a further fine by governing body the FIA, which over the winter changed the sport's rules to codify a series of penalties for swearing.The move followed Max Verstappen being forced to do the equivalent of community service for swearing in a news conference at the Singapore Grand Prix last September.Sainz is a director of the Grand Prix Drivers' Association and said before the start of the season that he thought fining drivers for swearing was wrong.His fellow GPDA director George Russell of Mercedes said: "It's a pretty expensive poo."Russell went on to express his frustration with the FIA, following the resignation on Thursday of the deputy president of sport, Robert Reid, in protest at the organisation's direction."We have been talking about this on and off for six months now," Russell said. "I don't want to give it any more air time from my personal perspective, because we have said everything we've had to say. Unfortunately, it has had little or no impact."We just want collaboration. It doesn't make any sense to be fighting on these topics."Sainz added:  "It's disappointing. I hope, as I've always said, I hope someone tells me where this €10K goes. And they say, 'OK, at least it went to a nice cause,' and I will be looking forward to seeing where they go."Related topicsFormula 1More on this storyFormer CEO breaks silence on FIA's 'serious challenges'Published10 AprilFIA executive Reid resigns over 'standards breakdown'Published10 AprilTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8820 viewing8.8k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published13 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
