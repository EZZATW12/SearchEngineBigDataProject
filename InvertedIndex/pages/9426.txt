McLaren's stop was faster by a second, and as they left the pits the McLaren was halfway alongside the Red Bull.But Verstappen held his line, and Norris ran out of track, taking to the grass.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, After the race, Max Verstappen joked "that's quite an expensive lawnmower" as he and Lando Norris watched the pit-lane incident togetherNorris complained about Verstappen's driving, saying he had been pushed off, while Verstappen countered by saying his rival had driven off by himself. The stewards agreed with the four-time world champion.After the race, Norris said: "He had the position and he had the right to do what he did, so fair play."From then on, Norris and Piastri tracked Verstappen for the final 32 laps, with just over two seconds separating them most of the time.But Norris could not get within a second of Verstappen, and in fact it was Piastri who looked to have the best pace, sometimes closing to within 0.5secs of his team-mate.Piastri suggested to the team that he felt he had the pace to beat Verstappen - a thinly veiled request to be let past.But McLaren did not interfere in their battle and the first three drivers crossed the line in the order they had held all race, separated by just 2.2 seconds.Piastri moves into third place in the championship ahead of Russell, and is 13 points behind his team-mate.Verstappen said: "It was tough, just pushing very hard on the last set. The two McLarens were pushing me very hard."I'm incredibly happy. It started off quite tough this weekend but we didn't give up, we carried on improving the car and today it was in its best form. Starting on pole was very important."Norris added: "The pace was too similar to do anything more. Long race, a lot of pushing, flat out from start to finish, but nothing special we had to get Max on. He deserved it."They were quick, they've made some improvements and we'll have to work hard."The top three were in a race of their own and the entire grand prix was pretty static in terms of order.Ferrari's Charles Leclerc held off Russell for fourth place, while the Briton's team-mate Andrea Kimi Antonelli put in a strong final stint to close to less than two seconds behind his team-mate.Italian Antonelli led the race after Verstappen, Norris and Piastri pitted and became the youngest driver in Formula 1 history to do so, at 18 years and 224 days. Verstappen was four days older when he won the 2016 Spanish Grand Prix. Antonelli also became the youngest driver to set the fastest lap, again beating Verstappen from the 2016 Brazilian Grand Prix. Lewis Hamilton, on an alternate tyre strategy, took seventh from eighth place on the grid, getting ahead of Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar early in the race. It was the only position change in the top 10.Alex Albon drove an attacking race, complaining to the Williams team about his strategy, to take ninth, ahead of the Haas of Briton Oliver Bearman.In his first race for Red Bull, Yuki Tsunoda finished 12th with the man he replaced, Liam Lawson, 17th in the Racing Bull.

He hasn't got the fastest car underneath him and we didn't expect him to win this race.I think Lando Norris will be thinking that he should have slotted right behind Verstappen [on the pit-stop exit]. He had a faster pit stop by a second compared to Verstappen. It could have been a different story to this race if Norris did slot in behind, he would have been only a couple of tenths behind down into Turn One.Related topicsFormula 1More on this storyProposal to bring back V10 engines set to be rejectedPublished4 AprilWhat's it like being a replacement F1 driver?Published2 AprilComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 1302Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8768 viewing8.8k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published13 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
