First came a diving effort in the corner after Bath's replacements had driven into the Falcons' half, with the second a mere stride over the line following Donoghue's charge down the wing.Josh Bayliss created Bath's seventh try, the back rower drawing the attention of three Falcons' defenders before feeding Hennessey, who sprinted up the touchline before diving flamboyantly over the line.With Bath again down to 14 following a deliberate knock-on from Bayliss, Redpath added an eighth, which was the signal for the celebrations to begin as Johann van Graan's side finish top of the table in the regular season for the first time since 2003-04.Bath head of rugby Johann van Graan told BBC Radio Bristol: "I thought the 23 produced some magic moments today. It wasn't perfect but it gives us five points and puts us in an unassailable home semi-final position, on the weekend of 7 June."A proud moment for the club, we'll enjoy tonight then go back to zero. Still loads to play for in between now and then but I'm proud of all involved.[On the moment he was most proud of in the match] "The last defensive set, defended our line, turned the ball over, see an opportunity to come and score 100 yards down the other end. I think that sums up this team - tough to beat. It's never done until it's done."Newcastle Falcons senior coach Alan Dickens told BBC Radio Newcastle:"I said it after the game last week, coming here is a challenge we'll look forward to and enjoy and relish in the week - which we did. "Unfortunately we didn't quite get that bonus-point fourth try."We were 17-5 down and we had the red card, the response they then showed for the next 15, 20 minutes to actually go in front was excellent."Disappointing that we missed a couple of tackles on [Ciaran] Donoghue, I thought he had a fantastic game and deservedly got man of the match. We really should have been putting [the tackles] down and who knows where we would have been."Bath: Emens, McConnochie, Redpath, Butt, Hennessey; Donoghue, Carr-Smith; Van Wyk, Annett, Stuart, Roux, Ewels, Hill, Underhill, Barbeary.Replacements: Dunn, Du Toit, Griffin, Bayliss, Pepper, Schreuder, Russell, Tuipolotu.Yellow card: Underhill, Redpath, Bayliss.Newcastle: Brown, Hearle, Doherty, Clark, Stevenson; Connon, Stuart; Brocklebank, Blamire, Palframan, Hawkins, De Chaves, Lockwood, Neild, Chick.Replacements: Fletcher, Rewcastle, McCallum, Usher, Leatherbarrow, Pepper, Spencer, Arnold.Red card: Brown.Referee: Craig Maxwell-KeysRelated topicsNewcastle FalconsRugby UnionBathComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 158Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8781 viewing8.8k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published13 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
