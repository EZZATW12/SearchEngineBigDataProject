Saracens hardly touched the ball until the eighth minute when Tom Willis went on a spectacular carry, bouncing off challenge after challenge before eventually losing the ball.Tom Roebuck and Ford combined in a lightning quick break which ended with the  England fly-half touching down between the posts for his first try - duly converted - since joining the Manchester club in 2022.Fergus Burke missed a penalty kick from 35 metres out with Sarries' first chance to get on the board.Minutes later Reed came up with the moment of the match as he picked up the ball in front of his own tryline and tore away at lightning pace.He dashed past Nick Tompkins, rode the challenge of Angus Hall, ran beyond Elliot Daly, and celebrated long before getting to the line knowing no-one could match his blistering speed.Hall ran in Saracens' first try in the right corner after a period of pressure from the visitors, finishing up after Daly's great, 20-yard pass.Hall was taken off for a head injury assessment (HIA) after a challenge at the start of the second half, with Alex Goode coming on in his place, and did not return to the field.The hosts were in full control after the break and Ford kicked between the posts to open up an 18-point lead, though how costly referee Ridley's mistake will prove for the Sharks is yet to be seen.The unsighted referee's decision to blow his whistle at what he thought was a Sale knock-on was all that stopped the Sharks from claiming a deserved bonus point, which would have moved them up to 49 points.On a forgettable night for Saracens, one positive was the performance of England number eight Tom Willis, who was applauded by both sets of fans when he was replaced in the second half.Sale have now won their past four Premiership matches and go into the run-in with momentum.They visit Leicester next in two weeks' time, while Saracens host bottom side Newcastle Falcons.Sanderson backs Ford for Lions selectionSale Sharks director of rugby Alex Sanderson said:"We were physical and really clinical at times – and we're exactly where we want to be since we started setting targets after the Six Nations."We've got to win every game but George Ford is like a coach on the field. He can manage games and he can break the game evidently from his performance tonight."People have put other fly-halves ahead of him because of their attacking, game-breaking prowess. But I think he showed tonight that he's got that in his game as well – what can't he do?"Are there three better fly-halves in Britain and Ireland than George? I don't think so. He's in a rich vein of form and he's taking his team with him – but it [Lions selection] is not down to me."Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall said: "Sale are a good team and really tough to play against."But when you don't have that momentum and speed of ball, we were 22-0 down and that's a mountain to climb."[On Tom Willis] "Tom has certainly grown up this season and for him to make the metres he made against a team like Sale, it takes some doing."For Tom to do some of the damage he did was outstanding and showed where he's at. I think he should definitely be in the conversation for Lions selection."Sale: Carpenter; Roebuck, R Du Preez, Ma'asi-White, Reed; Ford, Warr; Rodd, Cowan-Dickie, Opoku-Fordjour, Bamber, Andrews, Van Rhyn, T Curry, JL Du PreezReplacements: McIlroy, McIntyre, John, Beaumont, D Du Preez, Dugdale, Quirke, O'FlahertySaracens: Daly; Hall, Tompkins, Hartley, Segun; Burke, Van Zyl; Carre, George, Clarey, Itoje, Tizard, Isiekwe, Earl, WillisReplacements: Dan, Mawi, Beaton, McFarland, Onyeama-Christie, Gonzalez, Bracken, GoodeReferee: Christophe Ridley.Related topicsSaleSaracensRugby UnionComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 196Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8061 viewing8.1k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published13 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
