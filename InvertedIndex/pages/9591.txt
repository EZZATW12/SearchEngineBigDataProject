Scrum-half Alessandro Fusco hit back for the depleted hosts, feigning to pass then ducking in to score.Thomson knocked over another penalty soon after, but the lively Fusco also struck again squirting away from a driving maul for his second try.Early in the second half, Zebra stretched the visitors with some snappy passing, allowing full-back Jacopo Trulla to dot down.Edinburgh had been looking rather sluggish before prop Boan Venter bulldozed his way through two attempted tackles to reduce the deficit, with Thomson missing a straightforward conversion.Venter again demonstrated his raw power to create space where there had been none before stretching for the line. This time, Thomson added the extras to make it a one-point game.The visitors' momentum was then halted by a yellow card for Ben Muncaster, with two penalties from Giovanni Montemauri setting Zebre on course for a double over Edinburgh before the late intervention from Currie and Scott, leaving both sides feeling deflated at the final whistle.Glasgow suffer home defeat by powerful BullsPublished2 days agoLine-upsZebre: Trulla, Gregory, Paea, Mazza, Gesi, Da Re, Fusco; Fischetti, Di Bartolomeo, Hasa, Canali, Krumov, Ferrari, Stavile, Licata.Replacements: Bigi, Buonfiglio, Pitinari, Zambonin, Nasove, Garcia, Montemauri, Morisi.Edinburgh: Paterson, Graham, Currie, Lang, Brown, Thompson, Price; Venter, Harrison, Rae, Young, Skinner, Muncaster, Watson, Bradbury.Replacements: Morris, Hislop, Williams, Gilchrist, Douglas, Shiel, Scott, Tuipulotu.Related topicsEdinburghScottish RugbyRugby UnionTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8061 viewing8.1k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published13 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Scottish sportWhat is still to be decided as season reaches climax?League reconstruction - why, when & what might it look like?Scotland men's internationals to be shown live on BBCCommonwealth Games: Why is it so special to be part of Team Scotland?From titles to tinpottery - rank Scotland's top 10 clubsElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
