Luatua is one of Bristol's longest-serving players and is set to make his 150th appearance for the club this weekend away against Northampton. The 33-year-old joined the Bears in 2017 when they were still in the Championship and was the first signing director of rugby Pat Lam made for the club."He's been here as long as myself and he's been brilliant," Lam told BBC Radio Bristol."A lot of fans talk about him being the best signing and that's on the work that he's done on and off the field. He's a fantastic leader and he's captained the team 90 times, a high success rate. "Everyone looks up to him, the referees talk highly of him, opposition have a lot of respect for him. It's great that he's continuing his journey with us."New Zealand-born Luatua was capped 15 times by the All Blacks and switched allegiance to Samoa in 2022 going on to represent them eight times including at the 2023 World Cup. He has made 19 appearances for Bristol so far this season in all competitions, starting 13 of those matches."It's good to lock away another year. My family love it here, we love it here. What we're doing here as a team [I'm] very excited about that. Very happy to be staying on," Luatua said."The mind is still ticking over and what I like in these last couple of years that I'm still learning. I find that if I'm trying to figure out things on the field and learn as I go, then the excitement stays with me."Related topicsRugby UnionBristolTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8061 viewing8.1k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published13 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
