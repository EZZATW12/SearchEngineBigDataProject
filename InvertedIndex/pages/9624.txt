Sexton, who retired after the 2023 Rugby World Cup, played on two Lions tours in 2013 and 2017. The five-time Six Nations winner has been working with Ireland in a casual coaching capacity since last November's Autumn Nations Series and will take up a full-time position with the Irish Rugby Football Union from 1 August. His new role with the IRFU will involve coaching the senior men's team, while he will also work with various men's and women's age-grade sides. "I am hugely excited to continue the next chapter in my coaching journey with the British and Irish Lions and I would like to thank Andy for this incredible opportunity," said Sexton. "It promises to be an exciting tour to Australia and I know from experience the challenges that awaits us. "Playing for the Lions was a huge ambition of mine during my playing career and my memories of those Tours to Australia and New Zealand will stay with me forever."The British and Irish Lions will face Argentina in a send-off game in Dublin on 20 June before travelling to Australia. The three Tests against the Wallabies will take place on 19 July, 26 July and 2 August.

The 2018 world player of the year earned 118 Ireland caps and captained the team to a series win over the All Blacks in New Zealand in 2022 and the Six Nations Grand Slam in 2023."I coached Johnny for the very first time during the 2013 tour to Australia and the love that he had for the British and Irish Lions was reflected in how he operated on a daily basis," said Farrell, who also coached Sexton with Ireland. "His influence on that Lions team and that Series win, our only win in the last 24 years, cannot be underestimated."His fight and his dedication as a player is something that he will bring to this Lions Tour and I know that the players will relish his experience and expertise alongside all of our assistant coaches."Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Sexton started five Tests across the 2013 and 2017 Lions tours Last month, Farrell added Richard Wigglesworth, Simon Easterby, John Dalziel, Andrew Goodman and John Fogarty to his coaching ticket. Farrell described adding Sexton as a "significant coup". "It was clear from working together during the recent Autumn Nations Series that he has the talent and skillset to add to our coaching team with Ireland and I know how driven he is to add to the Lions, firstly this summer, and then on a full-time basis with Ireland later this year," added Farrell. IRFU performance director David Humphreys said he is "delighted" to have secured Sexton's services on a long-term basis. "I believe that he will play an important role in sharing his coaching insights with male and female players from the Age Grade system right up to the Ireland national teams," said Humphreys. "In formally welcoming Johnny to the IRFU I would also like to congratulate him on his selection with the British & Irish Lions. "I have no doubt that the experience gained on this tour will greatly benefit him as he begins his full-time coaching career in the months and years to come."Related topicsBritish & Irish LionsIrish RugbyNorthern Ireland SportRugby UnionComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 1273Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions7939 viewing7.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published13 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Northern Ireland sportThe 'rugby student' stepping up to lead IrelandPre-contract agreements - why are they different in NI?Record-breaker Dunlop 'breaks mould' of modern sporting heroesMeet Jude McAtamney - the New York Giants kicker from Derry Elsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
