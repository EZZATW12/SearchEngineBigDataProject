If there was a scoreboard for Leinster's last two-and-a-half games in the Champions Cup, that's how it would read. After swatting aside Bath in their final pool match, the Irish province thrashed Harlequins 62-0 in the last 16 and hammered Glasgow Warriors 52-0 in the quarter-finals.Now, Leo Cullen's side are just two wins away from their fifth European title. "We looked at the game last week and everyone got on Harlequins' back, but maybe it's not the opposition," former Ireland full-back Rob Kearney said on Premier Sports."Maybe Leinster are going through a real purple patch at the moment where they are obliterating the opposition in front of them."Eight-try Leinster crush Glasgow to reach semi-finalsPublished11 AprilLeinster hammer Glasgow to make Champions Cup semis - as it happenedThe game in Dublin was effectively over after 25 minutes, and questions turned to if Leinster could 'nil' a team for the second time in a week.It wasn't just a yes, but a resounding one. Even in the 79th minute, 52 points and eight tries to the good, the blitz defence was racing up on the Glasgow line like it was the second minute. As head coach Cullen said: "This group is hungry and motivated and that's what we want to see".Spearheaded by the impressive Sam Prendergast, Leinster will now face either Northampton or Castres in the semi-finals, and on the evidence of the last two weeks they will be favourites to reach the final.However, there is one lingering question over Leinster - and that's the ability in the biggest moments. It's strange to say it for a team littered with Ireland, South Africa and New Zealand internationals, but their trophy 'drought' stretches back four years. They have lost the last three European finals, and haven't even lifted the domestic United Rugby Championship title in that time. That could cause natural worry as another potential decider looms ever-closer, but former Leinster and Ireland fly-half Ian Madigan says "this year feels different".Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Andrew Porter and Dan Sheehan - both tipped to be Lions in the summer - came off the bench to highlights Leinster's squad depth"This squad is just so hungry for that fifth star. When you lose three finals you can't help but be a bit anxious," Madigan added on Premier Sports."There are still quality teams left in the competition but Leinster's game is grounded on their defence now."In previous years you wouldn't have said that. They would have always backed their attack, but now there is this total belief in their defence."Madigan feels there are still a few teams who could hurt his former side.He added: "I think Toulouse or Bordeaux on their day can unlock it, but it's such an impressive and relentless defence. "It's by no means done but they have got themselves into a great position."Leinster's cause is aided by a fully fit squad, while holders Toulouse will be without talismanic scrum-half Antoine Dupont, who was injured against Ireland in the Six Nations. If any year is going to be theirs, this feels like it will be the one.When asked if Leinster were worried about complacency, All Black Jordie Barrett said: "It can, but that was our challenge. If you care enough then you won't let that be."On Friday's evidence, this team care more than enough.What's changed for Leinster?For Leinster, there are a pair of standout reasons as to why they are stronger than their competition.The first is the on-field recruitment. World Cup-winning second row RG Snyman was pinched from rivals Munster this summer, while Barrett signed a short-term deal from November until the end of the season and prop Rabah Slimani became the club's first France international.Barrett was named player of the match against Glasgow, and it was not hard to see why. He was instrumental in everything about Leinster's win, with the highlight coming when he picked fly-half Adam Hastings up like a bag of shopping and threw him into touch. The other reason is the arrival of Jacques Nienaber into the coaching set-up last season. Another World Cup winner with the Springboks, he has been the driving force behind the side's new defensive system.All of this, combined with Leinster's star-studded Irish line-up, has made the perfect recipe. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, RG Snyman and Jordie Barrett have added more winning expertise to Leinster's embarrassment of richesKearney added that the introduction of Barrett has added "another dimension" to the Irish province."You look at the three guys who have come in this year," he said."Barrett is really popular with the guys and has fitted in. On the field, he is doing things that New Zealand All Blacks do. "With Nienaber coming in there's a real team ethos and that South African strategy of the bench being important and strong, Leinster are now viewing games as a real 23-man effort."With their place in the last-four secure, Leinster can enjoy their weekend and watch their rivals battle it out for the remaining semi-final spots. They're sitting pretty both domestically and in Europe, and on current form it's hard to argue against them ending their run without silverware.Related topicsIrish RugbyRugby UnionComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 196Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions7939 viewing7.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published13 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Northern Ireland sportThe 'rugby student' stepping up to lead IrelandPre-contract agreements - why are they different in NI?Record-breaker Dunlop 'breaks mould' of modern sporting heroesMeet Jude McAtamney - the New York Giants kicker from Derry Elsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
