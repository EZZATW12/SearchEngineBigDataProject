It's a real pinch-yourself moment."Even from our first meeting as coaches you could feel the energy in the room and it is hugely exciting to work with these guys."Lions may strike deal for Top 14 stars – FarrellPublished26 MarchLions coaches specialO'Connell to lead Ireland on summer tourPublished26 MarchThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Barclay & Warburton pick Lions XVs after Six NationsWelsh strength and conditioning expert Aled Walters was confirmed as part of the Lions' wider support staff in January, along with analyst Vinny Hammond, who works alongside Walters in the Ireland camp.David Nucifora, who was named as the Lions' performance manager at the same time, worked with Ireland for a decade before taking on a role with Scotland in 2024.Easterby said that the draw of working with a unique set of players convinced him to accept Farrell's invitiation, rather than stay on with Ireland for their summer fixtures, expected to be against Georgia and Portugal."To tour as a player and now as a coach, knowing the group of players that we have the potential of working with, is something that I can't wait to get stuck into," he said."A Lions tour also gives you the opportunity to work with people you haven't before."Farrell will pick his playing squad on 8 May and the Lions will play Argentina in Dublin on 20 June, before their first game on Australian soil against Western Force on 28 June.The first Test against the Wallabies will take place on 19 July in Brisbane, with the series continuing in Melbourne and Sydney over the following two weeks.The Wallabies are ranked eighth in the world, below Ireland, England and Scotland.However, they claimed an impressive victory over England at Twickenham during their recent autumn tour of the northern hemisphere and their four regional sides made a strong start to their Super Rugby Pacific campaigns.Tickets for the series have sold fast with more than 500,000 people expected to watch the nine matches across six Australian cities. The second Test in Melbourne, staged at the MCG, is likely to be the largest ever crowd for a Lions Test with the venue capable of holding more than 100,000 spectators.Listen: Sport's Strangest Crimes - BloodgateListen to the latest Rugby Union Weekly podcastBlood brothers - bonds and betrayal on a rugby pitchPublished24 MarchLions CEO confirms interest in possible France fixtureImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, A Lions fixture against France would generate huge interest on both sides of the ChannelThe Lions are reportedly exploring the possibility of playing warm-up matches against France before their women's and men's side tour New Zealand in 2027 and 2029., externalThe Lions have faced France only once before, crossing the Channel for a 1989 fixture that commemorated the bicentenary of the French Revolution."I saw that speculation in the press this morning and it is probably not right for me to comment on specific details," Lions chief executive Ben Calveley told BBC Radio 4's Today programme."But what I would say is that we the Lions have a really strong relationship with the countries we have toured historically, but we are very interested in broadening that footprint and building a relationship in new territories."That's part of the reason why we are playing Argentina this time around, we played against Japan before we toured South Africa four years ago."So these sorts of opportunities are really interesting to us."Related topicsScottish RugbyWelsh RugbyBritish & Irish LionsIrish RugbyRugby UnionEnglish RugbyComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 519Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8296 viewing8.3k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published13 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
