The British public don't really know much about him yet but he's going to be, I think, one of the best players in the world."Cam's been up there too and he can do that as well, so I think it's really exciting for British tennis and good healthy competition for us."Draper bounced back from his disappointing defeat by Alejandro Davidovich Fokina in Monte Carlo to set up a meeting with former Wimbledon finalist Matteo Berrettini of Italy in round three.The 23-year-old broke to lead 4-2 on his way to taking the first set in just over half an hour, and an early break put him in control of the second on his way to victory in an hour and 15 minutes."I'm still relatively new to the clay so I knew it was going to be a tough challenge," he added."Everything was ticking over really nicely so I hope I can carry on gaining more and more confidence and getting more and more effective on this surface."Fearnley said he felt he had been playing some of his "worst tennis" in the first set - then twisted his ankle."It actually helped, believe it or not. The doctor gave me some painkillers and I was serving that last set some of the best I've served in a long time," he said."As of now I think my body is in a good position."It was his fourth match of the tournament after coming through qualifying, and he added: "The more I play these big matches, these big tournaments and get used to these surroundings, the better I handle them and the better I play."Related topicsTennisMore on this storyLive scores, results and order of playGet tennis news sent straight to your phonePublished31 JanuaryTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9638 viewing9.6k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published13 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
