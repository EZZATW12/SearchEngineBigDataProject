Hopefully it will pass pretty quickly."It's maybe one of my favourite wins. I was feeling absolutely terrible, I wasn't sure I was going to play, I had no energy, didn't sleep at all last night. "I started very low energy, sleeping on the court still. I had to create my own energy. He actually played really well, I know he's a really good player, so I had to fight every point."Norrie will face 26th seed Jiri Lehecka of the Czech Republic in the second round.Later on Thursday British number two Jacob Fearnley joined Norrie in the second round with a 6-3 7-6 (7-2) defeat of China's Yunchaokete Bu.Fearnley will face Tomas Machac of the Czech Republic in the next round after the 19th seed received a bye in the first.Related topicsTennisSwiatek digs deep to escape another Eala shockPublished3 days agoMore on this storyLive scores, results and order of playGet tennis news sent straight to your phonePublished31 JanuaryTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8837 viewing8.8k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published13 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
