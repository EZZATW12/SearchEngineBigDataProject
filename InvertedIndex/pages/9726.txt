"He doesn't deserve any of the hate he gets."After losing early at the Monte Carlo Masters, world number six Draper went looking for practice partners on the clay and Sinner - who he has played doubles with in the past - was an obvious choice."I knew Jannik was available and in Monte Carlo on the clay so we organised with his team to go out there for three or four days and train with him," Draper said."If you're going to train with anyone it has got to be the best in the world, right?"He's obviously had a bit of time off but he's playing at an incredible level still."It was great to be around him for a few days and get some good sparring."The British men's number one added: "I'm looking forward to having him back on the tour because I think his presence has been missed."Related topicsTennisMore on this storyLive scores, results and order of playGet tennis news sent straight to your phonePublished31 JanuaryTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8837 viewing8.8k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published13 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
