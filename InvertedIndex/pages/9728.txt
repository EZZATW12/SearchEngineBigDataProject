The 21-year-old Dane has finally got his hands on another ATP trophy after beating childhood friend Carlos Alcaraz to the Barcelona title.The reward is a leap back into the world's top 10 - as well as the customary jump into the pool.Alexander Zverev may not have made the most of chasing down banned world number one Jannik Sinner, but the German ensured he did not lose any further ground - and moved back above Alcaraz to number two - after claiming the Munich title. Hungary's Fabian Marozsan has broken back into the top 60 after reaching his first ATP semi-final.In the WTA rankings, Ostapenko has made the most notable progress after lifting the Stuttgart title.The Latvian, who beat world number one Aryna Sabalenka in Monday's final, has climbed back into the top 20.Elina Svitolina is just out of Ostapenko's reach after the Ukrainian won the Rouen title, with beaten finalist Olga Danilovic set to move up to a career-high 34th.The world's best have converged on Madrid for the next ATP Masters-WTA 1000 combined event of the season.Nineteen of the top 20 men are playing - only Jannik Sinner remains missing - with two-time champion Carlos Alcaraz classed as the favourite on a faster clay surface where the balls usually travel quicker because of Madrid's altitude.Russia's Andrey Rublev is the defending champion.All of the women's top 20 are set to compete in the Spanish capital.Swiatek defends her title as she looks to bounce back and close the gap on Sabalenka at the top of the rankings.Sabalenka might not yet have mastered the clay courts like she has the hard courts - but her two titles on the red dirt have both come in - you've guessed it - Madrid.British number ones Jack Draper and Katie Boulter took to the practice courts last week instead of playing in tournaments before Madrid, while Emma Raducanu has spent time doing a training block in Los Angeles. The trio will return to competitive action in Madrid this week.In the men's doubles, Joe Salisbury and Neal Skupski missed out on their first title together - but there was still a British champion in Barcelona.Luke Johnson and Dutch partner Sander Arends took the trophy after a tight 6-3 6-7 10-6 win over Salisbury and Skupski.Three British players - Eden Silva, Emily Appleton and Maia Lumsden - competed in the Rouen women's doubles main draw, but lost their respective matches.And what about the next generation? Junior US Open champion Mika Stojsavljevic won the under-18 girls' title at the National Championships, while Oliver Bonding claimed the boys' event.Both winners are rewarded with wildcards into Wimbledon qualifying and a place in the main draw of the Junior Championships.What is Second Serve?With so many professional tennis tournaments taking place across the world, and across so many levels, it can be hard to keep up with everything from one week to the next.As part of BBC Sport's commitment to offer more for tennis fans, Second Serve will be your weekly round-up of the biggest stories in the sport.As well as the main talking point, you can see which ATP and WTA players are making significant progress - or struggling for form, how the British contingent are doing and what the next stops on the calendars are.You can also sign up to get the latest tennis news from BBC Sport delivered straight to your mobile phone.
