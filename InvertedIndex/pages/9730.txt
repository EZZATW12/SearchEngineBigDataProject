"I didn't know if I needed to quit or if I was losing my passion."Alcaraz also speaks about the impact of his 2023 French Open semi-final defeat by Novak Djokovic, after which he decided to go on holiday to Ibiza."I wanted to go there basically to just get wasted," he says. "I made the most of it because I knew I might not get another three days like that. When I got back, of course, I won Queen's and Wimbledon. "I'm not saying partying helped me win, but taking that time off was good for me."Alcaraz returned to Ibiza last year, against advice from his agent Albert Molina Lopez and coach Juan Carlos Ferrero. Soon afterwards, his Queen's title defence was ended in the second round by Britain's Jack Draper - although Alcaraz went on to beat Djokovic in the Wimbledon final later that month."We all knew amongst ourselves that he shouldn't have gone to Ibiza," says Ferrero.The former world number one, who previously coached Alexander Zverev, appears frustrated with his protege at times."We are here to create the greatest player because of his abilities and opportunities," he says. "But if he's not that determined, [if] he's OK with being ranked number 15 in the world, then we'll lower our expectations."But knowing the way I am, I think it would be very hard for me to keep working with him."In the final scenes, Alcaraz wonders whether he has "the mindset" to "become the greatest player in history"."Well, right now, I don't know," he says. "I'm still young, I have a lot ahead of me, but from what I've lived so far, I definitely prefer to put happiness before any kind of accomplishment."Being happy is an accomplishment and happiness isn't always easy to find."Related topicsTennisMore on this storyLive scores, results and order of playGet tennis news sent straight to your phonePublished31 JanuaryTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8837 viewing8.8k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published13 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
