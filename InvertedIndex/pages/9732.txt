The Pole was joined in the third round by Coco Gauff, who overcame a disastrous first set to beat Ukraine's Dayana Yastremska 0-6 6-2 7-5.The world number four will face the unseeded Ann Li in an all-American affair in the third round.Australian Open champion Madison Keys defeated Lucia Bronzetti 6-4 6-3 to reach the last 32, where she will play Anna Kalinskaya.Stuttgart champion Jelena Ostapenko suffered a shock 7-6 (7-2) 6-2 loss to fellow Latvian Anastasija Sevastova, who is making her second comeback in three years following maternity leave and a serious knee injury.Related topicsTennisMore on this storyLive scores, results and order of playGet tennis news sent straight to your phonePublished31 JanuaryTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8837 viewing8.8k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published13 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
