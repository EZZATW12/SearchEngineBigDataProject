"I felt my level last year was really improving. I got unlucky not to beat [Paula] Badosa in the first round of the French Open - and I felt I deserved more from last season."Sinner does not deserve any hate - DraperPublished5 days agoRaducanu happy with 'informal' coaching set-upPublished6 days agoThe curious case of Swiatek's hex against Ostapenko - Second ServePublished7 days agoBoulter's reward is a second-round match against Italian sixth seed Jasmine Paolini, who reached the French Open final last year."I hope I can show that - even if not this week or next week - I can play well on clay," she added."You see a lot of big ball-strikers playing well and I asked myself why it can't be me."Meanwhile, British number five Francesca Jones moved into the main draw after winning her second qualifying match.Jones, playing in her second event since collapsing on court this month, won 7-6 (7-3) 3-6 6-1 against Spain's Cristina Bucsa.It will be the first time the 24-year-old plays in the main draw of a WTA 1000 tournament - the most prestigious outside of the four majors.Boost for Boulter in battle for British number oneVictory for Boulter comes as she battles to keep the British number one ranking with Emma Raducanu and Sonay Kartal closing in.Boulter has been the nation's leading women's player since June 2023, but has dropped down the world rankings in a stop-start season.Raducanu is up to 49th after reaching the Miami quarter-finals last month, while Kartal's rapid rise has moved her up to 60th.Both play their Madrid first-round matches on Wednesday."I don't feel any pressure at all," Boulter told BBC Sport before beating Siniakova."I'm very comfortable in the seat that I am and I know that every single person has a different journey and my journey is not going to be compared to anyone else's - I'm proud of that."I've been the British number one for two years, it's been a fair while now. It's something which I'm quite used to."After winning one and losing one of her Billie Jean King Cup singles matches last week on indoor clay in the Netherlands, Boulter went to Alicante - where her fiance Alex de Minaur has long been based - for a training week.She decided that was the sensible option - instead of squeezing in another WTA clay-court event before Madrid - as she continues to manage a foot injury.The issue has left her only able to play five tournaments this season, missing almost two months of the WTA Tour between the Australian Open in January and Indian Wells in March."I want to see the girls going higher and higher [in the rankings], but personally I have my own goals and try to focus on those a lot," added Boulter, who secured GB's place in the Billie Jean King Cup Finals alongside Jodie Burrage in the deciding doubles."For me I just need to try and stay healthy. That's that most important thing and then the ranking will take care of itself."Related topicsTennisMore on this storyLive scores, results and order of playGet tennis news sent straight to your phonePublished31 JanuaryComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 141Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8837 viewing8.8k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published13 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
