It is not clear if the spectator was ejected from the stadium. In January, Zverev was heckled by a spectator during the Australian Open men's singles trophy ceremony. As he stepped up to receive his runners-up trophy, a spectator loudly shouted: "Australia believes Olya and Brenda."The 27-year-old was accused of violence by his former girlfriend Olya Sharypova in 2020 and of domestic abuse in 2023 by Brenda Patea, with whom he has a child.Zverev has repeatedly denied both sets of allegations and a Berlin court case brought by Patea was discontinued last year. Zverev won the match on Friday against Griekspoor 6-7(6) 7-6(3) 6-4. He will face Hungary's Fabian Marozsan in the semi-final on Saturday.What's the background?In October 2020, former girlfriend Sharypova accused Zverev of violence and emotional abuse during their relationship. Zverev denied the allegations and said they were "unfounded".Sharypova did not press charges, and a 15-month investigation by the men's ATP Tour found there was "insufficient evidence" to substantiate claims made by Sharypova and so Zverev did not face disciplinary action.In November 2023, Zverev was given a penalty order and fined by a German court after being accused of physically abusing his ex-girlfriend Patea.Zverev denied the claims and lodged an objection against the order, which resulted in a public trial.The trial was discontinued in June 2024 after a settlement was agreed between the defendant and the complainant.At the time, the court told BBC Sport: "The decision is not a verdict and it is not a decision about guilt or innocence."Related topicsTennisMore on this storyLive scores, results and order of playGet tennis news sent straight to your phonePublished31 JanuaryTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8837 viewing8.8k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published13 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
