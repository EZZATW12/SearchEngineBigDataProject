The 35-year-old says she has suffered from panic attacks because of the tour's decision to "protect" an unnamed senior official after their "conscious" attack on her. "I spoke about it openly and directly. I tried to seek protection and justice within the WTA," Tsurenko wrote."But in response, faced indifference and injustice, which led to a prolonged moral decline."Pain, fear, panic attacks, humiliation, withholding information, harassment of my team to silence me... and this isn't even the full list of what I've had to endure."My last chance to defend myself, to stand up for my rights, my dignity, and to prevent such acts of violence in sports is to seek justice in court."The WTA told BBC Sport that although the organisation has the "greatest sympathy for the challenges Tsurenko has faced", it is "disappointed" she is taking legal action. Tsurenko, who considered quitting tennis following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, has spoken regularly about the challenges of competing on the tour against the backdrop of the war. The Ukrainian, ranked 239th in the world, pulled out of a match in 2023 after suffering a panic attack following a conversation with the WTA leadership about its response to the war. She says the organisation has become a "terrifying and alien place". "The WTA tour refused to protect a woman, a player, a human being. Instead, the WTA tour chose to protect a person in a leadership position," wrote Tsurenko."I pray to God that no one will ever experience what I'm going through and that everyone is held accountable for their actions." What has the WTA said?The WTA has emphasised its position in opposing Russia's invasion and maintaining its support of Ukrainian athletes."From the outset, the WTA has been steadfast and clear in its condemnation of Russia's war on Ukraine and the actions of the Russian government against the Ukrainian people," the association said. "Consistent with our position, the WTA has taken numerous steps to assist our Ukrainian player members, who have faced great challenges as professional athletes. "The WTA has been equally clear that it was founded on principles of equality and non-discrimination and its rules provide that competitions are open to all women players who qualify based on their merit, and without discrimination. "Consistent with those principles, and in common with other tennis organizations, the WTA has taken the position that individual athletes should not be penalised for the actions of their governments."It added: "While the WTA has the greatest sympathy for the significant challenges that Ms Tsurenko and our other Ukrainian athletes have faced, we are disappointed that she has decided to engage in litigation to seek to hold the WTA responsible for her distress.  "At all times, the WTA and its management acted appropriately and in accordance with our rules, and we are confident that we will prevail in this litigation."Related topicsTennisKasatkina to represent Australia instead of RussiaPublished28 MarchMore on this storyLive scores, results and order of playGet tennis news sent straight to your phonePublished31 JanuaryTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9256 viewing9.3k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published13 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
