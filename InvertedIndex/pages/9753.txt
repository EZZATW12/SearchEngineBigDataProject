The 38-year-old claimed his final Grand Slam title there in 2022.Mauresmo said a ceremony would be held on Court Philippe Chatrier at the end of the day session on Sunday, 25 May."Rafa made history at Roland Garros and his 14 titles will perhaps remain unequalled," two-time major champion Mauresmo said."The idea is to have a vision for the future and also to celebrate those who thrilled us in the past."Nadal lost to eventual runner-up Alexander Zverev in his final French Open appearance last year.The tournament will also honour the retiring Richard Gasquet and 2000 champion Mary Pierce.The French Open - the second major of the year - takes place from 25 May-8 June.Prize money for the tournament has also increased by 5.21%, rising to 56.3 million euros (£48.35m).The men's semi-final will not begin before 19:00 local time, having started at 17:30 last year.French Tennis Federation president Gilles Moretton said the tournament would not replace line judges with electronic line calling.The French Open is the only one of the four majors that still has line judges, with Wimbledon bringing in electric line calling this year."I think we are right to keep our referees and linesmen at Roland Garros," Moretton said."The federation wants to keep our referees for as long as we can. I hope we'll be able to maintain it in our tournaments in the future."Related topicsTennisMore on this storyIs it time for French Open to use electronic line calls?Published24 May 2023Tsurenko to take legal action over WTA 'abuse'Published17 AprilWilliams 'would be banned for 20 years' for doping case like Sinner'sPublished17 AprilTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9622 viewing9.6k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published13 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
