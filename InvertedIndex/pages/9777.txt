why risks facing female athletes remainImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Emma Raducanu became emotional when she saw a 'fixated' man during her second-round match in Dubai on TuesdayJonathan JurejkoBBC Sport tennis news reporterPublished21 February 2025British tennis player Emma Raducanu hiding behind the umpire's chair after spotting a man who had "exhibited fixated behaviour" was a distressing scene.It provided a stark reminder of the dangers faced by female athletes on a regular basis.The man was detained by police following the incident at the Dubai Tennis Championships on Tuesday and given a restraining order."When you know it can get that far, that you feel a person is so obsessed with you, that they'll find a way into your court, it's very, very stressful," former Wimbledon champion Marion Bartoli told BBC Radio 5 Live.BBC Sport looks at why female athletes continue to hold fears, the security measures which are in place to protect them and what more can be done to ensure they feel safer.The 'extra risk' faced by female athletesApproximately one in five women experience stalking in their lifetime, according to the UK's Office of National Statistics.Being a well-known public personality increases exposure and a number of female tennis players have been subjected to predatory behaviour in recent years.Raducanu, 22, has previously been the victim of a stalker, with another man given a five-year restraining order in 2022 after he walked 23 miles to her home.Fellow British player Katie Boulter described to the Guardian last year, external how she had been followed by people in a car and on foot, while American players Danielle Collins, external and Sloane Stephens have also highlighted the harassment which they have faced.A man was charged last month with stalking American basketball player Caitlin Clark, while sprinter Gabby Thomas and rugby player Ilona Maher have recently spoken out about their fears.Bartoli recalled a similar harrowing experience during a match at the All England Club in 2007.Bartoli described how a man followed her throughout the British grass-court season, turning up at the Birmingham and Eastbourne events before pretending to be a member of the Wimbledon groundstaff to get nearer to her."He found a way to purchase the same kit and get himself into my courts," she added."I recognised him during my first-round match against Flavia Pennetta and I pointed it out straight away."I said he was not a groundsperson, he was not working there, he was someone who has been stalking me for three weeks."Stephanie Hilborne, the chief executive of the Women in Sport charity, told BBC Sport that "every single woman has a level of fear"."That's not restricted to the more visible women - but the more visible you are, the greater that risk is and feels," she said."In sport, we have the situation where your body is very much on show so it makes for extra risk."What happened to Raducanu in Dubai?Raducanu was approached by the man close to the Dubai tournament site on Monday - the day between her first-round and second-round matches.The 2021 US Open champion was given a letter by the man, which sources in Dubai told BBC Sport included his name and telephone number, that she opened later in her hotel.After Raducanu told the WTA about the incident, tournament security teams were notified on Tuesday afternoon.However, the man was still able to enter the small stadium where Raducanu played Karolina Muchova later that evening.Raducanu spotted him in the front rows of the stand behind the baseline and, having become visibly upset as she told the umpire what the issue was, the man was taken out by security.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Emma Raducanu alerted umpire Miriam Bley to the man in the crowdRaducanu managed to regain composure and resumed the match, which she went on to lose 7-6 (8-6) 6-4.On Tuesday, having left Dubai, she said she was "doing OK" after the "difficult circumstances".Mhairi Maclennan, a British long distance runner who is the co-founder of Kyniska Advocacy, which supports women and victims of abuse in sport, believes players in Raducanu's situation should leave court for an emotional welfare assessment."Speaking from my own experience, the psychological and emotional impact of something like that happening during a competition can completely derail you," Maclennan told BBC Radio 5 Live."What I would have liked to have seen in this instance, and others where an athlete has been visibly shaken, is that they pause the competition where possible. "In a tennis match, make sure she is able to go and see somebody."I'm not saying the result would have been different had she been able to come back later but it is about offering her a choice."How extra security did not stop 'deeply concerning' incidentAccording to the WTA, players are escorted to and from the match court by at least one security officer.Enhanced security is provided if a player has been the target of a credible threat.The WTA, which has a full-time security arm, says extra protection was given to Raducanu after her concerns were raised.Tournament sources insist "efforts" were made to identify the man before Raducanu's match.However, questions remain about how he was allowed to enter the stadium.Hilborne believes it is "deeply, deeply concerning" the man was able to get so close to Raducanu."I'm not sure what happened to the security in this instance but if an athlete has already reported someone, there should be absolutely no chance that very person can turn up in that very circumstance," she said."You would hope the seriousness of this situation, where a woman reports someone for that type of behaviour, means there is no chance of them getting through security."Dangers of 'inadvertently overexposing female athletes'The WTA says player welfare and safety is a top priority, adding that safeguarding is "an area in which we remain ever vigilant".  The governing body points to the "significant commitments" it has made to education and training, as well as increasing staff and resources in safeguarding."Our approach recognises that effective safeguarding is multifaceted and strongest when everyone involved in the game is invested and held to the same standards," the WTA said.A key concern for both Women in Sport and Kyniska Advocacy is the effect caused by elite female athletes being used as marketing tools to push the growth of women's sports."We need to stop inadvertently overexposing elite female athletes," said Hilborne."It is concerning is how much they are pushed to expose their personal lives through social media and are expected to put themselves at greater risk in order to generate more income for the sport."We need to be selling the skills and jeopardy of the game, rather than the individual lives."Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, In 1993, world number one Monica Seles was stabbed in the back on court at a WTA event in Hamburg by a crazed male fan - an incident which is still the most notorious act of violence towards a tennis playerAnti-misogyny policies, introduced as a condition of funding being given to sports, should also be mandatory, according to Women in Sport.It has demanded social media accounts spreading misogynistic messages to be deactivated and reiterated its call for an independent sporting regulator to handle reports of misogyny.Hilborne also wants men to "stand up with women to address the system"."When you get a brilliant tennis player like Emma who you want to celebrate, you don't want to deal with these negative aspects - you want to celebrate their play and the story of the sport," said Hilborne."But when this does happen, we're reminded there has not been enough action. It is unacceptable."Related topicsTennisMore on this storyLive scores, results and order of playGet tennis news sent straight to your phonePublished31 JanuaryTop storiesLive.Â Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9625 viewing9.6k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published13 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
