But Sabalenka clawed her way back, winning the second and third sets in tie-breaks to advance and leave Keys with a host of regrets."I think being able to take this and turn it into a positive is really possible," a sobbing Keys said then.Now, 16 months later, possibility has turned into reality. The American has clinched a maiden major title at the Australian Open - beating double-defending champion Sabalenka in the final.Her triumph comes just over seven years after she suffered a heavy defeat in the 2017 US Open final against Sloane Stephens.But those struggles are behind her. Keys, who turns 30 next month, beat three top-10 players on her way to the Melbourne title, looking composed and clutch in the key moments.BBC Sport takes a look at Keys' journey to Grand Slam glory.Superb Keys stuns Sabalenka to win Australian OpenPublished25 JanuaryKeys sheds 'heavy burden' to fulfil teenage expectationsPublished25 JanuaryKeys' road to Australian Open successImage source, Getty ImagesKeys arrived at the Australian Open on red-hot form, having beaten top seed Jessica Pegula to claim the Adelaide International title the previous week.She saved a match point against five-time Grand Slam champion and second seed Iga Swiatek in the semi-finals, before beating top seed Sabalenka on Saturday.It is the first time a player has beaten the world's top two en route to a major title since Svetlana Kuznetsova at the 2009 French Open.There were also impressive wins in the earlier rounds against former Wimbledon champion and seventh seed Elena Rybakina, 10th seed Danielle Collins and three-time Slam semi-finalist Elina Svitolina.Injuries forced Keys to 'rip things apart'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Keys retired at 5-5 in a deciding set against Jasmine Paolini in the fourth round of Wimbledon last yearKeys' success is all the more impressive considering her injury woes in 2024.The 29-year-old missed last year's Australian Open with a shoulder injury before a hamstring problem ended her Wimbledon run in the fourth round.Determined to keep competing, Keys - on the advice of her coach and now husband Bjorn Fratangelo - decided to make a change.Fratangelo convinced her to switch her Wilson racquets for Japanese brand Yonex - a swap he thought would limit her injuries. "I have no idea why I like this racquet, what it does, like, all the specifics of it. I just knew when I picked it up, it felt really good, and that was the winner," Keys told Bounces on Tuesday., externalAnd just before the pair got married in November, Fratangelo dragged a "kicking and screaming" Keys into reworking her service motion."If you are going to rip things apart, you might as well rip everything apart, right?" she said.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Fratangelo has been Keys' coach since 2023'I wouldn't be sitting here without therapy'In 2015, Keys reached the Australian Open semi-finals as a 19-year-old.With a powerful serve and big-hitting forehand, she was often compared with 23-time major singles winner Serena Williams., externalKeys has been a constant on the WTA Tour, winning nine titles and consistently going deep in majors, making six semi-final appearances before reaching the Melbourne final.After winning the trophy, she spoke about the benefits of therapy in helping her unburden herself."I had done it before, but it had always been too sports-specific," Keys said. "I finally got to the point where I was personally low enough that I was like, I don't really care if this [therapy] helps me perform, I just want to feel better."I honestly think had I not done that, then I wouldn't be sitting here."'It was never if, just when'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Madison Keys (left) was runner-up to Sloane Stephens at the 2017 US OpenStephens was one of the many players to congratulate Keys, who is a popular figure in the locker room."It was never if, just when. You deserve this and beyond," Stephens said on X.Former men's singles Wimbledon champion Pat Cash told BBC Radio 5 Live: "It is a case of potential fulfilled, isn't it? "When we first saw Madison Keys at the Australian Open, everybody thought that she would win a bunch of Grand Slams and she would be in amongst the bunch."She has done it the hard way."Related topicsTennisMore on this storyLive scores, results and order of playGet tennis news sent straight to your phonePublished31 JanuaryTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8778 viewing8.8k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published13 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
