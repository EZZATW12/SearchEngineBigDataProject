I've played against him when he's firing on all cylinders and it's not fun for me. It's fun for everyone else to watch but it's hard to beat."Would I be surprised if he started rattling [more majors] off? No. Am I going to be there to try and stop him? Absolutely."People from all walks of life reached out - McIlroyPublished4 days agoR&A 'would love' Trump's Turnberry to host OpenPublished6 days agoMcIlroy will have 'unfinished business' at Portrush OpenPublished6 days ago'I've got no problem if it's bad weather'McIlroy's next chance to add to his major tally comes next month in the US PGA Championship. It is being staged from 15-18 May at North Carolina's Quail Hollow - a course he has won at four times.He will then head to Oakmont in Pennsylvania from 12-15 June for the US Open. McIlroy has had six top-10 finishes in the tournament in the past six years, including being runner-up in the past two.And when he arrives on the Antrim coast for the 153rd staging of golf's oldest major from 17-20 July, he will find the vast majority of the record 278,000 spectators will be supporting both him and Ireland's Shane Lowry, who won the title the last time it was held on the Dunluce Links in 2019.The hype around McIlroy's return to the scene of one of his most disappointing major results - his first drive of the championship careered out of bounds as he posted a quadruple-bogey eight on the opening hole before going on to miss the halfway cut - has only been heightened since his win at Augusta National.Schauffele, who will return the Claret Jug to the R&A at the start of the week at Royal Portrush, is hoping to "use that to my advantage"."If I can cruise along and fly under the radar, that's exactly what I'll do," he added.The 31-year-old has drunk "wine and tequila" from the famous old trophy, which has spent most of the year with his parents because "dad definitely consumes more wine than I do".And the Californian is hoping for what he perceives to be traditional UK summer weather to buffet the course - lashing rain and howling wind - during the championship, as happened during his victory at Royal Troon last July."I'm from San Diego where [the wind] blows a blistering three miles an hour," he smiled."When I think of Open Championship golf, I don't think of it being sunny. I think of people wearing beanies hunkering down, trying everything they can with their caddie to overcome that war that you're at with the golf course."It's such a validating and rewarding feeling to do it. I've got no problem if it's bad weather."Related topicsGolfNorthern Ireland SportComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 237Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8937 viewing8.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
