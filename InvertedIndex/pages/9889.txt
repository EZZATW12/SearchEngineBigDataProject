McIlroy has returned home to Northern Ireland after skipping this week's RBC Heritage event on the PGA Tour following his career Grand Slam-clinching success at Augusta National. But Lowry says the five-time major winner will fly back to the United States in time for the team event, which begins on Thursday. "We'll be there," Lowry told Golfweek. "I talked to him [Wednesday] morning. We're good to go."To be honest, I didn't want him to feel like he had to play because of me."He's not letting me down if he wanted to take some time. He feels like he wants to get back out there."McIlroy and Lowry beat Chad Ramey and Martin Trainer in a play-off to win last year's Zurich Classic.McIlroy is also due to compete in the Truist Championship in Philadelphia between 8-11 May. He will then return to major action at the US PGA Championship on 15 May at Quail Hollow in North Carolina, a course where he was won four PGA Tour events.  The 35-year-old will attempt to win his third US PGA title after victories in 2012 and 2014.
