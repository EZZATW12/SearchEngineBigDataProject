She was also alongside Catriona Matthew for the epic win at Gleneagles six years ago.That was the most recent occasion when the UK has held a match that has never been more popular with golf fans. It was also held in Scotland at Loch Lomond in 2000 and Dalmahoy in 1992 as well as St Pierre in Wales in 1996.But despite a record 12 appearances for Europe by Dame Laura Davies, with a haul of 25 points (another record) and stalwart contributions from the likes of Reid and Trish Johnson (eight appearances) England has never hosted the Solheim Cup.The coming weeks are thought to be crucial in determining where the 2030 contest will be held, with a concerted effort to bring the match to England. The Grove in Hertfordshire is considered the most likely venue.'McIlroy in the conversation to be Europe's greatest golfer'Published15 AprilWorld Handicap System manipulators are cheats - R&APublished17 AprilThomas beats Novak in play-off to win RBC HeritagePublished20 April'I'm honoured to be a vice-captain'Any bid will require government funding and staging the Solheim Cup sits on the UK sports' major events hosting target list, which also includes the Fifa Women's World Cup in 2035.Only last month the outgoing chair of UK Sport Dame Katherine Grainger expressed frustration that Britain is not staging more major events over the coming decade."We don't want fallow years," she told BBC Sport. "After 2028, we don't really have anything named. That is quite a big gap."There are plenty of events that still are there for the taking. It's quite obvious why these mega-events are so important to the country, and yet maybe we haven't made the case clear."It will be at least a decade before the Ryder Cup could be staged in England - Bolton is staging an audacious bid to hold the 2035 match - so the time would appear ripe for the Solheim Cup to come to England for the first time.More immediately, Reid - surely a compelling candidate for the 2030 captaincy -  and Sweden's Caroline Hedwall have been announced as vice-captains to Nordqvist for the 2026 contest at Bernardus in the Netherlands."If the Solheim Cup is happening, I want to be there for Europe in whatever way I can contribute," said the 37-year-old Englishwoman, who is a seven-time winner on the Ladies European Tour and LPGA."Some of my fondest core memories have been during a Solheim Cup week and in that European team room. I am honoured that Anna asked me to be one of her vice-captains."I know she is going to be an amazing captain, and I am so happy that I will be there to support her and the team and to help in any way to make Anna and the team successful."Attention this week is firmly on the women's game, with the first major of the year, the Chevron Championship, being held at The Club at Carlton Woods near Houston in Texas.Charley Hull spearheads the British challenge. The 29-year-old Englishwoman has banked three top-11 finishes already this year.Ranked 10 in the world, the Kettering player is chasing her first major title in an event where world number one Nelly Korda will begin her title defence on Thursday.Related topicsGolfComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 152Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8845 viewing8.8k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
