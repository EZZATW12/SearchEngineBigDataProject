He wanted to emulate his idol, Tiger Woods. It might have seemed like the starry aspirations of youth, but 25 years later, his dreams have become reality. After first meeting McIlroy when he was just 10 years old, it has been a privilege to chronicle Rory's ascent from prodigious talent at Holywood Golf Club to global superstar, capturing some of the most defining moments of his remarkable journey.First impressions always resonate, and they've never faded.He was a grounded young man - blessed with extraordinary gifts, but also a boy who juggled schoolwork with relentless practice. His wonderful parents, Gerry and Rosie, provided unwavering support and tirelessly nurtured their son's ambitions.'He didn't shy away from Masters pain'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, After his collapse at the Masters, McIlroy bounced back to win the US Open in 2011 - on Father's Day, no less, with his father in attendanceFrom his amateur triumphs, like winning the Irish Amateur Close Championship at 15 and earning a silver medal at the 2007 Open as a teenager - to his first professional victory in 2009, Rory welcomed me and BBC Northern Ireland into his world. He often told me how much it meant to share his journey with the people back home, a connection to his roots that remains vital to him today.I still smile thinking of the time I gave Rory a lift home from the airport after the '07 Open. His enthusiasm was infectious as he recounted his best shots, and we ended up reliving them on the putting green his parents had built at their house. Those moments revealed the joy and passion that I think still define him.As Rory burst on to the global stage, we were there for his Masters debut in 2009 and, two years later, for the heart-wrenching collapse when he let a four-shot lead slip away on the final round at Augusta. Rory didn't shy away from the pain. Moments after finishing, he gave us a tearful interview, and just a week later, he opened up again at home in Northern Ireland for a special documentary. I'll never forget what he said - he was undeterred by the setback and confident a major win was near.True to his word, less than two months later, Rory silenced doubters with a record-breaking eight-shot victory at the US Open. It was Father's Day, and the footage we captured of Rory embracing his dad, Gerry, remains a treasured memory. Flying back to Northern Ireland with him after that triumph, I saw tears in his eyes as he spotted Holywood from the jet descending into Belfast City Airport. His emotion at bringing that trophy home was palpable.Masters & Slam success will 'free me up' - McIlroyPublished14 April'Incredible and unforgettable'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Stephen Watson first met Rory McIlroy as a 10-year-old when he was a talent at Holywood Golf ClubRory's ascent continued as he claimed three more major titles in rapid succession, granting us unparalleled access during his 2014 double-major season when he became the best golfer in the world.On the eve of that year's Open Championship, he joined me for a BBC television chat show alongside Northern Ireland's other major champions, Darren Clarke and Graeme McDowell. Coordinating their schedules with so much at stake was no small feat, but Rory's focus never wavered. After lots of laughs that night he went on to lift the Claret Jug. He also allowed us to film the tender moment when he presented the famous trophy to his mum, Rosie, as he had also done in 2011 with his first major silverware.What has struck me most about Rory is his resilience, both on and off the course. His ability to rebound from setbacks and navigate intense scrutiny, given his talent and the weight of history, has been nothing short of extraordinary.I've been immensely fortunate to have a front row seat to Rory's life, watching a boy with lofty dreams become, in my opinion, the greatest sporting icon the island of Ireland has ever produced.From that first meeting in Holywood to now witness him achieve history by winning the Masters to complete the Grand Slam has been an incredible and unforgettable experience.I have no doubt there's more of this amazing story to come.Related topicsGolfNorthern Ireland SportMore on this storyMcIlroy 'proud' as Masters play-off win seals career Grand Slam at lastPublished14 AprilHow coping with 'heartbreak' changed everything for McIlroy Published14 AprilI wondered if it would ever be my time - McIlroyPublished14 AprilRory McIlroy Completes Career Grand Slam with Masters VictoryNerves and cheers at McIlroy's hometown golf clubPublished14 AprilCharting McIlroy's rollercoaster ride to golfing greatnessPublished14 AprilSix key moments that won McIlroy the MastersPublished14 AprilTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8370 viewing8.4k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Northern Ireland sportThe 'rugby student' stepping up to lead IrelandPre-contract agreements - why are they different in NI?Record-breaker Dunlop 'breaks mould' of modern sporting heroesMeet Jude McAtamney - the New York Giants kicker from Derry Elsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
