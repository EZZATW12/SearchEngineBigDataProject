"It's the moment when you say it out loud, that's when you really realise what you've done."Image source, Jeremiah AzuImage caption, Azu's son was born just days before he became European indoor championAzu is revelling in the moment."I've loved every moment since being home. My family were there cheering me on when I walked into the house, just picking me up, throwing me around. It was just a big celebration."I want to go to the top. I want to win global titles. It just adds to that motivation."Before it was for my family. But now it's really for my own son and my wife and I think you can't really beat those motivations."'I'm just Jeremiah'The 23-year-old has never lacked confidence. He puts it down to his family's support and unshakeable belief in God.But there is a humility to him that perhaps does not show in his customary startline dances for the cameras.Two days after becoming European indoor champion over 60m last month, he was part of an event in Wales to mark Commonwealth Day. Long after the guests had gone, he remained behind to help tidy away the chairs.On the track, the results are starting to justify that confidence in himself.He won Olympic bronze in the men's 4x100m relay in Paris last summer and his world indoor title last month has further elevated his rising status in the sport."It's easy to be confident," he continues. "You can fake it."I've never been a fake confident person. I'm just Jeremiah. Some people think I am confident, over-confident, under-confident, whatever it is. But for me it's knowing that I'm able to do what I've always believed I can do.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The world indoor 60m gold was 23-year-old Azu's first global title"I've learnt how to win and I think that's important in athletics. Because in the final everyone's fast, everyone's talented, but it's who actually believes it."Who's got that ability to not panic? Who's got that ability to time their dip right? It's all these little things that just allow you to have that confidence to walk in with the trust in the training you've done and in the team around you and your coach."His new coach is now his old coach. He first worked with Helen James as a 17-year-old and, after a two-year spell under Marco Airale in Italy, Azu is back with James in Cardiff."The world's his oyster," she tells us. "He's going to go a long way further than this."So what next for Azu?His focus shifts to the upcoming outdoor season and a return to China for the start of the Diamond League and World Athletics Relays event in May.When he returns to the UK again, he will add more 200m events to his 100m programme in the hope of broadening his future medal prospects and helping increase his top-end speed.But he has more than one eye already on September's World Championships in Tokyo."Coming in as world indoor champion, now there's a bit more expectation," Azu says."But for me I'm not really doing this for anyone. I don't want to prove myself to anyone. I do this because I know I can do this. Because my ability shows me that I was born to do this."There is not a thing that I'm not going to do, there's not an exercise that I'm going to leave."I go into everything wanting to be the best. So I just continue with that mindset towards everything."Related topicsAthleticsWales SportTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9702 viewing9.7k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
