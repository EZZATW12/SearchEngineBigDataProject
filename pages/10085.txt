Only Eddy Merckx, widely regarded as the greatest cyclist of all time, with 19, and fellow Belgian great Roger de Vlaeminck (11) have more victories in these famous races.Victory in Belgium caps another stunning spring classics campaign by Pogacar, with the UAE Team Emirates-XRG rider also winning Strade Bianche and Fleche Wallonne, as well as narrowly finishing second in the Amstel Gold Race.Le Court had enjoyed two fifth-place finishes this spring in the Milan-San Remo and Tour of Flanders.But it was still a shock when the 29-year-old AG Insurance-Soudal rider came out on top in a four-way sprint for the line ahead of Dutch duo Puck Pieterse and Demi Vollering, and France's Cedrine Kerbaol."I can't believe it. On the climb to La Roche-aux-Faucons [13 km from the finish line], I was completely out of breath. So to win ahead of the stars of the peloton, I can't believe it," said Le Court - the first African winner of a Monument race.World champion Lotte Kopecky was fifth.Pogacar overcomes wet conditions to win Fleche Wallonne Published4 days agoPogacar & record-breaking Kopecky claim Tour of Flanders winsPublished6 AprilPogacar continues quest to be bestThe race was billed as a showdown between Pogacar and Olympic champion Remco Evenepoel, who won back-to-back Liege titles in 2022 and 2023 before suffering multiple bone fractures in a serious crash on a training ride last year.However, the Belgian struggled, caught out of position when Pogacar attacked and later dropped by the peloton on the final climb of the day.Instead it was the familiar sight of Pogacar mounting an attack no-one could match.Britain's Tom Pidcock attempted to bring him back alongside Healy but Pogacar built up a lead of 30 seconds within 5km and the gap kept growing.Ciccone and Julian Alaphilippe joined Pidcock and Healy but they could not get organised, with Ciccone and Healy eventually getting clear to compete for the two podium spots left. Pidcock finished ninth.In reality this was just about Pogacar's increasingly possible quest to rival Merckx's standing as the greatest.Pogacar is only the seventh rider to win three or more editions of Liege, the oldest of the Monuments, with Merckx holding the record of five wins.Mercx won five Tours de France - including 34 stages - five Giro d'Italia titles, one Vuelta a Espana and three world road crowns, as well as his 19 monuments.Pogacar has three Tour victories, including 17 stages, one Giro, one world title and nine monuments.Only Merckx (1974), Ireland's Stephan Roche (1987) and Pogacar (2024) have completed the triple crown of winning the Giro, Tour and world championship in the same year.Pogacar is unlikely to win as many Giro titles as Merckx, given the demands of targeting the Tour each year, but every other tally could well be in his sights. After he attempts to defend his Tour title in July, Pogacar will be heavily favoured to claim a 10th Monument before the season ends at Il Lombardia in October.Pogacar has won the last four consecutive editions of the one-day race in Italy and will be seeking to equal Fausto Coppi's record of five wins overall.Men's resultTadej Pogacar (Slo/UAE Team Emirates-XRG) 6hrs 0mins 9secsGiulio Ciccone (Ita/Lidl-Trek) +1min 03secsBen Healy (Ire/EF Education-EasyPost) Same timeSimone Velasco (Ita/XDS Astana Team) +1min 10secsThibau Nys (Bel/Lidl-Trek) Same timeAndrea Bagioli (Ita/Lidl-Trek)Daniel Martinez (Col/Red Bull-BORA-hansgrohe)Axel Laurance (Fra/Ineos Grenadiers)Tom Pidcock (GB/Q36.5 Pro Cycling Team)Neilson Powless (US/EF Education-EasyPost)Women's resultKim le Court (Mus/AG Insurance-Soudal) 4hrs 15mins 42secsPuck Pieterse (Ned/Fenix-Deceuninck) same timeDemi Vollering (Ned/ FDJ-Suez)Cedrine Kerbaol (Fra/ EF Education-Oatly)Lotte Kopecky (Bel/Team SD Worx-Protime) +24sMarlen Reusser (Swi/Movistar) same timeMary Niamh Fisher-Black (NZ/Lidl-Trek) Monica Trinca Colonel (Ita/Liv-Alula-Jayco)Katarzyna Anna Niewiadoma (Pol/Canyon-Sram Zondacrypto)Yara Kastelijn (Ned/Fenix-Deceuninck)Related topicsCyclingTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9644 viewing9.6k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
