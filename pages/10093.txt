He held the record as the most successful British rider in the Tour, before record stage winner Mark Cavendish surpassed him in 2009. In a statement British Cycling's chair Frank Slevin said:, external "We are deeply saddened to hear of the passing of British cycling legend Barry Hoban. "He was an extremely versatile and talented cyclist and a pioneering figure for British riders, alongside Tom Simpson, in the great European races such as the Tour de France. "His performances provided inspiration for multiple generations of cyclists which followed in his footsteps. Our thoughts go out to his family and friends."His 11 completed Tours were also the most for a British cyclist, until 2018 overall yellow jersey winner Geraint Thomas finished his 12th last season.Hoban was also the first Briton to win consecutive Tour stages, with Cavendish and Thomas again the only two to match the achievement since.He also won two Vuelta a España stages and remains the only British rider to win Gent-Wevelgem - a road race held in Belgium - beating one-day legends of the time Eddy Merckx and Roger de Vlaeminck.Hoban was born in Wakefield in 1940 and initially competed as a sprinter for his local club, Calder Clarion, before adding success on more varied terrain during his professional career. His first stage win of the Tour, in 1967, came when his close friend and compatriot Simpson died after collapsing during the previous stage on the gruelling Mont Ventoux climb.Hoban was allowed to cross the finish line alone in Simpson's memory. Following his retirement in 1980, Hoban married Simpson's widow Helen, whom he leaves behind, with daughter Daniella and two step daughters.Related topicsCyclingTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8831 viewing8.8k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
