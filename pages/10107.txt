The Public Prosecution Service will decide in the coming days what action should be taken."Cycling's world governing body the UCI said in a statement it will "explore, in conjunction with the competent authorities, all the legal channels at their disposal so that such behaviour is duly and severely punished".Van der Poel shrugged off the incident to win the Monument - one of the sport's big five one-day races - by more than a minute from his great rival Tadej Pogacar, the reigning Tour de France champion.The 30-year-old, who now has eight Monument wins, the same as Pogacar, has been involved in several incidents involving spectators in recent years.In December 2023, he spat at some spectators during a cyclocross race in the Netherlands, saying he had had enough of being booed and having liquid thrown at him.The following April, he had beer thrown at him during the Tour of Flanders, while in March of this year he was spat at during the E3 Saxo Classic in Belgium."Something should be done about it," he added on Sunday. "People spitting and throwing things, it's too much and I'm going to ask for action to be taken."Paris-Roubaix's route runs through the north of France and is estimated to draw about 500,000 spectators to watch on the side of the road.This year's edition was 259.2km (161 miles) long, with about one fifth of it taking place on cobbled roads and tracks.Related topicsCyclingTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8831 viewing8.8k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
