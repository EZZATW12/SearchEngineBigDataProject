He is only the third cyclist to win three straight Paris-Roubaix titles after France's Octave Lapize (1909-11) and Italy's Francesco Moser (1978-80)."It means a lot, it's such a hard race and I was really suffering," said Van der Poel."It's too bad that Tadej made this mistake in the corner but then I just had to go for it. It was still quite far to the finish line and it was really hard."Ferrand-Prevot wins women's Paris-Roubaix racePublished12 AprilVan der Poel wins thrilling Milan-San RemoPublished22 MarchPogacar & record-breaking Kopecky claim Tour of Flanders winsPublished6 AprilA familiar rivalry but on new terrainPogacar, 26, was riding his debut Paris-Roubaix, yet it was no surprise the world champion sparked the decisive move in the race.The three-time Tour de France winner attacked a group of favourites at the front with 71km to go and only Van der Poel, 30, was able to counter.The Dutchman stalled their progress to allow Alpecin-Deceuninck team-mate Jasper Philipsen to join before Philipsen slipped back 23km later.From there it seemed likely to come down to which rider had the most power left, but Van der Poel's superb bike-handling skills and Paris-Roubaix experience proved vital, with Pogacar taking the corner too quickly and sliding into the mud.While not a serious crash, it was too much of an advantage to cede, even with Van der Poel later suffering a puncture, and the Dutchman crossed the line just before Pogacar entered the velodrome, winning by one minute and 18 seconds.Denmark's Mads Pedersen won the sprint for third, holding off Belgians Wout van Aert and Florian Vermeersch. Britain's Fred Wright finished ninth."We all know what an incredible champion Tadej is - he was in his first Roubaix, it doesn't surprise me but it's also not normal, he's an exceptional talent," added Van der Poel."It would have been the two of us going to the velodome if he didn't make the mistake so I'll guess we'll see him back next year to take his revenge."Van der Poel now has eight wins across the five oldest and most prestigious 'Monument' races in men's cycling, drawing level again with Pogacar after the Slovenian claimed the Tour of Flanders last week.Only five riders have won more Monuments: Eddy Mercx (19), Roger de Vlaeminck (11) and Costante Girardengo, Fausto Coppi and Sean Kelly (nine).Van der Poel and Pogacar have won all three Monuments between them this year, though Pogacar will be heavily favoured in the remaining two - Liege-Bastogne-Liege and Il Lombardia.Pogacar has two Liege-Bastogne-Liege titles and has won the last four editions of Il Lombardia, with his climbing ability well suited to the hillier terrain of both races.Paris-Roubaix resultsMathieu van der Poel (Ned/Alpecin-Deceuninck) 5hrs 31mins 27secsTadej Pogacar (Slo/UAE Team Emirates-XRG) +1min 18secsMads Pedersen (Den/Lidl-Trek) +2mins 11secsWout van Aert (Bel/Team Visma-Lease a Bike) Same timeFlorian Vermeersch (Bel/UAE Team Emirates-XRG)Jonas Rutsch (Ger/Intermarche-Wanty) +3mins 46secsStefan Bissegger (Swi/Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) Same timeMarkus Hoelgaard (Nor/Uno-X Mobility)Fred Wright (GB/Bahrain Victorious) +4mins 35secsLaurenz Rex (Bel/Intermarche-Wanty) +4mins 36secsRelated topicsCyclingTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8793 viewing8.8k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
