Even US President Donald Trump expressed his surprise on social media, posting: "What is wrong with NFL owners - are they stupid?""Thank you God," Sanders wrote on social media when news of the pick came through. The Browns traded the 166th and 192nd overall picks to the Philadelphia Eagles to take Sanders with their seventh pick."We felt like he was a good, solid prospect at the most important position," Browns general manager Andrew Berry said."We felt it got to a point where he was probably mis-priced relative to the draft."He became the sixth quarterback picked in the draft - and the second by the Browns, after they also took Oregon's Dillon Gabriel in the third round.The Browns already had quarterbacks Deshaun Watson, Kenny Pickett and 40-year-old Super Bowl champion Joe Flacco on their roster - although Watson is injured and likely to miss next season.Sanders' father Deion played for several teams including the Dallas Cowboy and the San Francisco 49ers in a storied NFL career during which he played cornerback in defence as well as a kick returner and wide receiver on offence.He also played in the World Series - the pinnacle of baseball - for the Atlanta Braves in 1992.Titans select Ward first in NFL Draft but Sanders snubbedPublished3 days agoWhy 'nepo baby' and 'unicorn' have made NFL Draft so intriguingPublished4 days agoWhy was Sanders drafted so late?Analysis - Ben Collins, BBC SportSanders was the initial favourite to be the first overall pick in this year's draft but became its most polarising prospect.He played four seasons of college football, two apiece with Jackson State and Colorado, and had last season's best pass completion rate (74.0%).But as NFL teams stepped up their evaluation process from January, Sanders' draft stock began to fall.Despite his passing accuracy, at 6ft 1in Sanders is not the typical size for a quarterback and does not have elite arm strength.NFL scouts felt he holds on to the ball too long and has not got the athleticism to extend plays with his legs when under pressure.More red flags were raised about his demeanour in March as teams spoke with Sanders at the Scouting Combine, with one coach saying his team's chat with Sanders was "the worst formal interview I've ever been in"., externalSanders was described as "brash and arrogant",, external as well as "unprofessional and disinterested"., external Others felt he had a sense of entitlement and had been insulated, with his father having been his head coach throughout his college career.Deion is outspoken and said he would step in if the wrong team wanted to draft Shedeur, who is already a wealthy celebrity in his own right through NIL deals, and some teams thought it would all be too much of a distraction.Opinion was divided on Shedeur, even within NFL teams, and on multiple occasions every single team felt that drafting him was not worth the risk.By the time he had slid to the fifth round, Cleveland decided it was worth taking that chance.Related topicsAmerican FootballMore on this storyWho will be number one pick in the 2025 NFL draft?Published6 days agoGet American Football news sent straight to your phonePublished31 JanuaryTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8815 viewing8.8k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
