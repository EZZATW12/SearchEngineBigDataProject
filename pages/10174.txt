That was undoubtedly the loudest pick of the night as the Lambeau Field crowd went crazy.396Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharing'Best pure left tackle in the draft'published at 04:47 British Summer Time 25 April04:47 BST 25 AprilRob StatonBBC Radio Sheffield and NFL on 5 Live hostFor me, Josh Simmons is the best pure left tackle in the draft. He suffered a serious knee injury during the season which heavily impacted his stock. This is a great investment in a critical position for the Chiefs and he can be Patrick Mahomes' key pass-protector for years to come once he's fully healthy.239Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharing'We've got to win another Super Bowl next year. It's on!'published at 04:46 British Summer Time 25 April04:46 BST 25 AprilJihaad Campbell on being drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles: "It's a surreal moment. Shout-out to everybody back at home."Philly... y'all know what's up! We've got to turn up, we've got to get lit, we've got to win another Super Bowl next year. It's on!"Getting that call, just being here, was surreal. Maximising my opportunities when I was younger has led me to this point. I'm extremely grateful and I'm honoured."Told he'll have a future in television after he retires, he said: "You're damn right!"Image source, Getty Images1811Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingPick 32 - Chiefs select Josh Simmonspublished at 04:44 British Summer Time 25 April04:44 BST 25 AprilOffensive tackle - Ohio StateAnother one that's no real shock as the Kansas City Chiefs draft a player to try and protect Patrick Mahomes and improve that offensice line.That's really where they lost the Super Bowl, their offensive line just couldn't stand up to the Spurs pass rush during in the big game in New Orleans, so a big focus will be on beefing up the offensive line. 1135Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharing'Campbell a top-10 talent going at 31'published at 04:41 British Summer Time 25 April04:41 BST 25 AprilRob StatonBBC Radio Sheffield and NFL on 5 Live hostJihaad Campbell is a top-10 talent in this draft. The reason he lasted to the Eagles is purely due to injury. He had labrum surgery recently and might miss the start of the season. Without that issue he would've gone way earlier. He's a violent tackler who flies around the field and attacks the line of scrimmage as a blitzer.245Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingPick 31 - Eagles select Jihaad Campbellpublished at 04:39 British Summer Time 25 April04:39 BST 25 AprilLinebacker - AlabamaIt's a double edged sword being in the green room - as Jihaad Campbell has had to wait a long time but ends up being drafted by the Super Bowl champions!Philly's defence hardly looked like it needed strengthening last season but they could have yet another star on their hands if Campbell can convert his college form to the NFL.Doubts over his fitness after surgey meant he dropped down far further than he really should given his ability - and that's the typoe of signing that usually thrivers at Liverpool.1339Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharing'Truly a dream come true' for Hairstonpublished at 04:36 British Summer Time 25 April04:36 BST 25 AprilMaxwell Hairston on being drafted by the Buffalo Bills: "I can't believe what's going on right now. I'm so thankful, I'm so blessed. I'm so happy to hear my name called. It's truly a dream come true."111Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingTrade Alertpublished at 04:34 British Summer Time 25 April04:34 BST 25 AprilNot the biggest one by any means as the two Super Bowl teams do a deal to switch first round picks, as the Eagles move up one to 31 and are currently on the clock.The Chiefs move from 31 to 32 and will have the final pick of the draft.711Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingBest suit of the night?published at 04:33 British Summer Time 25 April04:33 BST 25 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesNow Maxwell Hairston gets the chance to show off his drip on the big stage.Asked about the pictures of his family on the lining of his jacket, he said: "They're with me everywhere I go. I love my family. They're my biggest support system."Image source, Getty Images132Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharing'Elite speed and a nose for the ball'published at 04:32 British Summer Time 25 April04:32 BST 25 AprilRob StatonBBC Radio Sheffield and NFL on 5 Live hostThere isn't a smoother cornerback in the draft than Maxwell Hairston. His transition and backpedal is like caramel and that's half the battle at his position. With elite speed and a nose for the ball, Hairston has so much potential.221Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingPick 30 - Bills select Maxwell Hairstonpublished at 04:32 British Summer Time 25 April04:32 BST 25 AprilCornerback - KentuckyA very happy Maxwell Hairston makes his way out of the green room to the stage to get his Buffalo Bills hat and jersey.The Bills ranked 29th on third down last year and having more skill at corner to prevent those conversions would be a big advantage.Having to usually deal with either Patrick Mahomes and/or Lamar Jackson in the play-offs means that the secondary has to be razor sharp to win thise big games.110Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharing'Best offensive lineman in draft?'published at 04:25 British Summer Time 25 April04:25 BST 25 AprilRob StatonBBC Radio Sheffield and NFL on 5 Live hostSome people think Josh Conerly Jr is the best offensive lineman in the draft. He's incredibly light on his feet and he can get on the move which helps with Jayden Daniels' mobility at quarterback. He can stand to get a little stronger at the point of contact though.237Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingPick 29 - Commanders select Josh Conerly Jrpublished at 04:24 British Summer Time 25 April04:24 BST 25 AprilOffensive tackle - OregonAll about protecting Jayden Daniels this one - and why not as Washington's first pick last year had an incredivle rookie season with the star QB almost leading them to the Super Bowl.And with the Commanders having to face the Eagles again twice next season and maybe in the play-offs again, they have to try and negate that interior pressure Philly can bring.412Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingPostpublished at 04:24 British Summer Time 25 April04:24 BST 25 AprilMalaki Starks on being drafted by the Baltimore Ravens: "I've been waiting for a long time in the room back there and I'm ready to go to work."I can't thank [my family] enough, all the sacrifices they've made for me - I told my dad I wouldn't dry! My agency bet on me and I bet on myself."Image source, Getty Images90Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharing'Williams can be big time for Lions'published at 04:22 British Summer Time 25 April04:22 BST 25 AprilRob StatonBBC Radio Sheffield and NFL on 5 Live hostIf he can just get a little lighter, Tyleik Williams can be a big time interior player. He's more athletic than he looks and he can be a three-down defender. For two years he shone for Ohio State and has flown a little under the radar as a possible first round pick.181Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingPick 28 - Lions select Tyleik Williamspublished at 04:17 British Summer Time 25 April04:17 BST 25 AprilDefensive tackle - Ohio StateAnother Buckeye off the board and one of the biggest with the sizeable defensive lineman joins Detroit.Predominantly a run stuffer, he's a tough individual and that's exactly what Dan Campbell loves in his Lions squad.122Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingGiants were a better fit for Dart than Sanders - Warnerpublished at 04:16 British Summer Time 25 April04:16 BST 25 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesHall of Fame quarterback Kurt Warner on the Giants drafting Jaxson Dart: "I think this is so much about style. He's not Josh Allen but think about what [Giants head coach] Brian Daboll did with Josh Allen."He wants a quarterback that can move - the designed runs, the movement scheme he likes to have. The second-level throws, which Josh Allen was so good at in Buffalo, is what separated Jaxson Dart. I thought he was the best intermediate thrower of this group of quarterbacks."We were wondering if Shedeur Sanders would be the guy but I just think that, what Brian Daboll wants to do style-wise, it more fits Jaxson Dart."153Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharing'Ravens nailed Starks pick'published at 04:14 British Summer Time 25 April04:14 BST 25 AprilRob StatonBBC Radio Sheffield and NFL on 5 Live hostThe Ravens make the right pick so often and they nailed this one. Malaki Starks is a perfect Raven. He fills a big need. He can play deep with the range to read and react and make plays on the ball. He's a rare safety and this is unbelievable value.262Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingPick 27 - Ravens select Malaki Starkspublished at 04:12 British Summer Time 25 April04:12 BST 25 AprilSafety - GeorgiaMalakai Starks finally makes his way out of the green room at Lambeau Field and gets to join up with the Baltimore Ravens.Starks has great hustle and chasing speed, while also an excellent tackler and by all accounts has strong leadership skills and versatility to operate around the secondary.Baltimore might have got a bit of a steal with this one.301Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingprevious pagePage 1 of 8123456…8next pageHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright © 2025 BBC.
