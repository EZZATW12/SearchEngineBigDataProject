He played 714 (87%) of their offensive snaps and 748 (83%) of their defensive.But few have played both regularly in the NFL. Chuck Bednarik is the last true two-way player, having played centre and linebacker for Philadelphia from 1949-56.Since 2006, Patrick Ricard is one of six players to have played 200 offensive and 200 defensive snaps, but the Baltimore full-back has seldom played on defence since 2019.William 'the Refrigerator' Perry, Troy Brown, Mike Vrabel and Julian Edelman also played both, but none did both regularly in the same season, as Sanders did with the Dallas Cowboys in 1996.After being drafted, Woodson played almost entirely on defence, and Sanders has told teams not to draft Hunter if they do not plan on giving him the chance to play both."They say nobody has ever done it the way I do it, but I tell them I'm just different," said Hunter.Is the NFL Combine sport's weirdest test?Published23 April 2019NFL Combine: ‘The Super Bowl of scouting events’ on the road to richesWhere will Hunter play in the NFL?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Deion Sanders was Travis Hunter's head coach throughout his college careerHunter says his role in the NFL is "still up in the air" and "up to the organisation" which drafts him, as each seems to have a different idea of how best to utilise him.The Tennessee Titans have the first pick of the Draft. Last week general manager Mike Borgonzi called Hunter "special", while head coach Brian Callahan said he is "unique".Both said they see Hunter starting as a cornerback, with Callahan adding: "Then you find ways to interject him into the offence as he gets more comfortable." He even suggested Hunter could also return punts.The Cleveland Browns have the second Draft pick, and general manager Andrew Berry said Hunter is "a unicorn" who would play "receiver primarily first".New England have the fourth pick, and their executive Eliot Wolf said: "He's probably going to major in one [position] and minor in the other."Hunter is adamant he wants to do both full-time, adding: "That's not my job to figure it out."Hunter averaged 111.5 snaps per game with Colorado - 40 more than the highest NFL snap count last season - but he hopes to emulate baseball star Ohtani and show that two-way players can "become a thing" in the NFL too."I do a lot of treatment," he said. "People don't get to see that part - what I do for my body to make sure I'm 100% each game."I did it at college level, where you rarely get breaks. There are a lot more breaks in the NFL, so I know I can do it."Related topicsAmerican FootballMore on this storyEnd of a dynasty?
