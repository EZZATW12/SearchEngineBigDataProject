and this year two Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks came on the market.Aaron Rodgers and Russell Wilson were both available, sparking weeks of speculation over where the two veterans would go next.Wilson's former team Seattle made the most big moves as they aim to usher in a new era.Elsewhere, a handful of teams have focused on rebuilding their offensive lines in readiness for the 2025 season, while stars such as Ja'Marr Chase and Myles Garrett are staying put after securing lucrative extensions.BBC Sport runs through some of the biggest deals from the free agency window.Seahawks sign Darnold & Kupp in revampImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Cooper Kupp claimed the receiving triple crown during the 2021 season, which ended with a Super Bowl winThe Seattle Seahawks had a positive first year under head coach Mike Macdonald - and British defensive coordinator Aden Durde - as they narrowly missed out on the play-offs.Now the Seahawks' front office has made some bold moves in a bid to truly move on from Pete Carroll's 14-year tenure and make this Macdonald's team.DK Metcalf requested a trade and Seattle sent the 27-year-old to the Pittsburgh Steelers on a deal worth $150m (£116.5m) - making him the NFL's fourth highest-paid wide receiver.Days later quarterback Geno Smith, 34, was traded to the Las Vegas Raiders and the Seahawks replaced him with Sam Darnold, 27, on a three-year, $100.5m (£78m) deal.Darnold has just enjoyed the best season of his career with the Minnesota Vikings and will link up with 31-year-old receiver Cooper Kupp, who was released by the Los Angeles Rams three years after being the Super Bowl MVP.Vikings, Patriots & Bears get young QBs some help Darnold was handed the starting role at Minnesota after last year's first-round draft pick JJ McCarthy got injured in pre-season.Darnold adjusted admirably to revive his career, but his position was always in doubt with McCarthy returning to full fitness.The Vikings let Darnold go and with McCarthy being on a rookie contract, they have spent big on bolstering their offensive line.The New England Patriots and Chicago Bears have done the same as they too have second-year quarterbacks in need of greater protection - Drake Maye and Caleb Williams, respectively.Wiliams, for example, was the number one pick in last year's draft but was sacked 68 times in his rookie season - 16 more than any other quarterback.The Tennessee Titans have the first pick in this year's draft and have also made big moves to reinforce their offensive line, suggesting they will take a quarterback next month - with Cam Ward the clear favourite.From 100-1 outsiders to unbeaten - how Vikings became NFL's feel-good storyPublished8 October 2024'Special talent' Williams shines in LondonPublished13 October 2024Chase & Garrett earn lucrative extensionsImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Ja'Marr Chase, Joe Burrow and Tee Higgins helped the Cincinnati Bengals reach the Super Bowl in 2022, where they lost to the Los Angeles RamsWhile the Cincinnati Bengals' offence produced an explosive end to the season, they left it too late to snatch a play-off spot.Ultimately it was their defence that let them down during a sluggish start, as quarterback Joe Burrow led the league for passing yards and touchdown passes, while Ja'Marr Chase earned the receiving triple crown.The Bengals were due contract decisions on Chase and fellow receiver Tee Higgins in the off-season and have doubled down on their attacking identity.They handed both four-year extensions, making Chase the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history on a deal worth $161m (£125m) while Higgins earned a $115m (£89m) deal.Myles Garrett and Maxx Crosby have also been rewarded handsomely for being two of the NFL's best pass rushers.Garrett requested a trade but the Cleveland Browns managed to agree a new $160 deal (£124m), while Crosby's new Raiders contract makes him the third highest-paid non-quarterback in average annual salary - behind Chase and Garrett.Bills quarterback Allen agrees record £255m contract extension Published10 MarchThe Draft 'unicorn' that NFL teams just can't figure outPublished3 MarchRodgers & Adams leave as Jets start over With the San Francisco 49ers preparing to offer quarterback Brock Purdy a long-term contract, they have let a lot of talent go to free up salary cap space.Versatile receiver Deebo Samuel is among those to leave, being traded to the Washington Commanders, so - after losing in two of the past six Super Bowls - the 49ers' championship window could now have closed.The New York Jets were billed as potential Super Bowl contenders last season having rebuilt their roster around Aaron Rodgers, the NFL's four-time Most Valuable Player, but the gamble did not pay off.The Jets have replaced the 41-year-old with former Chicago and Pittsburgh quarterback Justin Fields and released receiver Davante Adams, who was snapped up by the Rams to replace Kupp.Russell Wilson has left Pittsburgh to join the New York Giants, while a decision is still due from Rodgers, who has spoken to the Giants, Steelers and Vikings.The Indianapolis Colts have given Daniel Jones a chance to compete with Anthony Richardson for the starting role.In other big-name moves, New England signed receiver Stefon Diggs, Buffalo picked up ex-Chargers pass rusher Joey Bosa and the Baltimore Ravens have given Lamar Jackson another weapon by signing receiver DeAndre Hopkins.Related topicsAmerican FootballMore on this storyJets 'failed as a team' during Rodgers stint -
