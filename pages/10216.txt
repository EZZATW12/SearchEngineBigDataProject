What next for the Chiefs after Super Bowl blowout?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, What next for Travis Kelce, Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs after such a damaging Super Bowl defeat?Paul HighamBBC Sport journalistPublished11 February 2025301 CommentsThe Kansas City Chiefs went into Super Bowl 59 chasing greatness, but they came out of it with serious questions over whether their dynasty years have come to a devastatingly abrupt end.It was not losing to the Philadelphia Eagles, a team widely recognised as having the most talented roster in the NFL, that was the problem, but the manner of such a one-sided blowout.The 40-22 scoreline in New Orleans flattered the Chiefs. If the game was all but over at 24-0 when Kendrick Lamar performed the half-time show, it was definitely done and dusted at 34-0 in the third quarter.Only the Eagles taking their foot off the gas enabled Patrick Mahomes to avoid the ignominy of a first Super Bowl shutout. That would have been harsh on a team that came closer than any team before them to winning three in a row.So was it just a really bad day at the office or a sign that 'Chiefs Kingdom' is crumbling? Super Bowl 59 - As it happenedEagles demolish Chiefs to deny them Super Bowl three-peatPublished10 FebruaryWhy did the Chiefs lose Super Bowl so badly?This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Philadelphia Eagles destroy Kansas City Chiefs to win Super BowlThis battle was won and lost in the trenches, as so many are, with Philadelphia's defensive line bullying their opposition, leading to constant pressure on Mahomes - pressure he failed to handle.In terms of execution, Nick Sirianni's side produced their best performance of the season in the biggest game while the Chiefs saved their worst for last.Then there were the mistakes.Andy Reid's side built their season on winning 12 one-score games. That means stout defence, limiting turnovers and costly penalties, and making the most of the ball when they have it.They did the exact opposite in the Superdome on Sunday.A pair of Mahomes interceptions cost them 14 points, while penalties hurt them on Philadelphia's opening touchdown drive, erased a crucial sack on Jalen Hurts and chalked off a stunning Mahomes first-down run.Those types of errors were so unlike the Chiefs this season - and it cost them a shot at history.Mahomes failed to handle the pressureThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, 'It's the worst feeling in the world' - Mahomes on Super Bowl defeatPhiladelphia's defence was brilliant, especially up front as they sacked Mahomes six times, just one off the Super Bowl record, and had him under pressure from the first snap.It was a similar story in Mahomes' other Super Bowl loss, also a blowout against Tampa Bay, and maybe some demons from that game contributed as he had arguably the worst game of his career.Mahomes passed for a career-worst 33 yards in the first half as he failed to get the Chiefs into Philadelphia's half - and his total quarterback rating (QBR) of 11.4 was his second-worst in 133 career games.Yes, he was under constant pressure, but his decision-making was off. He was too quick to take off and run, perhaps understandably given how his offensive line was being manhandled.But his head was down, he missed some crucial throws - a possible Xavier Worthy touchdown and first-down conversion to Travis Kelce just two of them.Cutting a rabbit in the headlights figure was strange for a three-time champion and one of the best ever at the position."I just didn't play to my standard and I have to be better next time," admitted Mahomes. How he responds now could define his legacy.Eagles outclass Chiefs to win Super Bowl - in picturesPublished10 FebruaryWatch: Eagles celebrate Super Bowl win in locker roomPublished10 FebruaryWhy this could be the end of Chiefs dynastyThe Chiefs have been the dominant force in the NFL since Mahomes' first Super Bowl success in 2020 - in a league with everything set up to stop that happening it has been an impressive run.Getting so far each year means shorter off-seasons, lower draft picks and tougher fixtures - plus a huge target on your back each season.But both Mahomes and Travis Kelce had significant down years this year, with Taylor Swift's other half also now 35 and said to be mulling retirement.Head coach Reid is 66 and after a second Super Bowl blowout loss a significant rebuild could be in order - but they have some key members of the squad out of contract and money is tight in salary cap space.These things go in cycles and a 'Super Bowl window' is often mentioned as the perfect combination of established stars on manageable contracts combined with star draft picks all meshing at the right time.The Chiefs keeping that window open for this long has been special, but perhaps it is finally closing.Protecting Mahomes must be Chiefs' priorityImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Patrick Mahomes was sacked six times and hit 11 by the Eagles defence in Super Bowl 59Two Super Bowls have now been lost due to Kansas City not being able to protect Mahomes well enough. That now has to be a priority.Is the Chiefs' front office not bringing in the right draft picks and free agents? Is it a coaching blindspot on Reid's staff? These questions need answering.Mahomes was sacked and hit more times than any other season in his career, while the Chiefs now have the top two pressure rates allowed when not even being blitzed in Super Bowl history.That means the opposition can get to Mahomes without sending extra men so can still cover his receivers. It's a combination that will not only stop them winning more Super Bowls but also puts his health at risk.The Chiefs have a huge commodity at quarterback, it's time they started protecting their star asset.Why the Chiefs can bounce backSteve Spagnuolo's Chiefs defence was the only bright spot as they shackled Saquon Barkley. Yes, the Eagles scored 40 points, but the Chiefs' defence had some short fields to guard after turnovers and spending so long out there, the unit did well considering. So there could be an overreaction here. After all, the Chiefs have become a winning machine under Reid and Mahomes - getting to the AFC title game in seven straight years shows you that.Even after their 31-9 hammering in Super Bowl 55, their 'rebuilding year' was a 12-5 record and overtime defeat against Joe Burrow's Cincinnati Bengals in the AFC Championship.That was followed by one of Mahomes' most prolific seasons, a 14-3 record and the first of back-to-back Super Bowl wins in 2023 - so although this loss cuts deep, there is no need to hit the panic button just yet.Is there work to do? Absolutely. But everything we have seen so far from Reid and Mahomes suggests that is something they will really relish.It would be more of a surprise if the Chiefs were not right back in the thick of it next season.
