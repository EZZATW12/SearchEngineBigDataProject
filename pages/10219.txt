Louis Rees-Zammit has re-signed with his former team, the Jacksonville Jaguars.The 24-year-old is still fully committed to his dream of becoming an NFL player, having spent last year on the Jaguars' practice squad.The former Wales wing did not see any regular-season action in 2024, with his only appearances coming in pre-season games for his previous team, the Kansas City Chiefs.Now Rees-Zammit is back with the Jaguars, what does that mean for his future in the league?Rees-Zammit 'never thought about rugby return'Published18 FebruaryRees-Zammit re-signs as wide receiver for JaguarsPublished17 FebruaryGet American Football news sent straight to your phonePublished31 JanuaryWill he play in the NFL?It goes without saying that to play in the NFL, you need to have a team.With no regular-season snaps to his name, having signed a new deal with the Jaguars is a positive step for Rees-Zammit.However, it by no means guarantees him any regular-season game time.NFL franchises can have up to 90 players on their off-season rosters, a number which gets cut down to 53 before the start of the regular season in September.As part of the Jaguars' off-season roster, Rees-Zammit will be given the opportunity to impress in training camp and in pre-season games in August.The dates and opponents of the Jaguars' pre-season games will be announced in May.As well as featuring as a wide receiver, Rees-Zammit will be expected to impress on special teams.In the NFL, special teams plays are those involving kick-offs, punts and field goals.If the former Wales wing has any chance of making the Jaguars' regular-season roster of 53 players, he must prove himself to be an asset on such plays.As a graduate of the NFL's International Player Pathway (IPP), if Rees-Zammit ends up back on the Jaguars' practice squad, the franchise can elevate him to the active roster on three occasions during the regular season.But he has his sights set on a regular-season roster spot, and says he is "doing everything I can to make that happen".Competition for placesImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Brian Thomas Jr (left) caught five passes for 86 yards and a touchdown at Wembley against the New England Patriots in 2024Rees-Zammit is not the only wide receiver on the Jaguars' off-season roster who will be fighting tooth and nail for a regular-season spot.Brian Thomas Jr is the first-choice receiver on the team, following his extremely impressive 1,282 receiving yard rookie season.Christian Kirk, Gabe Davis, Josh Reynolds and Parker Washington add receiving options for quarterback Trevor Lawrence.The Jaguars also currently have wide receivers Devin Duvernay, Tim Jones, David White Jr, Joshua Cephus and Austin Trammell on their off-season roster.On average, NFL teams aim to have six wide receivers in their 53-man regular-season rosters, while some opt to choose five or seven.If the Jaguars plan to have six wide receivers on the roster come September, Rees-Zammit will have to prove himself to be more valuable than the other five depth options currently signed to the team.Proving himself to be a reliable kick returner would help his case, but veteran Duvernay held that role alongside Washington last season.How good are the Jacksonville Jaguars?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence was selected with the first overall pick in the 2021 NFL DraftThe Jaguars are coming off a season to forget in 2024, in which they won just four of their 17 games.The disappointment of that campaign has led to massive changes.The franchise are on the hunt for a new general manager, while they have already transformed their coaching set-up.New head coach Liam Coen, offensive co-ordinator Grant Udinski and defensive co-ordinator Anthony Campanile all arrive as highly respected figures.The appointments provide Jaguars fans with hope that the 2025 season can be a stepping stone towards future success.In quarterback Lawrence, the Jaguars have one of the most highly touted college prospects of all time.While Lawrence has not hit the heights that many had predicted, he still helped the Jaguars clinch their first AFC South title since 2017 back in 2022.During the play-offs of that season, Lawrence brought the Jaguars from 27-0 down to beat the Los Angeles Chargers 31-30.That win remains the third-biggest comeback in NFL play-off history.Under offensive-minded head coach Coen, Jaguars fans will hope Lawrence can replicate the form he showed in the second half of that game throughout the 2025 season.Related topicsAmerican FootballComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 278Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as
