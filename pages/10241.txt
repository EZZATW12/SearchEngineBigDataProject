Not Like Us, his brutal takedown of rap rival Drake, was one of last year's breakout hits, earning one billion streams on Spotify and five Grammy Awards, including song of the year.But there were questions over whether Lamar would play it - or even could play it - at the Super Bowl, after Drake filed a defamation lawsuit for lyrics that branded him a sexual predator, which he denies.Lamar leaned into the dilemma, teasing the song over and over during his set, before finally giving the audience what they wanted.When the song finally played, Kendrick self-censored the most contentious lyric, in which he calls Drake a "certified paedophile". But he looked directly into the camera with a mischievous grin as he called out Drake's name; and left intact the song's notorious double-entendre: "Tryin' to strike a chord and it's probably A minor."That lyric echoed around the Caesars Superdome in Louisiana, indicating that no amount of legal action could ever hope to diminish the song's popularity. In playing it, Lamar was expected to have reached more than 120 million TV viewers who had tuned in to see the game in which the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 40-22 to deny them an unprecedented third straight Super Bowl.The performance was further heightened by the surprise appearance of tennis star Serena Williams, who performed the Crip Walk - a notorious Los Angeles dance move - as Lamar prowled the stage.Drake's lawyers are suing Lamar's record label Universal Music Group over the track, accusing it of trying to "create a viral hit" out of a song that made "false factual allegations" about the star.Getty ImagesSerena Williams was the only unannounced guest star during the setSunday marked the first time that a solo rapper had headlined the Super Bowl, and Lamar brought an elaborate stage show, full of dancers, fireworks and special guests.But the rapper's lyrics have always explored the contradictions between ego and self-doubt, and his Super Bowl set put that conflict in the spotlight. He performed on a giant noughts and crosses board, flipping between introspective deep cuts (typically staged inside the Xs) and crowd-pleasing chart hits (which took place in the Os).Actor Samuel L Jackson, dressed as Uncle Sam, acted as emcee - berating Lamar when he became too self-indulgent, and praising his duets with R&B singer SZA."That's what I'm talking about," Jackson said, after the duo performed All The Stars, a ballad from the soundtrack to Marvel's Black Panther movie. "That's what America wants, nice and calm."It was a caricature, critiquing the expectation that Lamar would tone down his act for the TV audience. “Too loud, too reckless, too ghetto,” scolded Jackson at one point - but Lamar wasn’t prepared to compromise.  “The revolution about to be televised,” he intoned at the top of his set. “The picked the right time but the wrong guy.”Getty ImagesKendrick arrived on stage atop a black Buick GNX car - the same model his father drove home from hospital after he was born in 1987And whatever Lamar performed, the energy was electrifying. Early highlights included Humble and DNA, both taken from the rapper's Pulitzer Prize-winning album DAMN, and whose tectonic beats rattled around the stadium.The set, which is available to watch on YouTube, also included Squabble Up, Man At The Garden and another Drake diss track, Euphoria.Unlike most Super Bowl performers, Lamar isn't much of a mover, but he had a charismatic swagger as he walked in step with his dancers; and clever staging gave the show momentum - especially on nervy, angular tracks like Peekaboo.SZA also gave the set a lift, with supple vocals and improbably flexible choreography that helped soften Lamar's edgier instincts.Getty ImagesSZA and Lamar have been frequent collaborators, appearing on each other's albums since 2017ReutersSamuel L Jackson was the ringleader of Lamar's elaborate Super Bowl setNot Like Us was the undoubted climax, but Lamar took a victory lap on the bouncy West Coast anthem TV Off, where he boasted, "yeah, somebody gotta do it". He was joined on stage by the song's producer, Mustard, who clutched a football while sporting the world's baggiest jeans - before Lamar pointed an imaginary remote control at the camera and intoned, "Game Over".For fans, it was a powerful performance, full of Easter eggs - including a snippet of the unreleased song Bodies. Casual viewers might have agreed more with Samuel L Jackson's plea for Lamar to keep it light; especially as some of his more densely-written lyrics were rendered unintelligible by the stadium's cavernous echo.And it was noticeable that Lamar omitted to play his civil rights anthem Alright, in a year where the NFL chose to remove the phrase "end racism" from the end zone of the football field.The phrase had been present at the Super Bowl since 2020, amid the Black Lives Matter protests - for which Alright had become the unofficial soundtrack.Many had expected Lamar to make a bigger statement, especially with President Donald Trump in attendance, but the star's performance remained resolutely uncontroversial - unless, of course, your name is Drake. On-stage protestGetty ImagesA protester unveiled a flag during Not Like UsNonetheless, Lamar's show was sleek and streamlined - as many fans had expected, after audio of the backing track leaked on Thursday.The only interruption came at the climax of the 13-minute set, when a protester climbed on top of Lamar's black Buick GNX car and unfurled a combined Palestinian and Sudanese flag, before being tackled by security officers.The NFL later said in a statement that the protester was part of the 400-member cast who took part in the show.Kendrick Lamar and Drake beef: What's the latest?Taylor Swift, Lionel Messi, Jay-Z and Trump among big names at Super BowlEagles dominate Chiefs to deny them Super Bowl three-peatKendrick Lamar performs Drake diss track five times BBC 1 Xtra salutes Kendrick LamarWhich songs did Kendrick Lamar play?Getty ImagesThe career-spanning set crammed 11 songs into 13 minutes.

"But the resilience of New Orleans is matched by the resolve of our country."Getty ImagesJon Batiste became the first musician to perform the US National Anthem at the Super Bowl in front of a sitting president Musical performances before the game also included R&B artist Ledisi, who performed Lift Every Voice and Sing, often referred to as the Black National anthem, joined by 125 youth choir members.Musician Troy Andrews, popularly known as Trombone Shorty, and Christian singer-songwriter Lauren Daigle played America the Beautiful - giving the track a feel-good New Orleans vibe.And just before the game began, New Orleans native Jon Batiste sang the American National Anthem, adding a few jazz flourishes from his multi-coloured grand piano.Taylor SwiftKendrick LamarSuper BowlLady GagaMusicRelatedTaylor Swift set to provide Record Store Day boost12 Apr 2025NorthamptonshireThe country singer inspired by Taylor Swift and Glasgow15 Mar 2025Glasgow & West ScotlandClassics teacher is Taylor Swift 'Mastermind'20 Feb 2025NorfolkMore6 hrs agoRadiohead reimagined with classical twist in home cityLondon Concertante's Radiohead Reimagined plays Christ Church Cathedral in Oxford.6 hrs agoOxfordshire10 hrs agoRock & Roll Hall of Fame picks Outkast but not OasisVoters pick Outkast and Cyndi Lauper for induction, but overlook Oasis, Mariah Carey and New Order.10 hrs agoCulture13 hrs agoKneecap 'kill MP' footage being assessed by policeVideo has emerged of a gig in 2023 appearing to show one band member saying: "The only good Tory is a dead Tory."13 hrs agoNorthern Ireland18 hrs agoGlow Up is back, and Thunderbolts* hits cinemas: What's coming up this weekAnother Simple Favour is also coming out, while Samantha Crain drops her new album.18 hrs agoCulture21 hrs agoThe Lightning Seeds to headline Sussex NHS gig  Ian Broudie and his band are raising money for seven hospitals across Sussex. 21 hrs agoSussexBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.
