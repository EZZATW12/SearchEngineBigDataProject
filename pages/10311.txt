Trailing by 26 points at half-time, the top-seeded Thunder completed the second biggest second-half comeback in NBA play-off history to put the Grizzlies on the brink of elimination. The Grizzlies were in full control of the match at the start of the third quarter, up 77-51 and on course to strike back in the series.But an injury to Grizzlies point guard Ja Morant late in the second quarter proved a turning point, with the 25-year-old falling hard on his hip while attempting a dunk.The Grizzlies took a 29-point lead on the next play but then collapsed without the influential American, who is now a doubt for game four on Saturday (20:30 BST). "He's going through further evaluations tomorrow, then we'll know more," said Grizzlies interim coach Tuomas Iisalo.Shai Gilgeous-Alexander top-scored for the Thunder with 31 points, while Jalen Williams added 26 of his own. The Grizzlies must win in game four to keep their play-off hopes alive. Knicks squeeze past Pistons After losing game two, the New York Knicks established a 2-1 play-off series lead with a 118-116 win against the Detroit Pistons.Karl-Anthony Towns, Jalen Brunson, OG Anunoby and Mikal Bridges all scored more than 20 points, while Josh Hart excelled in defence with 11 rebounds and nine assists.The Pistons will rue a poor second quarter, in which they allowed a 23-6 run in the Knicks' favour to fall 13 points behind at half-time.Tim Hardaway Jr and Cade Cunningham led a spirited response, finishing with 24 points each.But it was not enough, with game four of the series in Detroit on Sunday (18:00 BST).
