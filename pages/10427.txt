In her BBC Sport column, American Mayer talks about the events leading up to victory in last September's first fight in New York when Ryan was hit by a can of red paint before leaving for the venue.On Friday, Ryan will address the controversy and rivalry between the pair.I was in my room and we were starting to walk to the elevator, waiting for the go-ahead from the team to say we could go down because we were at the same hotel as Sandy Ryan. Sandy was out there first waiting for her car so we stood by the elevator and my nutritionist said to wait because she hasn't got in the car yet.My nutritionist was looking at her phone and was like, 'oh my god, someone just threw paint on Sandy'. We were all taken aback but I didn't understand that I was apparently the culprit.I got in the car but didn't really understand the extent of it until I got to the arena and online there was a photo of Sandy, who was stripped down with red paint on her. ESPN came in to see me and apparently I'm being blamed for the attack.Everyone who knows me, knows that would be out of character for me - it's not my style. I expected her to try to blame me. I was her rival all week but there were also other things going on. Sandy has already said flyers attacking her were put up around the hotel and city.You can't just point a finger when there is no evidence leading back to me. I was upstairs waiting to walk down for the fight of my life. I didn't know what time she was going to be down there or that she was going first. The only people who knew were her team - maybe she should look inside her own circle.'I hope it doesn't happen going into this fight'The incident took me by surprise but I was in fight mode and it didn't happen to me, so I wasn't flustered.If someone had thrown paint on me I would have slapped paint on the ass of my fight shorts and got on with it.I was concerned that she was going to pull out - her team were really getting her going about it.There was a clip of her coach Kay Koroma in the locker room screaming at her to pull out of the fight which I thought was super suspicious. That was weird to me and out of character for him. I really don't think it was the paint that threw her off her game but her team, who made it a bigger deal than it had to be.Obviously I don't want that to happen and I hope it doesn't happen going into this fight. It could have been called off and, after two years of busting my butt to get back in that position, that was the last thing I wanted.As for 'paint-gate' being used to promote the rematch, I was surprised the Top Rank team used the paint on the promotion posters - but this is entertainment. I didn't have any say in it. If I had done anything like that, my manager would have had my neck as he tries to keep me professional.I didn't know about it until the poster came out and I said, 'do they have red paint on Sandy?'I was just as taken aback as anyone else, but it's kind of funny.'It felt like a movie' - Ryan relives paint attackPublished28 March'I have truth on my side'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Mayer (right) beat Ryan (left) by majority decision with one judge scoring it a drawIt's important for women's boxing to have these rivalries and this is definitely up there as one of the top ones.I never counted out the rematch and just wanted to see what my other options were. Once I saw the views and how much the fans wanted it - and the excuses - I thought let's do it again and I'll do it even better.I didn't get my rematch with Alycia Baumgardner so I understand Sandy might have been frustrated, but I didn't have to give her this rematch. I could have just sat it out, waited for Lauren Price to unify and fought for undisputed or faced someone else. That's not the fighter I am though.I pride myself on the fact a lot of the fights I have been in are competitive and people aren't sure who will win. My feud with Alycia will stay number one for a lifetime, but Sandy can come second because of the coaching team situation and the paint situation.Sandy and her team have tried to gaslight me in a sense where I'm supposed to be making all of this up or I'm being dramatic, but it happened.You're going to see coach Koroma, my coach of eight or nine years since the Olympics, in her corner so they really can't say anything about it. They did what they did and they have to stand by that. I'm just protecting myself and I'm the one who had to go out and find a whole new team at this stage of my career which is not easy. I have truth on my side.Mikaela Mayer was speaking to BBC Sport's Bobbie Jackson.What information do we collect from this quiz?Related topicsBoxingBoxing schedule and results 2025Published1 day agoWatch every Born to Brawl episodePublished28 April 2024More boxing from the BBCNotifications, social media and more with BBC SportPublished31 JanuaryTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8908 viewing8.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
