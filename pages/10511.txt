I'm just a little inconsistent," he said. "If I keep pushing forward, there's no reason why I can't win the Premier League this season."Littler was again seeking a record fifth nightly win of the season, but blew a 4-0 lead in a 6-5 loss to Van Gerwen in the quarter-finals.Manchester United fan Littler came out to boos from the Liverpool crowd, though he appeared to have shrugged those off as he did last year when claiming victory here.The 18-year-old looked emotional as he left the stage after missing two darts for a 5-1 lead, and two match darts at 5-3.World and defending Premier League champion Littler still remains top of the eight-player table and on track to qualify for the end-of-season play-offs on 29 May.There was also an early exit in Liverpool for local hero Stephen Bunting on his homecoming, beaten 6-1 by Rob Cross in the last eight.Dutchman Van Gerwen could not maintain his momentum in the semi-finals, going down 6-4 to Humphries, while Price defeated Cross 6-2.It was a happier night for Price, a week after he said his darts were "blowing everywhere" in breezy conditions in Rotterdam."Sometimes I do throw my toys out of the pram when things don't go my way, but I had a reason last week," he added. "We don't deserve to play in those conditions."Relive Premier League Darts night 12 in LiverpoolPremier League Darts schedule, results, prize moneyPublished3 days agoVan Gerwen wins German Grand Prix after nine-darterPublished6 days agoLittler booed and surrenders 4-0 leadImage source, PA MediaImage caption, Luke Littler won the Premier League in his debut campaign in 2024Littler had posted on social media beforehand to say "bring on the boos Liverpool" because of his support for United - and he got the reception he expected. However, he brushed that off and raced into a 4-0 lead against seven-time Premier League winner Van Gerwen and averaged more than 20 points higher per visit than the Dutchman.The teenager missed a dart at bullseye for 5-0 and that allowed Van Gerwen to reduce the deficit to 4-3.Littler took out a stunning 160 to move a leg away and nodded to the crowd before gesturing to them to calm down.He missed match darts at tops and double 10 in leg nine and Van Gerwen was able to take that and the subsequent two legs to win 6-5. Humphries, who Littler beat in last year's grand final, saw off Nathan Aspinall 6-3 in the opening quarter-final in a stunning performance.He averaged 113.5, took out 66.7% of his checkouts and controlled Aspinall, who himself averaged 104.03 and was 75% on the double. It was another tricky night for bottom-of-the-table Bunting as he was brushed aside in a dominant win for 2018 world champion Cross.The fourth quarter-final saw Price beat last week's winner Chris Dobey 6-2 with an average of 106.74.

It means we will get fourth v fifth in Sheffield on the final league-stage night, with the play-off spots potentially on the line.Players earn two points per quarter-final win, an additional point if they win their semi-final and five for winning the night.The top four players after the group stage progress to the play-off night at London's O2 Arena on 23 May, with first facing fourth and second against third in a best-of-19-leg match. The final, which is the best of 21 legs, follows.If players are level on points after the 16 weeks then places are decided by nights won and then matches won.Premier League Darts night 13 order of playThursday, 1 May - BirminghamLuke Littler v Stephen BuntingNathan Aspinall v Chris DobeyLuke Humphries v Gerwyn PriceRob Cross v Michael van GerwenRelated topicsDartsComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 521Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions7989 viewing8k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
