It has made me a better player and I've proved that in the past three weeks. In my opinion I've been one of the best players in the world in the past three or four weeks and I am confident. The thing with me is when I'm confident and I'm scoring well there isn't many people in darts that can beat me. This a big win for me tonight in my hometown. I'm going to get so much confidence from this."On injuries and dartitis: "I've come out and admitted that I've got a few issues and sometimes on TV it doesn't look the prettiest but I've found a way to get through it. I found a way to cope with it. It does affect me, but I am winning and I am winning tournaments. It is one of those where you either quit and go home or own it and make it part of your game and that is what I decided to do. I am so happy, I am in a good place and I am winning. "Five weeks ago I said 'I can't be doing this anymore' and then the past few weeks has proved why I'm still playing darts because I am one of the best players in the world."On his fighting spirit: "I've been through an horrendous two years but I am a fighter, I am a warrior and people like Michael van Gerwen call me a Jack Russell. I don't know when I'm beaten and at the end of the day I am in a privileged position and I respect that. I'll keep fighting till the end I will never ever give up. The Premier League brings the best out of me. I am so happy, I've been through a lot of rubbish."504Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingPostpublished at 23:01 British Summer Time 10 April23:01 BST 10 AprilResult: Aspinall 6-4 HumphriesWayne MardleFormer World Championship semi-finalist on Sky SportsNathan was 3-0 down and it was looking like an impossible task.

It wasn't a pretty game in the final but I have never, ever, ever, been so nervous as on those last darts."I am in Manchester. What support I've had tonight. They were absolutely unreal. I wanted to win so much for the crowd. Three years ago on my Premier League I couldn't handle the nerves and last year I got beat in the semi-finals by Luke Littler, I wanted to win it so much. All my family and friends are here, so many people are here supporting me, and I'm so glad I won for them."532Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingPostpublished at 22:52 British Summer Time 10 April22:52 BST 10 AprilResult: Aspinall 6-4 HumphriesDan DawsonCommentator on Sky SportsThe lad from Stockport has won it.
