What support I've had tonight. They were absolutely unreal. I wanted to win so much for the crowd."I've been through an horrendous two years but I am a fighter, I am a warrior and people like Michael van Gerwen call me a Jack Russell."I don't know when I'm beaten and at the end of the day I am in a privileged position and I respect that. I'll keep fighting till the end I will never ever give up."Aspinall has struggled with dartitis and injury in recent years but is now up to fourth in the standings, level on points with Price in third and Van Gerwen in fifth.Littler, who has been seeking a record fifth nightly win of the season, remains top but his lead has been trimmed to five points by Humphries.Premier League Darts schedule, results, prize moneyPublished3 days agoRecap: All the darting drama as it happened in ManchesterBunting's Berlin win ends Premier League droughtPublished3 AprilPrice nine-darter and Humphries hits 118 averageImage source, PAImage caption, Gerwyn Price's nine-darter was his fourth in the Premier LeagueSparks flew in the quarter-finals.Price was trailing Littler 5-1 in the quarter-finals when he recorded his first nine-darter, and the fourth overall, of this year's competition.The Welshman followed Humphries, Rob Cross and Littler in achieving the perfect leg.Price hit five 180s to one for his opponent and was only just behind the teenager's average of 103.93, but Littler ended a six-game losing streak to the 2021 world champion and tapped his watch at the end as if to say 'about time'.Humphries had said this week that he will keep quiet in the future after facing a backlash regarding his comments about struggling with the current darts schedule.He faced Stephen Bunting on the back of his opponent winning his first points of the campaign following a night victory a week ago, and lifting the International Open title on Sunday.But 2024 world champion Humphries produced a special display, with his 118.43 average the third highest in a Premier League match.Van Gerwen shrugged off injury concerns with an impressive 6-4 defeat of Chris Dobey.Cross was two away from his own nine-darter in the second leg of his tie against Aspinall, who reeled off four in succession to triumph 6-2 for an eighth successive win over his fellow Englishman.Premier League Darts night 10 resultsFinalNathan Aspinall 6-4 Luke HumphriesSemi-finalsMichael van Gerwen 2-6 Nathan AspinallLuke Littler 4-6 Luke HumphriesQuarter-finalsChris Dobey 4-6 Michael van GerwenNathan Aspinall 6-2 Rob CrossLuke Littler 6-3 Gerwyn PriceStephen Bunting 1-6 Luke HumphriesPremier League Darts tablePremier League Darts format and points systemPremier League Darts is played across 16 initial weeks in the league stage with quarter-finals, semi-finals and a final each night.Each of the eight players is guaranteed to face the other seven in the quarter-finals in weeks one to seven and 9-15, with week eight and week 16 fixtures done off the table. It means we will get fourth v fifth in Sheffield on the final league-stage night, with the play-off spots potentially on the line.Players earn two points per quarter-final win, an additional point if they win their semi-final and five for winning the night.The top four players after the group stage progress to the play-off night at London's O2 Arena on 23 May, with first facing fourth and second against third in a best-of-19-leg match. The final, which is the best of 21 legs, follows.If players are level on points after the 16 weeks then places are decided by nights won and then matches won.Premier League Darts night 11 order of playThursday, 17 April - RotterdamChris Dobey v Luke HumphriesGerwyn Price v Nathan AspinallStephen Bunting v Michael van GerwenLuke Littler v Rob CrossRelated topicsDartsComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 67Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8000 viewing8k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
