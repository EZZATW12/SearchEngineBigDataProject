After a 6-1 win over Dirk van Duijvenbode in the second round of the International Darts Open on Saturday, an emotional Humphries told Sky Sports that playing felt like a "chore" and he needed a break for his mental wellbeing. The 2024 world champion also said that he felt "emotionless" as a result of playing too much.On Sunday, Humphries then said he had been misunderstood after he received some criticism on social media, mostly regarding how much he is paid."Considering the comments and people not understanding what I meant, it will be the last time I ever confess my real feelings to the public," Humphries responded on X."Everything I say or ever do just never seems to be good enough for anybody."As long as no one complains when we all give the same answers in interviews like robots and not our true feelings, then everyone I guess will be happy, or usually will still find a way to moan at us." Humphries, who lost to eventual champion Stephen Bunting in the semi-finals, is also currently competing in the Premier League, where he is second in the table behind world champion Luke Littler. After winning last year's World Championship, Humphries reflected on his rise to the top of the sport having had mental health challenges and suffered from anxiety at times in his career. He has admitted that after one anxiety attack on stage in 2018 he contemplated quitting the sport.The 30-year-old's defence of the world championship ended at the last 16 stage this year, losing to former champion Peter Wright.If you have been affected by the issues raised, there is help available via the BBC Action Line.Related topicsDartsTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8814 viewing8.8k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
