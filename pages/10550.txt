He's been saying all the right things but he will have been doubting himself. He must be feeling a million dollars, I'm delighted for him.To get over the line, the relief as well. It will be a tough slog to get to the play-offs, but there is a lot of Premier League darts yet to play. He's played well tonight has Stephen Bunting, and he will feel a lot more relaxed next week in Manchester.807Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharing'To win a night is such a special feeling'published at 21:39 British Summer Time 3 April21:39 BST 3 AprilMore from Stephen Bunting, speaking to Sky Sports after his victory in Berlin:"Don't get me wrong, there have been times through the Premier League where I've thought: 'Could I finish on zero points?'"But to get off the mark tonight and to win a night is such a special feeling."I felt so good in the practice room, I hit a nine-darter early on. I had a good run in Leicester the other day [in the Players Championship] which gave me a lot of confidence. I know I've been playing well and just not got the results."This is going to give me huge confidence and I can't wait to finish the campaign. I've really enjoyed it, even though I've not won a game until tonight. We all want to be in the Premier League, it's the place to be and I want to be in it for many years to come."855Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingPostpublished at 21:36 British Summer Time 3 April21:36 BST 3 AprilResult: Bunting 6-5 PriceIt was not a classic final - 93.73 v 93.12 in the averages.Gerwyn Price had more than his fair share of chances, but could only convert five of 22 checkout opportunities.457Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharing'I was so relieved to get off zero points'published at 21:34 British Summer Time 3 April21:34 BST 3 AprilNight nine winner Stephen Bunting, speaking to Sky Sports:"After the first win, I was so relieved to get off zero points. I've put a lot of work in behind the scenes, I've tried 110% every single week without fail. I tried to give these fans everything I could, I've won an event and I'm so happy."For the past few years, I've felt I've been a far better player than I was when I won the Lakeside World Championship [in 2014]. There's a lot of hard work gone in behind the scenes, I've got a great management team and a lovely family behind me, and the fan base is unbelievable. Without these fans, I can't win games like these."1253Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingUpdated Premier League tablepublished at 21:31 British Summer Time 3 April21:31 BST 3 AprilThe Premier League table has a rather odd look now - top and bottom heavy when it comes to night wins.Stephen Bunting has a lot of work on to make the play-offs, but he's taken that first step.8913Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingPostpublished at 21:29 British Summer Time 3 April21:29 BST 3 AprilResult: Bunting 6-5 PriceTonight marked the start of the second half of the Premier League season.

The man who had not won a single match in the 2025 Premier League so far has won three in Berlin and takes the crown.He looks thrilled, and gets a hug from Gerwyn Price. Plenty of people will be delighted tonight for one of the nicest men in darts.88341Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingPostpublished at 21:25 British Summer Time 3 April21:25 BST 3 AprilBunting 5-5 PriceNo treble from Price, Bunting needs 107...11627Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingPostpublished at 21:25 British Summer Time 3 April21:25 BST 3 AprilBunting 5-5 PriceThis German crowd has not taken to Gerwyn Price - whistles and boos when he has a shot at victory, and angry thumbs up from Price when he misses.A 140 means Price could win - if he gets a 170 finish...3634Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingBunting breakspublished at 21:24 British Summer Time 3 April21:24 BST 3 AprilBunting 5-5 PriceYou could cut the tension with a knife. The boistrous crowd is quietened slightly.They are loud again though as Bunting finds 180, and when Price can't check out, Liverpool-born Bunting has a chance - but misses at bull!But amid whistles from the crowd, Price can't capitalise and Bunting holds it together. We go to a deciding leg!16924Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingPrice breakspublished at 21:21 British Summer Time 3 April21:21 BST 3 AprilBunting 4-5 PriceOnly five 180s so far in this final, three of them to Bunting. Both men are averaging well south of 95. One for the purists is the kindest way of describing it.But that's much better from Bunting, his fourth 180 of the match to set up a 45 checkout. Miss at D16... miss at D8!Price requires 71. Miss at D10... hit on D5!A massive roar from Price, who wins the night if he holds throw. Big if.5084Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingPrice holdspublished at 21:19 British Summer Time 3 April21:19 BST 3 AprilBunting 4-4 PriceGerwyn Price is trying to gee himself up with some big fist pumps and roars, he now needs to hold his own throw after Stephen Bunting finally did so at the seventh time of asking for both players.Price has three darts to find 76, and after an awkward second dart his third plunges into D8 to keep us all square.4160Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingBunting holdspublished at 21:17 British Summer Time 3 April21:17 BST 3 AprilBunting 4-3 PriceHas Stephen Bunting settled? He looks much more confident as he reaches a 96 finish on his own throw, and comfortably lands T20, D18.Much, MUCH more like it.12518Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingBunting breaks back yet againpublished at 21:15 British Summer Time 3 April21:15 BST 3 AprilBunting 3-3 PriceImage source, Getty ImagesIs it easier psychologically to throw against the darts? Both men have thrown poorly on their own legs so far. A very strange final, with neither man playing at their best.Stephen Bunting narrowly misses a 108 checkout for another break, however Gerwyn Price - looking very agitated - cannot make 117.Bunting then finishes off, and for the sixth successive leg it goes against the throw. Remarkable.7416Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingPostpublished at 21:14 British Summer Time 3 April21:14 BST 3 AprilBunting 2-3 PriceWayne MardleFormer World Championship semi-finalist on Sky SportsThat was the first time this evening that Stephen looked to have lost that little bit of composure - just that one dart. We'll see how that resonates, maybe it won't bother him.But that was so quick, you've got to give yourself time to raise the arm from down to up, otherwise you won't reach tops.129Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingPrice breaks yet againpublished at 21:12 British Summer Time 3 April21:12 BST 3 AprilBunting 2-3 PriceWell this final has lacked quality, but not intrigue. And drama now, as Price gets a bounce-out!He responds with 174 to set up a finish for a fifth straight break, needing the bull, but is well off target.Bunting however totally rushes his dart at D20, hitting single five. That allows Price in again - and for the FIFTH STRAIGHT LEG, it goes against the darts.2742Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingBunting breaks back againpublished at 21:10 British Summer Time 3 April21:10 BST 3 AprilBunting 2-2 PriceIt has been all or nothing with Gerwyn Price lately - in the last six Premier League nights he has won two, exited in the opening round in the other four.Here he is in another final, and after Bunting can't convert the big fish, Price aims for a 56 checkout - but this time misses twice at tops!Bunting cannot capitalise, so Price has another three darts to go 3-1 - but he can't manage it! And Price gives a sarcastic thumbs up to the crowd, not happy at all.Bunting sees it out - four legs, four breaks.5814Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingprevious pagePage 1 of 7123456…7next pageHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright © 2025 BBC.
