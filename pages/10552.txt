In the past I probably throw those games away. There were some ragged points but I'm glad to get a win."White, ranked 52nd in the PDC order of merit, had reached his first professional tour final in five years having knocked out world champion Littler in the last 32.The 54-year-old, nicknamed 'Diamond', had given Littler a scare in the fourth round of the World Championships earlier this year.Before that match White revealed he used to beat 18-year-old Littler's grandfather on the pub darts circuit in Runcorn in the 1990s.In his second meeting with the Warrington teenager, White triumphed 6-5 after a thrilling deciding leg.Littler failed to land a 102 checkout to give White a chance and he nailed 46, finishing with double top, to progress at the expense of his fellow Englishman.White went on to score wins over Josh Rock and Cameron Menzies in the quarters and semis before he came unstuck against Price.Gary Anderson, meanwhile, compiled a nine-dart finish in his first-round match against Krzysztof Ratajski, before he lost in the last 32.Rock wins Players Championship 10The second event of the Leicester double header saw Josh Rock beat Cameron Menzies to win the Players Championship 10 on Tuesday.The Northern Irishman won 8-4 to claim his first title of the year and fifth of his career.Rock beat Scott Williams 7-5 to reach the final, who had earlier defeated Luke Littler 6-4 in the quarter-finals. There are 34 Players Championship events across the year with the competition's finals held in Minehead from 21 to 23 November.Related topicsDartsMore on this storyWorld darts champion to receive £1m prize moneyPublished31 MarchPremier League Darts schedule, results, prize moneyPublished3 days agoDarts club members triple due to 'Littler effect'Published21 MarchTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8881 viewing8.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
