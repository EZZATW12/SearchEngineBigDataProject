The Court of Arbitration for Sport reduced the suspension to two years, meaning Russian athletes had to compete under a 'neutral' flag until 16 December 2022.Russia has been banned from competing at sporting events since the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Polukhin is one of two athletes found to have violated anti-doping rules at Sochi 2014. The other was Italian Para ice hockey player Igor Stella, whose case was announced during the Games.Polukhin's case will be passed to the International Ski and Snowboarding Federation and the International Biathlon Union to determine if any further action is required.Related topicsDisability SportTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9637 viewing9.6k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
