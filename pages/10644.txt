But that final mile, back to where I completed that first marathon as someone who never thought they would be able to run, will be incredible."Running has been life changing for me and my family."World record hope for paralympian after city runPublished4 July 2024NHS prosthetics hold athletes back - ParalympianPublished23 August 2024Paralympian launches inclusive charity fun runPublished8 June 2022Whitehead, who has two prosthetics after being born without the lower part of his legs, established himself as a sporting icon for all that he achieved as an athlete dubbed 'Britain's bladerunner'.He is the marathon man who turned into a sprint star after he was told his classification would not feature in the long distance events at his home Paralympics in 2012.He spent the best part of the decade after that challenging for, and often winning, the biggest prizes on offer over 100m and 200m.But it is over 26.2 miles that Whitehead continues to go strong at the age of 48.He has completed three marathons in 2025 already, taking his overall tally to 83, and has a packed schedule of races ahead of him to get to the milestone century later this year."I'll be travelling all over the world to significant places that have supported me or I've competed at in the past," Whitehead said."And then delivering by not just running 26 miles, but also delivering a performance that I'm proud of but also, hopefully, showcases who I am as a person from Nottingham, East Midlands and Great Britain."But also highlights disability to people that may have never seen it before."Hopefully it challenges that anything is possible in life. If you believe you can achieve massive things."Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Richard Whitehead won gold in the men's T42 200m at the London 2012 ParalympicsPreparations for the arduous months ahead has had Whitehead in the sports science labs at Loughborough University's Peter Harrison Centre, which specialises in disability sport research. Every facet of what he puts into his training has been logged, monitored and studied."I'm 48-years-old now and I feel like I have used my age as knowledge and experience, but I still feel there are lots of areas that I can improve," Whitehead said."People bang on about retirement and say 'at your age you should be doing something else', but I think its about changing that status quo and changing the dial around what is possible."Related topicsDisability SportTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8399 viewing8.4k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
