After a double win at the Para Swimming European Championships in Madeira, Portugal, where she triumphed with a European and British record, Iona is predicted to continue her rapid progress at the Games, at just 13-years-old.Image caption, Iona competes in the S7 classification in Para sport championshipsIona's passion for swimming was nurtured from a young age, with her mother Gillian taking her to 'Mother and Baby' swimming groups from just six months old. Her love for the sport really took hold when she joined her older brothers’ swimming club, after watching them compete from the sidelines. Iona became the youngest member of the ‘Learn to Swim’ team at five, before quickly moving up the ranks, and has been training at Tonbridge Swimming Club in Kent, for the last five years.In 2024 alone, Iona has achieved an impressive amount, competing at the Para Swimming European Championships, British Summer Championships, the Paralympic trials, and the Para Swimming World Series in Italy. “It's been a whirlwind!” Iona's mother, Gillian exclaimed: “In six months, going from national level, to international level - she’s making her dream.”After winning the SM7 200m Individual Medley at the European Championships, Iona was determined to double her win with a second gold medal in the SB7 100m Breaststroke. “It was quite good because when I got into the second race, I was going in as the fastest qualifier, so I knew I had a really good chance of winning," Iona said, "So when I did start swimming, I did it like I planned to do it.” Iona secured the top spot with a breathtaking time of one minute, 29.91 seconds, and now, she’s about to face her biggest challenge yet: making her Paralympic debut.But Iona is not the first British 13-year-old to make waves in the swimming pool; one of Iona's heroes, Ellie Simmonds OBE, did just that in 2008, before Iona was even born - a fact that gives Iona confidence going into the Games.“I look up to Ellie Simmonds a lot.” Iona said, having met the ParalympicGB legend multiple times with Ellie often commentating at Para swimming competitions. “She's watched my races few times… so I know her quite well." A fellow Paralympic swimmer, Ellie has won the coveted Paralympics gold medal five times in the S6 classification, winning her first at the 2008 Beijing Paralympics at age 13, just as Iona hopes to do. “Ellie has a similar disability to me. She's been a really big inspiration for a lot of people, with short stature and dwarfism. In 2008, that's when the Paralympics first started looking at her, and now it feels like we're seeing a lot more come through which is nice."Image caption, Iona is the youngest ParalympicsGB athleteRanked first in her category, winning a gold medal could be on the cards for Iona too, and while some might find this kind of sporting pressure difficult to manage, Iona sees things differently - she believes she performs at her best when she is under pressure: “I really am quite the person who likes pressure.” She explains, “Getting my nerves together can work quite well, it makes me perform better at the big events. I know I can perform at a high level, so it's nice when I'm able to do that."Well managed pressure and intensity drives Iona to push herself further; she attests to the power of setting yourself challenges to improve over time and achieve your goals, whether that’s getting to the final, bagging a medal, or setting a new personal best; "Some children find that being in an environment that's too high pressure can get to them, and some children like to be in high pressure environments and can perform greatly." The proof is in the pudding too – during her Paralympics training, Iona has been beating her personal records again and again in her pursuit of her gold medal.And the pressure doesn’t end there either, schoolwork can be difficult to manage alongside extra-curricular activities for any child. When asked how she balances training and international competitions with schoolwork, Iona said she usually trains after school, “It’s just getting a balance, right… generally I just try and do what I can, when I can. Sometimes I'm so tired, they make me rest, like, 'You need a nap!'”When it comes to getting fellow disabled people interested and actively participating in sport, Iona’s advice takes a grassroots approach to making that first step: “If you have a disability, just drop by and see what your local club offers. If you want to do it, join it, and then you can go from there.” Iona believes swimming can help young disabled people with their physical strength and found training really beneficial to her mental health following the Covid-19 pandemic. "I was on quite a high before Covid, and when Covid hit me, it got me quite down, and it was hard to get back up… now I'm on my way to Paris!"Asked about the life skills that inclusive sports can offer, Iona said, "Teamwork, and just being around other people with disabilities". This is a benefit Iona has appreciated on her inclusive sports journey - getting to meet other disabled people, and make new friends. At the Para Swimming European Championships in Madeira, Iona enjoyed forming bonds with her teammates: “There was another girl who I shared a room with, it was her first international [competition] too, so it was quite good having someone else. It was quite a small team going to that, so it was a nice atmosphere to be in.”Image caption, Iona is making her Paralympic debut in Paris 2024How is Iona feeling ahead of Paris?“Excited! I'm just, like, ready to go.” She tells us. “All the teachers at my school were like, ‘She's going to Paris, so we need to watch her!’"And what’s that like?“Pretty cool.”Want to try inclusive Paralympic sport activities yourself?
