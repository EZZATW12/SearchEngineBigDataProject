You just can't get away with dropping that many chances against top nations," said the Irish captain."We bowled really well. [It was] Just those chances."Ireland beaten by Pakistan in opening qualifierpublished at 13:10 9 April13:10 9 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Ireland looked in a good position during the partnership between Amy Hunter (left) and Gaby Lewis (right) but their departures helped the hosts take controlICC Women's World Cup qualifier, LahorePakistan 217 (49 overs): Riaz 52, Ameen 51; J Maguire 3-33, Kelly 2-34, Murray 2-49Ireland 179 (44 overs): Lewis 44, Hunter 44; Baig 4-35, Sandhu 3-41, Iqbal 2-37Pakistan won by 38 runsScorecardIreland lost nine wickets for only 83 runs as they collapsed from a strong position to suffer a 38-run defeat against hosts Pakistan in their opening Women's World Cup qualifier in Lahore.The Irish restricted Pakistan to only 217 from 49 overs in Lahore with Jane Maguire taking three wickets as Aliya Riaz and Sidra Ameen hit 52 and 51 for the hosts.In their reply, Ireland reached 96-1 as captain Gaby Lewis (44) and Amy Hunter (44) produced a 69-run partnership but their departures within four overs turned the match in Pakistan's favour.Orla Prendergast batted for nearly 17 overs as she hit 37 but wickets fell regularly at the other end as home bowlers Diana Baig and Nashra Sandhu did most of the damage.Baig produced bowling figures of 4-35 with Sandhu's three wickets including the vital dismissals of Lewis, Hunter and Laura Delany for a duck as Ireland slipped from 96-1 to 119-4 in 6.2 overs.Ireland briefly rallied as Prendergast and Leah Paul put on 34 for the fifth wicket but Paul's departure after being trapped lbw by Sadia Iqbal effectively ended Irish resistance they were only able to add a further 24 runs.In the Pakistan innings, Maguire removed Gull Feroza for four in the second over, before Muneeba Ali and Sidra put on 77 for the second wicket.However, Cara Murray trapped Sidra and then had Riaz caught by Louise Little to leave the hosts on 175-4 before they lost their last six wickets for only 42 runs with Arlene Kelly taking two dismissals late in the innings.The Irish will be back in action on Friday against West Indies at the same Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore before further contests against Bangladesh, Thailand and Scotland.Only the two top teams in the round-robin qualifier will secure places at the World Cup in India in September.Ireland 'confident' before World Cup qualifier - Lewispublished at 16:34 8 April16:34 8 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Gaby Lewis will captain Ireland for the qualifying tournament in PakistanIreland captain Gaby Lewis says her side are feeling "very confident" before their forthcoming ODI World Cup qualifier event in Pakistan.Ireland will take part in the six-team qualifier tournament, which runs from Wednesday, 9 April until Friday, 18 April.They will face Pakistan, West Indies, Bangladesh, Thailand and Scotland in a round-robin format.The top two teams will qualify for September's eight-team World Cup, and Lewis believes Ireland are in a good place for their first game against Pakistan on Wednesday."We're feeling very confident going into this qualifier. We've had some great preparation leading up to it with a good training camp in Dubai, and we've been working really hard to acclimatise to the heat," she said. "We're trying not to put too much pressure on ourselves. It's mostly about going out, enjoying ourselves and playing with our own aggressive nature - then hopefully the results will look after themselves."Ireland have not qualified for an ODI World Cup since 2005, and they came second in last year's T20 World Cup qualifier after losing against Scotland in the final.Amy Hunter and Jane Maguire have returned to the squad following injuries, while Kia McCartney has received her first call-up.Before their opener against Pakistan, Ed Joyce's side played two warm-up games, against West Indies and Thailand, with all-rounder Laura Delany scoring back-to-back half-centuries.Lewis believes Delany will be key to Ireland's hopes of finishing in the top two and qualifying for the tournament in India."She has done brilliantly in the first two warm-up games. She's also been great for us over the last 12 months - so looking forward to seeing her with bat and ball in this qualifier tournament."20:37 11 MarchIreland call off Afghanistan series 'for financial reasons', published at 20:37 11 MarchIreland call off Afghanistan series 'for financial reasons'AttributionCricketZimbabwe win series against Irish after game abandoned published at 21:53 25 February21:53 25 FebruaryImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Sikandar Raza made 34 from 27 balls at Harare Sports Club on TuesdayThird Twenty20 international, HarareZimbabwe 142-6 (18 overs): Raza 34; Delany 2-5, Young 2-38Ireland did not bat:Match abandonedScorecard Zimbabwe secured a 1-0 series victory over Ireland after the third and final T20 in Harare was abandoned because of rain.

That's what we did from game one to game two. We scored more runs in this game and hopefully we can do in the final match and sneak a win."The sides will meet at the Niranjan Shah Stadium again on Wednesday for the third and final ODI.19:18 11 JanuaryIreland's Maguire reported for suspect bowling action, published at 19:18 11 JanuaryIreland's Maguire reported for suspect bowling actionAttributionWomen's Cricketprevious pagePage 1 of 36123456…36next pageHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright © 2025 BBC.
