"You're talking about the same competition and teams playing to different rules."We're in the Championship, we should be playing the same rules. "We're talking about it for the club game, but if we can't get it right at the very top, it's very, very difficult."The rule was in use during Monaghan's Ulster SFC quarter-final defeat by Donegal on Sunday but that game ended in controversial circumstances.The Farney County had a sideline ball as the hooter sounded and believed they would be permitted a final play when behind 0-23 to 0-21. Instead, referee David Coldrick correctly blew the final whistle. While both Donegal and Monaghan had played under the hooter in the Allianz League, where it was only in use in the top two divisions, McConville believes its partial implementation contributed to the confusion."The biggest problem with the hooter is for a lot of teams, it's very new, the teams down in the lower divisions," added the Wicklow manager."The other problem is how visible the clocks are in the stadiums, which is an essential part of using the hooter. I think we haven't nailed that."We've gone with a system and a rule change that we're not ready for."While believing that the hooter is "a brilliant idea" for the future, McConville feels discussions are needed over whether it remains in use this season."We're not ready for it. It might be time to sideline it. "Over the next couple of days they really need to have a strong look at that."Related topicsGaelic GamesNorthern Ireland SportTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9052 viewing9.1k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Northern Ireland sportThe 'rugby student' stepping up to lead IrelandPre-contract agreements - why are they different in NI?Record-breaker Dunlop 'breaks mould' of modern sporting heroesMeet Jude McAtamney - the New York Giants kicker from Derry Elsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
