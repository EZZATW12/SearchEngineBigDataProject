I am giving her the opportunity to see that you can come back from any injury, no matter how long the process is."European all-around champion Jessica, who suffered her ACL injury in "a freak accident" at the 2023 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships, has endured "a very long process" to re-build her strength and fitness over time as "there is no quick fix"."I am a little bit nervous to compete because it has been a little while since I've been in an arena, but competing is what I love to do so it gives me excitement at the same time."We took it nice and slow to make sure it was done right. It was difficult in the moments when something that used to be so easy was becoming really hard. For example, just lifting my heel off the floor."That was such a great challenge. But as time went on, I fought through that feeling of giving up or not doing the small details in the rehab, and it got easier."Jessica will however only be competing on bars and beam with basic dismounts as she works towards returning to all four apparatus by the end of the year.She now hopes to be able to repay her sister for the support and help she received when the roles are reversed following Jennifer's surgery."I think destiny was like 'no you are staying as twins no matter what'," Jessica joked about the mirroring of their injuries."I felt like I was going in to it a little bit blind and so did my team, but Jen totally knows what the journey looks like now and can see that you can come back and be stronger."Jennifer said: "Not many people can say they have had this injury, so it's a unique story that we have both done it. "We both want to be there in LA for the 2028 Olympics and be as fit and strong as we physically can be."We want to do as many competitions as we can in this cycle to build our skills and to get us back out there as twins on the big stage."Who else should I look out for?Jake Jarman, who won Olympic floor bronze at Paris 2024, took to the podium five times at last year's British Championships and will be hoping to repeat the same feat this time around.Fresh from his success at the Games, Harry Hepworth will bid to retain his British rings title and Courtney Tulloch will hope to continue his strong track record at this Championship in the all-around and apparatus finals.Related topicsGymnasticsTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8948 viewing8.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
