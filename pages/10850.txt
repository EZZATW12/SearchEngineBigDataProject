Her father and several relatives died in the Auschwitz death camp.A year after the Melbourne Games, Keleti settled in Israel, where she married and had two children while coaching gymnastics.Keleti died on Thursday at Budapest Military Hospital, where she was being treated for heart failure and breathing difficulties, says the HOC. She would have turned 104 on 9 January.Related topicsGymnasticsOlympic GamesTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8899 viewing8.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
