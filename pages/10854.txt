The East London Gymnastics Centre (ELCG), run by a charity, was told it had until the new year to leave its current venue because the freeholder had sold it to a developer.Newham mayor Rokhsana Fiaz said becoming a community asset would allow the charity to attempt to buy the building themselves - but the management said this remains unclear.A spokesperson for Linea Homes, which is the proposed developer, previously said that its intended new tenant would bring "significant" health and social benefits to the community.Facundo ArrizabalagaThe centre opened in 1997 with National Lottery Funding It is understood the developer had until 27 November to object or challenge the ACV decision, and Newham Council told the BBC it did not receive any such objections. With the help of National Lottery funding, the centre opened in 1997 and has supported the careers of several top Olympians and has trained Hollywood actor, Tom Holland in the past.The gymnastics club offers training at prices it says are "significantly less" than others in London.It continues to produce top-level gymnasts who are part of the GB national squad and the Polish squad. Organisers said athletes from as far as Australia and America use the space when they are in London.They said the centre sees around 2,500 people of all ages and abilities every week, taking part in sports including taekwondo, karate, pole fitness, dance and yoga as well as gymnastics.Getty ImagesCampaigners are hoping to save the gym before it is due to close around ChristmasKirk Zammit, who runs charity the East London School of Gymnastics, Movement and Dance, said it was great the ACV application had been approved, but the information they have is incomplete."We don't know if this ACV gives us a chance to bid, because the details are very grey," Mr Zammit told BBC London. He said information from the council has been unclear as to whether the ACV status  now allows them to halt the sale or if the process is too far along. He said the charity management would do "everything it could" to raise the funds if given the chance to bid.'Seeking support'The campaign to save the centre from closing has been supported by thousands of people through an online petition, as well as backing from the council, and Labour MP for West Ham and Beckton, James Asser, who said it would be a tragedy if the centre was to close.Marina Sanduleac, whose daughter trains four times a week as an elite gymnast, previously told the Local Democracy Reporting Service: “We need something in the borough for children because there’s nothing.“Everything is closing down. We’re really seeking support from anybody who can help us and can give us a hand to save it."What is an ACV?Buildings and land, whether public or private, can be designated as Assets of Community Value under the Localism Act 2011. This designation can protect spaces that enhance social well-being or interests, such as sporting, cultural, or recreational activities, from development or change of use. Communities can nominate assets to their local authority, and successful nominations are added to the council’s ACV register. If listed assets are to be sold, or leased for 25+ years, communities get six weeks to express interest and up to six months to prepare a bid. While owners aren’t obliged to sell to the community, the listing grants them the right to bid.Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.
