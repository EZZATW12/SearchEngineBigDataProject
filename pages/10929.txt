The Kniphand, trained by Nigel Twiston-Davies, was one of several fallers in the race, while Macdermott was pulled up.Captain Cody won with an ice-cool ride from British champion jockey Harry Cobden.Cobden, in only his second ride for Mullins, who saddled the first three at Aintree last week, exuded confidence on the winner."I gave Harry one instruction - I said this horse only wins for Jody Townend, Paul's sister, and when Paul gets on, it doesn't particularly work well, so I said to Harry to put on your best ladies' voice! He's Ms Harry Cobden now," said Mullins.Our Power was third ahead of Grozni, with Rock My Way in fifth place.Despite being odds-on favourite to win the trainers' title in a fortnight, Mullins is taking nothing for granted in his battle with Dan Skelton."Dan won't be standing still so he'll probably win it, and if he does he'll feel like he's won a proper title," Mullins said.Only eight of the 23 runners finished the Scottish National, and campaign group Animal Rising said the race was "nothing short of carnage".Activists had criticised the sport following the death of Celebre D'Allen after the Grand National at Aintree.Meanwhile on Saturday, jockey Harry Atkins was stood down for the day after falling on Snipe and being knocked unconscious.Related topicsHorse RacingMore on this storyLatest horse racing resultsTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9721 viewing9.7k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
