I'm obsessed with horses; I love them and I care deeply. I was absolutely heartbroken when the horse died, more than anyone can imagine."The only thing I want people to know is that I'm more upset than anybody that something has happened and that if I'd thought for a moment that I might cost him his life or cause him a bad injury, then I would never have jumped the last."Celebre D'Allen's death prompted criticism from animal rights groups, with Animal Rising saying the sport of horse racing was to blame for the horse's death.Related topicsHorse RacingMore on this storyLatest horse racing resultsTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9721 viewing9.7k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
