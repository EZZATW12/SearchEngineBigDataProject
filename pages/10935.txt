However, tests found the horse's immune system was "severely compromised" after the "exercise-associated episode" during Saturday's race.The 13-year-old did not finish at Aintree, having been pulled up after the final fence before collapsing on the track.After initially showing signs of recovery, Celebre D'Allen's condition "deteriorated significantly" and he died on Tuesday.Jockey Micheal Nolan, Celebre D'Allen's rider, was handed a 10-day suspension after Aintree stewards ruled he had "continued in the race when the horse appeared to have no more to give and was clearly losing ground after the second-last fence".But the post-mortem examination found that the effects of the incident had "concluded by the time of death".Grand National horse that collapsed after final fence diesPublished8 AprilNick Rockett wins Grand National for Mullins duoPublished5 AprilThe horse developed pleuropneumonia - a bacterial respiratory infection - after the race.The infection resulted in the onset of sepsis, which is "likely to have been a key factor" in the cause of death.Blood tests taken on the day of the race indicated that the infection had not been present in the horse on raceday.The British Horseracing Authority (BHA) said the post-mortem examination was just "one part" of their reviewing process of any fatality and that Celebre D'Allen's death would be analysed in detail. Celebre D'Allen was a 125-1 shot at the National, which was won by jockey Patrick Mullins on Nick Rockett.On Tuesday, it was also announced that Mullins has been given an eight-day ban after his ride was referred to the Whip Review Committee.The amateur jockey, 35, breached the whip rules during the race, using his whip eight times after the final fence when the limit in jump racing is seven.He will be suspended for eight separate days including 23 and 25 April.Celebre D'Allen's death prompted criticism from animal rights groups, with Animal Rising saying the sport of horse racing was to blame for the horse's death. Animal Aid said it was "disgraceful" to allow a horse of Celebre D'Allen's age to be ridden in the "most gruelling race in the country".The BHA said there had been 24 13-year-old horses since 2000 who have competed in the Grand National, with no previous fatalities.Related topicsHorse RacingMore on this storyLatest horse racing resultsTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9721 viewing9.7k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
