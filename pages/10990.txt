I know how dangerous that man is, I have nothing but respect for him," said Machado Garry. "That man hits like a truck. He's been on a tear but I told everyone what I was going to do - outclass him - and I believe I did that."The 27-year-old, as he did against Rakhmonov, took the Prates fight at the start of the month at short notice.Machado Garry was seeking to bounce back from the first defeat of his nine-fight UFC career and had targeted outclassing the 31-year-old over five rounds - and that is largely what he did.Machado Garry received boos during his walkout in contrast to the popular Prates, who has become a fan favourite with four knockouts in his first four bouts. After a tentative opening few minutes, Machado Garry took advantage of a slip from Prates as he opened up a cut below his left eye with a heavy punch to the grounded Brazilian.The Irishman started to use his range effectively, landing punch combinations as he out-struck Prates and took control in the second round.A blitz of uppercuts stunned Prates in the third, who was struggling to stifle Machado Garry's movement and land any telling shots.But with the fight heading into the latter stages, Prates came alive, pressuring Machado Garry to find a home for a big left and flying knee.With minutes remaining, Prates reversed a takedown from Machado Garry before landing some big shots on the ground.The crowd roared on the action at T-Mobile Centre hoping for a finish, but Machado Garry survived until the end of the fight to secure the win on the judges' scorecards.In his post-fight interview, Machado Garry revealed he is the back-up fighter for the welterweight title fight between champion Belal Muhammad and Jack Della Maddalena at UFC 315 on 10 May."My entire goal is to prove I'm one of the most game fighters who has ever existed. I've got the fighting Irish in my blood and this is what's next for me," he added.Image source, ReutersImage caption, Prates had a four inch reach advantage but it was Machado Garry who made best use of his rangeImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Machado Garry landed most of the significant strikes in the bout but is still searching for his first stoppage win since 2023Image source, ReutersImage caption, Prates hurt Machado Garry with minutes of the fight remaining Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The win will keep Machado Garry in the top ten of the welterweight rankings, and he may even move up from his number seven positionRelated topicsMixed Martial ArtsMMA schedule and results 2025Published23 hours agoWatch every Born to Brawl episodePublished28 April 2024More MMA from the BBCNotifications, social media and more with BBC SportPublished31 JanuaryTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8894 viewing8.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
