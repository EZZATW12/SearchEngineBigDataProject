He hasn't noticed it, but the people closest to him have.Pimblett's team-mate Molly McCann, who retired last month, his coach Paul Rimmer, his wife Laura and his parents have all observed the change.They noticed it after the birth of Pimblett's identical twin daughters, Betsy and Margot, one year ago."It's given me more motivation. I'm training harder than I've ever trained now because they're in the back of my mind," Pimblett tells BBC Sport. "I need to look after them for the rest of my life, I need to put food on the table so yeah, it's changed me."All the people closest to me have said it and to be honest, I know they're not gonna lie."Liverpool's Pimblett has been training for the next big test of his career when he faces American lightweight Michael Chandler at UFC 314 in Miami, Florida on Saturday.Murphy outclasses Emmett to stay unbeaten in UFCPublished6 AprilUFC win was 15 years in the making - McKeePublished7 AprilPimblett says he has been in the gym almost "every day" since his statement first-round submission win over Bobby Green in July,  preparing for Chandler, but has also had more time to adjust to parenthood.Because Pimblett's daughters are identical, the 30-year-old would sometimes get them mixed up, so he's figured out a way to tell them apart."There's only little things that help me tell the difference but one of the big things is Margot has a bangle on her left hand and Betty has a bangle on her right hand," he adds.Pimblett responds with trademark humour when he is asked what he has learned since becoming a dad."Try and just have one baby, twins are hard work," jokes Pimblett."One of us can't just put them to bed, both of us have to be there. If one cries in the car they will wake the other one up. So yeah, it's a lot harder."'The world knows who Michael Chandler is'Pimblett is 12th in the UFC lightweight rankings following his win over Green nine months ago, while Chandler is five places above him in seventh.The 38-year-old is a former three-time Bellator lightweight champion and UFC title challenger, losing to Charles Oliveira in 2021.Since joining the UFC in 2021 - although he has lost four of his six bouts - Chandler has developed into one of the most popular fighters on the roster because of his gung-ho fighting style and willingness to trade punches with opponents.With Pimblett no stranger to fanfare, the stage is set for one of the most highly-anticipated bouts of the year."Obviously everyone in the MMA world knew who Bobby Green and Tony Ferguson were, but Michael Chandler - most of the world know who he is, never mind people who just watch MMA," said Pimblett."He's gonna come out and try and take my head off, I know he is 100%, and I'll be using my range against him."He's confident as well as I am, and I'm looking forward to putting on a show for everyone."What information do we collect from this quiz?Pimblett has won all six fights since his UFC debut in 2021 and believes he is not too far away from a lightweight title shot.Russia's Islam Makhachev holds the championship at the moment, with his win against Renato Moicano in July breaking the UFC record for most defences of the belt with four."A win will put me up to rank seven, that's the main thing. Beat Michael, then fight someone in the top five, then I'll be fighting for the title next year," said Pimblett."All my fans [believe in me]. And that's all that matters really - my friends, my family, my team-mates and my fans, I just love proving haters wrong."Related topicsMixed Martial ArtsMMA schedule and results 2025Published23 hours agoWatch every Born to Brawl episodePublished28 April 2024More MMA from the BBCNotifications, social media and more with BBC SportPublished31 JanuaryComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 49Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9719 viewing9.7k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
