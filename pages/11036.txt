"Play some Ninja Gaiden, Tekken, Dark Souls, whatever it is. And when you train, your mind is so much sharper. "There's a reason why [former UFC champions] Demetrius Johnson, Sean O'Malley and Max Holloway clock so many hours in video games."American Holloway has said he learned some striking combinations from playing the UFC video game early in his career, which he later implemented in his fights - something which the Hardwicks can relate to."There's times we'll say Demon's Wrath on pads - it's a move from the command list on Tekken. It's left high kick to jab, to right low kick to left body shot," says George.'Around 9000 calories - my real talent is eating'The Hardwicks grew up on Teesside, where they were introduced to mixed martial arts as teenagers after initially training in Muay Thai.They started the sport on exactly the same day and before long were hooked, with both deciding they wanted to pursue it as a career.The brothers' enjoy a competitive but constructive relationship, but this only blossomed after they started training together."Training was what actually fixed us, we'd be in the house scrapping, constantly having fights," said George. "When we actually started going to the gym and doing it in a controlled environment and a productive way, this channelled it into something useful rather than just breaking the furniture."The pair's bond has played a big part in their success, with both admitting one has inspired the other to stay committed to the sport during difficult moments over the years."I remember when I was going to start university, I got an elbow dislocation and then a problem with my scalp and it put me off martial arts for a while, said George."If Harry wasn't doing it I probably wouldn't have got back into it."Inside the cage they have been compared to former UFC stars Nick and Nate Diaz, because of the pressure and body shots they inflict on their opponents.George jokes they both similar in ways, joking about their "neanderthal eyebrows" and stubbornness, especially when they spar.The biggest difference between the pair, however, is their appetite.George says that his "real talent would have been competitive eating", referencing a time he ate two "Teesside Parmos, two bags of chips and a salted caramel cheesecake" - a haul totalling "around 9000 calories"."That's the reason he's in the heavier weight class than me," Harry quips.Aspinall, McGregor & the 'dream-makers' - welcome to Cage WarriorsPublished2 November 2024PFL turns to boxing's blueprint – gimmick or genius?Published20 August 2024Much of Cage Warriors' talent over the years have progressed to the UFC, and Harry and George have similar ambitions.George missed out on a UFC contract in 2023, losing to Abdul-Kareem Al-Selwady in Dana White's Contender Series, but is eyeing another shot in the near future."I'm fighting soon then I want to fight in Newcastle and then towards the back end of the year my dream is to go back through the Contender Series and get redemption," says George."There are so many mistakes I made, and I just can't wait to right them."Harry echoes the sentiment."UFC is the ideal but I'm a very content individual with the life I live now," he says. "The UFC would be good because I'd be getting more money for the life I live, more exposure, the gym would be busier, but we've got really good students and training partners here."Related topicsMixed Martial ArtsMMA schedule and results 2025Published23 hours agoWatch every Born to Brawl episodePublished28 April 2024More MMA from the BBCNotifications, social media and more with BBC SportPublished31 JanuaryTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8899 viewing8.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
