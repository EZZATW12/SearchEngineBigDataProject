A microbial electrolysis cell is essentially a device used to clean water and microbes grow on recycled carbon fibre, eating the sewage. During that process, they produce hydrogen as a by-product."WMG will use the car to try to break several land speed records, including fastest standing and flying starts over a mile and a kilometre.Dr Meredith hopes the hydrogen technology will produce the same amount of power as petrol. But the challenge, particularly when developing a car suitable for racing, is reducing the size of the storage tanks."Hydrogen is a good fuel. It's clean burning," he said. "We're starting to scale up the process and seeing just what we can do on an industrial scale. So, then in terms of actually running the car on hydrogen in a race, the biggest challenge with hydrogen is the shape of the storage tanks and how much volume it takes up."McLaren calls for sustainability changes in F1Published18 May 2023'We have taken big actions without being shy'Published27 December 2024F1 doing as much as it can for climate - NorrisPublished7 July 2023Formula 1 has made steps to make the sport more sustainable in recent years, after announcing in 2019 that it hopes to become carbon neutral by 2030.That includes more efficient engines and tweaks to the calendar to reduce the distance freight travels by plane.In 2026 new regulations will be introduced, which include smaller, nimbler cars and 100% sustainable fuel.In April, the electric car racing series Extreme E will switch from electric to hydrogen-powered cars, renaming itself Extreme H.German manufacturer BMW has announced plans to put a hydrogen car for domestic use on sale from 2028.
