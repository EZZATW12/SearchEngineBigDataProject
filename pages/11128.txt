The Morecambe rider claimed his first NW200 podium since 2012 by finishing third in a Superstock race in May.Three-time TT winner Dean Harrison joins him in the Honda awning for a second year, aiming to build on the progress he made in his first campaign with the Japanese marque.Elsewhere, Dominic Herbertson comes in to partner James Hillier under the WTF (We're The Future) Racing Honda banner and Manxman Conor Cummins has signed to compete for the Northern Ireland-based Burrows Engineering/RK Racing outfit on a BMW Superbike, taking up the berth previously occupied by Herbertson.Australian David Johnson will again be the official Kawasaki rider on machinery prepared by Lee Hardy Racing.'We've just been very unlucky' - Todd on Macau cancellationPublished19 November 2024FHO BMW and Honda Racing name 2025 rider line-upsPublished13 November 2024What of the top Northern Ireland riders?Image source, PacemakerImage caption, Lee Johnston has suffered serious injury setbacks in recent seasonsLee Johnston returned to action in the latter half of the 2024 season after recovering sufficiently from a series of serious injury setbacks in recent years.The Fermanagh native revealed in September however that the Ashcourt Racing team, with whom he had combined his role as rider with that of manager, had decided to step away from the sport.There is much interest in where the 35-year-old will end up for next year's big races following the end of his long association with Phil Reed's outfit.Michael Dunlop's future plans are always the subject of much speculation and this year is no different. Will the Ballymoney rider continue with Hawk Racing and race on Honda, Yamaha and Paton machinery again or will he seek a new challenge?Eleven-time NW200 Superbike winner Glenn Irwin will be a notable absentee from the grid for that meeting in May after announcing his retirement from road racing in October.There is optimism however that record 29-time winner Alastair Seeley will return to the north coast speed spectacular in May next year after sitting out the most recent edition because of a failure to acquire suitable competitive machinery. It's a case of 'watch this space' as to which bikes he will be riding.Other leading NI riders Paul Jordan, Adam McLean and Shaun Anderson have yet to confirm their plans.What about some other big names?Image source, PacemakerImage caption, Josh Brookes has yet to confirm whether he will compete in the 2025 road racing season while Glenn Irwin has announced his retirement from that branch of the sportWhile Nathan Harrison was absent from the official Honda Racing line-up announced in November, the Manx rider has indicated that he will be on the grid at the TT and North West, with likely continued involvement from the same manufacturer in some guise.Double BSB champion Josh Brookes clinched a second place in the Senior TT and lapped in excess of 134mph this year but his participation in the road racing scene next time out remains to be confirmed after he made the switch from FHO Racing to DAO Racing Honda for the 2025 British Superbike series.DAO Racing team manager Jonny Bagnall has indicated on his team's YouTube channel his intention to concentrate on BSB next year and "not have any distractions of road racing for 2025 at least". Will Brookes be on the grid at either or both of the big internationals? We must wait and see.Sixteen-time TT winner Ian Hutchinson rode for the Milenco by Padgett's last term but neither the rider nor the team have revealed their intentions for 2025 as yet.TAS Racing, run by father and son Hector and Philip Neill, have switched from BMW to Ducati for their forthcoming British Superbike and Supersport campaigns but have yet to formally announce whether they will compete in road racing in 2025. Republic of Ireland rider Mike Browne, KTS Racing regular Jamie Coward, Rob Hodson, last season's Bathams Racing duo Michael Rutter and Craig Neve, plus North West customary frontrunners Richard Cooper and Jeremy McWilliams are others yet to announce publicly their 2025 roads schedule.Related topicsMotorsportNorthern Ireland SportMotorbikesTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8909 viewing8.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Northern Ireland sportThe 'rugby student' stepping up to lead IrelandPre-contract agreements - why are they different in NI?Record-breaker Dunlop 'breaks mould' of modern sporting heroesMeet Jude McAtamney - the New York Giants kicker from Derry Elsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
