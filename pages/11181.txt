Both teams came out and wanted to get that win and we got over the line."We knew they were a good team and very talented and we just had to start our own jumps first."Being unbeaten feels so good. It gives us so much confidence that we feel we can beat any side out there. We can hopefully push on from here."London Pulse head coach Sam Bird: "That was a great game to be part of. Thunder were really strong and there was some really good netball all over the court."It could have gone either way, but I thought we were calmer in that critical final phase. We're still looking for improvements."Today before the game is the most relaxed we've been and I think that belief is there now. We've got over the line and got good momentum now."Thunder coach Karen Greig: "I'm super proud of the girls. We knew that today was going to be a tough ask for us, and a little bit of inexperience showed at times."But the fact is we have pushed a London Pulse team full of superstars. There was a point in that fourth quarter where we could have taken it on."We had areas where we lost focus but there's really big positives and near the halfway stage we have more to show."Best of Pulse-Thunder statsThis was just London Pulse's second victory over Manchester Thunder in 11 NSL meetings.
