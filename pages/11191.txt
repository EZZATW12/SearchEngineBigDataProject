"But when it actually stopped and I thought maybe I wouldn't be able to do this now or maybe I won't be able to get to Loughborough as much because I live in Leeds and I might have to be there more, the thought of losing it actually made me realise how grateful I am for it."And it was also a realisation that has changed Panagarry as a player."It has made me more relaxed, and I think maybe I am a highly strung person," she said."Every season, every pre-season and test I weirdly kind of enjoy because this was nearly something that got taken away from me and something I realised I needed more than ever to be the best version of myself I could be."Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Loughborough Lightning beat Manchester Thunder to win the 2024 NSL grand finalPre-season at Loughborough this year was spent getting Lightning ready to try to become the first team to win three consecutive NSL titles.Their back-to-back successes and three titles in four years has already distinguished Lightning as one of the most dominant sides in the competition's history."For us it goes back to zero and the process starts again," she said."Everyone is hunting you down and everyone wants that trophy and we like that. We have been in that position before. "We like thinking that every time we step on the court you think you are going to win, you want to perform well, you want to get top four. We talk about it, we don't hide from it and that is something I love about the club and the culture."Each year we want to be in that grand final with a chance to win that trophy."Two wins in their first three games this season has Loughborough third in the table ahead of their first East Midlands derby meeting with competition newcomers Nottingham Forest on Saturday at their Motorpoint Arena home."I'm excited and I think it will be a physical battle out there," Panagarry said."Nottingham is an amazing place, we had our opening weekend there a few years ago and I absolutely love that arena. It is one of those where you feel closer to the fans and you can feel the energy and the noise."Related topicsNetballTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8877 viewing8.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
