a new rule which in the new season will allow shooters to score two points from a dedicated area on the edge of the shooting circle during the last five minutes of each of the four quarters of every match.Scores flew back and forth but Pulse gained a 12-6 lead at half-time.Leeds looked as though they were staging a comeback, particularly through the skill of Sophie Egbaran in the second half.However, Tchine kept the scoreboard ticking to give Pulse the title.Pulse will open their NSL campaign on 16 March, while Leeds' season begins on 14 March against the Birmingham Panthers.'We want to create our own legacy' -
