These must be called by a player on court and can only be called after a goal has been scored.The NSL said tactical timeouts "will provide players and coaches with the invaluable opportunity to make critical adjustments providing the ability to change the outcome of a game and keeping fans guessing until the final whistle".Another new addition will see losing teams that finish within five goals or less of their opponent's score claim one point - a change that "aims to incentivise teams in a losing position to continue to fight until the last second of each game".In December, it was announced the NSL would follow suit with Australia's Super Netball league and introduce a two-point super shot.The rule, which will be in play throughout the new periods of extra time, allows shooters to score two points from a dedicated area on the edge of the shooting circle during the last five minutes of each of the four quarters of every match.Claire Nelson, the NSL's managing director, said the latest rule changes were tailored to "creating a fast-paced, exciting format".She added: "Not allowing games to be played to a draw, along with tactical timeouts and the introduction of the super shot are just some of the changes that will create unmissable experiences as we take new and existing fans on a journey through the season that has jeopardy and excitement at its core."The new NSL season begins on 14 March and one match per week will be shown live on the BBC.Pivotal moment for Super League - AnalysisJess Anderson, BBC Sport The announcement of these new rules comes just over a week before what organisers are calling 'Netball Super League 2.0' begins.It is a pivotal moment for the sport as it hopes to gain more fans by playing in bigger arenas and puts the wheels in motion to allow athletes to turn fully professional.Introducing four new rules is a bold move but one which, it is hoped, will increase competition in a previously fairly predictable league. CEO Nelson has made it clear Super League will use this opportunity to be innovative when it comes to increasing the entertainment factor.Inspiration has been drawn from the Australian Super Netball league - considered the best league in the world and where the super shot has been in place since 2020 - but also rugby and basketball, with a leaf taken out of the American sports book when it comes to entertainment.The rules will undoubtedly divide opinion among the netball purists but the excitement, increased fandom and, crucially, financial benefits it is hoped they will bring could mean these are changes not even the most diehard fan can argue with.Related topicsNetballTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8866 viewing8.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
