After the announcement by the IOC, Peaty posted on Instagram, saying: "50m sprint events have just been added to @la28games which confirms my attempt to be at my fourth Olympic Games. "This is the best result for our incredible sport and will allow more people to be part of it and stay in it much longer. Thank you @world_aquatics for this amazing decision."I've got a good feeling about these next three years."The six-time Olympic medallist has not been included in a group of 57 elite British swimmers that will be supported by Aquatics GB throughout 2025.After his silver medal at the Paris Olympics last summer Peaty said he would take a two-year break from the sport but would continue training.

There will also be an expanded mixed events schedule with archery, athletics (4x100m mixed relay), golf, gymnastics, rowing coastal beach sprint and table tennis all seeing mixed team events added.Rowing will have three events making their Olympic debut, with the women's solo (CW1x) and men's solo (CM1x) events and the mixed double sculls (CX2x) being introduced in a coastal beach sprint.The boulder and lead events will be contested as separate medal events in sport climbing, while the 3x3 basketball events will increase from eight teams to 12.The IOC said "gender equality was a key consideration" when deciding the schedule.
