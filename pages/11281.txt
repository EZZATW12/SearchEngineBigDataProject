The multi-sport arena, to be built in the Victoria Park area of Brisbane, will host the opening and closing ceremonies, as well as the athletics. The plans will see the new stadium become Brisbane's home for cricket, with the famous Gabba stadium to be demolished following the Games. The decision, announced by Queensland Premier David Crisafulli, comes following numerous pledges before the 2024 state elections that a new stadium would not be built. "I have to own that, and I will. I am sorry, it's my decision, and I accept that decision," said Crisafulli.The government had toyed with plans to redevelop the Gabba - which was built in 1895 and has staged 67 men's Test matches - but those plans were scrapped following a 100-day review into planning for 2032.Cricket, which is being held in Los Angeles in 2028 and is likely to be retained in 2032, could be played at the Gabba before the arena is torn down. "Wouldn't it be amazing to see the Australian cricket team win gold at an Olympic final? The Gabba's swansong," Crisafulli said. "The Gabba is at its end of life. It hasn't been well maintained, and we do need a stadium to host this great show, and there is an opportunity for legacy play."Queensland Cricket backed the plans, with chief executive Terry Svenson saying the arena had been a "wonderful venue" but its challenges were "well documented". A new 25,000-seater national aquatic centre will be built in Spring Hill near the main stadium, while a new 20,000-seater arena is planned near the main athletes village. The rowing will be held in Queensland's Fitzroy River, which is known to host saltwater crocodiles but the government says the waters are safe."If it's good enough for central Queensland kids, I reckon it's good enough for Pierre from Paris," said Crisafulli. The Brisbane Queensland Tennis Centre will receive significant upgrades in order to host tennis events.

"It really has come as a political backflip," said Levy on Tuesday."It's been really polarising for a lot of the community here in Queensland."The main stadium in Victoria Park, which will host 63,000 seats, it's one of the few green sites across Brisbane and it holds cultural significance to the Indigenous people of Brisbane, the Turrbal people. They call the place the Barrambin. "It was a native camping ground and food-gathering place. It had First Nations people from across Queensland gather all over the place for corroboree, which is the traditional dance for First Nations people. "There were protests today. There were communities that were against the development of the park to turn it into a stadium. We do imagine in the days to come there will be fallout from community groups and stakeholders that feel like this plan is not the best plan going forward."Related topicsOlympic GamesComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 447Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8931 viewing8.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
