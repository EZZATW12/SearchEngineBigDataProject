That was the extra motivation that Egyptian fencer Nada Hafez needed when she took to the piste at Paris 2024.Only a select few knew she was competing while seven months pregnant until she revealed the news on social media following her last-16 exit from her event. It made headlines the world over.The whirlwind reaction was like nothing Hafez had experienced before."I was just posting on my personal account - proud, saying I'm in the top 16 in the world while pregnant," Hafez told BBC Sport Africa. "I didn't expect this would go viral. I didn't know what was going on."The 27-year-old says the majority of responses to her message were positive."When the post went up, and I was an inspiration for everyone, this was a big thing for me."Hafez, who is a clinical pathologist, says she had been given clearance from doctors to fence at the Games and wanted to show the world what a woman's body can do."This was a really important message for me - an Egyptian Arab woman - to tell all women that your body can surprise you," she said."Sometimes you need to see an example in front of you to know that you can do it. "Because maybe a pregnant woman, she's afraid to do anything, and now she tells herself: 'There's a woman who competes at the Olympics while pregnant. So I can do whatever'."Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Hafez upset the seventh seed, Elizabeth Tartakovsky of the United States, in her first match at Paris 2024But not everyone was so supportive of Hafez revealing that she fenced in the women's individual sabre at the Grand Palais while carrying a baby.A day later Hafez put out another Instagram post to emphasise she was not the first pregnant woman to appear at an Olympics and that she had wanted to "shed light on the strength, perseverance and relentlessness" of Egyptian women.That strength came to the fore when dealing with negativity online."Some people don't want to see you succeed," she reflected."It's easy to put a comment and run. You don't face me."I wanted to clarify that I'm a doctor and this (competing while pregnant) is something that is not against any medical issues."Some people were saying I should have given the place to someone else. But this was not an option because I qualified."My mum told me 'Don't be sad if you read anything' - but I'm proud of what I did. I achieved something and it was very challenging."With fencing being a combat sport using swords, could that have provoked the negative comments?"For me, fencing is not as it looks - it has this sense of touch. My doctor assured me that it's not unsafe."Cleared by doctors to follow Paris fencing dreamImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Hafez took up fencing aged 12 and has appeared at the past three editions of the Olympic GamesCairo-based Hafez, who pursued her passion for fencing while studying for her medical degree, became an Egyptian sabre champion and went to both the Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020 Games. So, having qualified for Paris 2024, did she consider pulling out when she discovered she was pregnant? "Yes, of course. I knew I was pregnant a week before a World Cup [event], and I said, 'Okay, I won't chance it because it's my first pregnancy'," she explained."I didn't know how I would feel. "I was waiting for my husband [a cardiothoracic surgeon] to tell me to stop and take rest. But he told me: 'We'll go to the doctor. Whatever he says, we'll do.'"And the doctor said: 'You don't have a disease. You're just pregnant. If you're okay and everything is normal, you can do whatever you want.'"With that reassurance, Hafez felt ready to resume training. Mindful of the spotlight falling on her nation if the news came out, she kept it as quiet as she could."I didn't have to tell anyone, because it's not against Olympic regulations," she said."I just told the people who needed to know. The most important thing was not to go against any laws or health conditions."I didn't know if I would make it so I took it step by step until I reached the Olympics."Egypt's National Olympic Committee told BBC Sport Africa it has no rules barring pregnant women from training or competing."But it has to be a safe environment and we have to make sure there is no risk involved," an official said.Spurred on in Paris by her 'Olympic baby'  Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Nada Hafez was full of emotion after she made it through to the last 16 of the Paris Games, her third Olympics having also competed at at Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020Now a mum to four-month-old baby Zaina, Hafez can reflect on the part her daughter played in her achievements in Paris."I worked with my mental coach. I wanted to do something different for my baby," she said."I tried not to think that I have my excuse not to win. I thought differently: 'I'm pregnant and I will win', and I did it."Hafez went on to upset the seventh seed, Elizabeth Tartakovsky, 15-13."It's one of the best results for female Egyptian Olympians," Hafez added."I was crying with happiness. This is something for my baby to be proud of."She then lost 15-7 to Jeon Hayoung of South Korea in the last 16.Neither of her opponents knew Hafez was expecting. "It's unfair if someone knows. Maybe they'd be afraid to put a touch or something, so no need to tell them."Being a role model 'sets my heart on fire'Hafez, who is studying for a masters degree alongside being a new mum, is aiming to use her platform to stand up for women's rights in sport.She has not yet decided whether she wants to try and qualify for Los Angeles 2028.For now, she is still processing what she achieved in Paris."Young girls told me, 'You've inspired us so much. We want to go to medical school and continue in sports'," she said."And that made me happiest."Whenever I get a message from anyone telling me I'm a role model it sets my heart on fire - because that's what I'm working on for my whole life."I'm still young. I'm aiming to do more and be a good example as a mum."I hope my daughter will be an Olympian one day. She's a baby Olympian - and maybe she'll be an adult Olympian."Related topicsAfrica SportFencingTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8891 viewing8.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
