I will fight in the ring, I will fight in the courts and I will fight in the public eye until the truth is undeniable."What does science tell us about boxing’s gender row?Published9 August 2024Boxing controversy - what we know and what we don'tPublished3 August 2024The key questions for sport after boxing eligibility rowPublished11 August 2024The Algerian, 25, won women's welterweight gold in Paris at the Paris Olympics, a year after being disqualified from the World Championships for reportedly failing gender eligibility tests.The tests were conducted by the Russian-led IBA, who were later stripped of their world governing body status by the IOC over integrity and governance issues.At the time the IBA said Khelif "failed to meet the eligibility criteria for participating in women's competition".The IOC questioned the legitimacy and credibility of the IBA's tests, saying they could not be relied upon.The IOC was responsible for running the boxing competition at the Paris Olympics.Khelif and Taiwan's Lin Yu-ting, who was also banned by the IBA, were both cleared to compete at the Olympics by the IOC.The pair's gold medals overshadowed boxing at Paris and attracted scrutiny and criticism from around the world.Khelif said her team was now reviewing the situation and would take legal action to protect her rights.The IOC has said the IBA statement was "just another example of the IBA's campaign against the IOC".Switzerland's Attorney General's office confirmed it had received the IBA's complaint.Related topicsOlympic GamesBoxingBoxing schedule and results 2025Published1 day agoWatch every Born to Brawl episodePublished28 April 2024More boxing from the BBCNotifications, social media and more with BBC SportPublished31 JanuaryTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8967 viewing9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
