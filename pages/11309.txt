But for me, no, it's quite the opposite."I think running into Paris, I was basically just making ends meet. I was grateful to be on the National Lottery funding, but that doesn't go very far in the south of England."It was hindering what I wanted to do with my performance when you're thinking about finances the whole time. "Now looking towards LA, I definitely have felt the support of Northern Ireland again, and people wanting to reach out and support me with my journey forward and I feel very grateful. I feel like I can make a life out of this for four years."All roads point to USA for local Olympic championsImage source, BBC SportImage caption, Daniel Wiffen, Jack McMillan, Rhys McClenaghan and Hannah ScottScott returned to training in January and is open to what 2025 will bring.With Great Britain trials not until April and the World Championships in Shanghai in September there is plenty of time to worry about which boat she ends up in, subject to selection."To be someone from Northern Ireland and a woman from Northern Ireland, if I could come back with two medals at some point in my future, gosh, everything has to go right, to even say that, but it would be a really cool feat and it's something that I think is a new challenge."To do that and pave the way for a Northern Irish woman, I think would be really special."One of four Olympians from Northern Ireland to win a gold medal last summer, Scott joins the other three - swimmers Daniel Wiffen and Jack McMillan and gymnast Rhys McClenaghan - in confirming their Olympic journeys are continuing, an exciting prospect for local sports fans."We'll see in the future how the four of us go, but for Northern Ireland, it's great," added Scott."I'm so proud to be from here and that's why another reason why I want to do it again."Related topicsNorthern Ireland SportRowingOlympic GamesTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8967 viewing9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Northern Ireland sportThe 'rugby student' stepping up to lead IrelandPre-contract agreements - why are they different in NI?Record-breaker Dunlop 'breaks mould' of modern sporting heroesMeet Jude McAtamney - the New York Giants kicker from Derry Elsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
