"So I grabbed my dog and some dog food, and that was it."Could I have stayed 30 seconds longer and maybe got the medals? I wasn't willing to take that risk."Bach said in a post on X that Hall will be given replica medals."We are in full solidarity with the citizens of Los Angeles and full of admiration for the tireless work of the firefighters and the security forces," he said."Currently the full focus must be on the fight against the fires and the protection of the people and property."We have also learned that a great Olympian, Gary Hall Jr has lost his medals in the fire. The IOC will provide him with replicas."LA fires death toll rises to 24 as high winds expectedPublished13 JanuaryHow one street in LA went up in flamesPublished12 JanuaryWhat we know about LA fires victimsPublished15 JanuaryMeanwhile, the Los Angeles Clippers' coach Tyronn Lue said it was a "difficult" time as his side prepared to return to action on Monday.Hi side are set to host the Miami Heat while the Los Angeles Lakers are at home to the San Antonio Spurs.The NBA had postponed the Lakers' game against the Charlotte Hornets on Thursday and called off Lakers and Clippers home games on Saturday saying they did not want to divert resources from the wildfire response.JJ Redick, coach of the Lakers, was among those whose houses were destroyed in the Palisades fire."People are losing their homes, people are losing schools, losing lives," said Lue. "It's very difficult to focus in on basketball because life is bigger than basketball."He was also asked if he thought playing on Monday was the right call with the death toll from the fires now at 24 and three wildfires still burning in the LA area. An evacuation order affecting more than 100,000 people is still in place with high winds forecast for the area over the coming days."It's above my pay grade," Lue said. "I think the NBA, they have a good handle on things that's going on and what they need to do. So they make the decision."They know we're going through a tough time right now in the state of California and they understand that."Hopefully we can bring some kind of joy with the game coming back tomorrow," he added, "[we can] try to put some smiles on people's faces in tough times."Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8955 viewing9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
