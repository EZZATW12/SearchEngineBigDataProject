The exact motive for the murder was not clear but at the time of the arrests the police had said it was robbery.On Monday, in an emotional request to the court, the athlete’s mother had asked Justice Nyakundi to hand down life sentences.She talked about how her son, who started his career running barefoot, had worked hard to become an international runner and the family’s breadwinner, the Nation newspaper reports.“My son had 8,000 [Kenyan] shillings ($62; £48) and an expensive mobile phone, but the killers did not take any of the property from him. Their mission was to painfully finish him,” the newspaper quotes her as saying.Despite not acceding to the family’s request for life sentences, they said they were happy with the outcome and that justice had been served.Kiplagat, who was 34 when he died, reached the final of the 3,000m steeplechase at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. He also competed in the following two Games and is the holder of the Ugandan record at the event.You may also be interested in:Thousands mourn Ugandan Olympian killed by ex-partnerAgnes Tirop: Family await justice a year on from Kenyan runner's murderDamaris Muthee Mutua: Murdered runner's career 'was picking up'Kelvin Kiptum: The Kenyan marathon runner destined for greatnessGetty Images/BBCGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafricaBBC Africa podcastsAfrica DailyFocus on AfricaKenyaUgandaAfricaRelated'They aimed to kill' - BBC identifies security forces who shot Kenya anti-tax protesters10 hrs agoAfricaGirl, 14, killed by lion in Kenya8 days agoAfricaAnt smugglers caught with hundreds of prized insects in Kenya14 Apr 2025AfricaMore1 hr agoNamibian minister sacked after being accused of rape Mac-Albert Hengari was arrested on Saturday after allegedly attempting to bribe the woman to withdraw the case.1 hr agoAfrica15 hrs agoSouth Africa will defend sovereignty, ANC chair says as tensions with US growThe ANC chair's comments come after months of US tension over race relations and land law.15 hrs agoAfrica23 hrs agoEnd conflict to honour Pope, Vatican diplomat tells South SudanThe Vatican's representative to South Sudan says the Pope's memory should be honoured by seeking peace.23 hrs agoAfrica1 day ago'Double patriarchy': doctor has South Africa talking about financial abuseA medic sparks a national conversation about the financial abuse some female breadwinners face.1 day agoAfrica2 days agoDR Congo and Rwanda vow to agree peace plan within daysThe two neighbouring nations sign a US-brokered deal aimed at stopping the fighting in eastern DR Congo.2 days agoAfricaBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.
