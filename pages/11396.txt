We have worked hard to be here so we will keep maintaining that."Salford: Brierley; Connell, Marsters, Vaughan, Thewlis; Nikorima, Mellor; Ormondroyd, Davis, Makin, Hellewell, Shorrocks, WilsonInterchanges: Hill, Sangare, Morgan, WarrenLeigh: Hodgson; McIntosh, Badrock, Brand, Charnley; O'Brien, Lam; Trout, McNamara, Mulhern, O'Neill, Hughes, LiuInterchanges: Brogan, Wilde, Davis, DwyerReferee: Liam RushRelated topicsSalford Red DevilsLeigh LeopardsRugby LeagueComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 48Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9900 viewing9.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
