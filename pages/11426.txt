Not just the result but the performance," Wellens told BBC Radio Merseyside."Some soul searching needs to be done both individually and collectively because it's way off the standard we need to be."I'm responsible for the results and performances of this team. I've never, for one second, shied away from that."Ashton hat-trick gives Wire victory over St HelensPublished3 days agoSaints opened their season with four wins from four in all competitions, during which they scored a cumulative 192 points and conceded just 12.Since then, however, they have lost five out of eight games, are out of the Challenge Cup and have dropped to fifth in the Super League table, four points off leaders Hull KR."For the second week in a row we've started really sloppy in a game," Wellens said. "We've coughed up cheap possession, I can't keep talking about that, we've got to fix it up."We've done so much great work in pre-season and the early rounds and tried to implement things to improve our attack."But to get the opportunity to attack, you need to keep hold of the ball and turn up with a defensive attitude and resilience to earn the right to play and we did neither of those tonight and it needs to be better."Wellens has identified one area where his side can improve off the back of their recent inconsistent run, however."We have a tendency as a team, and it's something we need to eradicate, that when we are frustrated we want to go and solve things on our own and do things individually," he said."Nothing good ever comes from that. That's one thing to work on. You solve things by doing things together as a team. But that's just one thing amongst a number of things we need to fix up."Related topicsRugby LeagueSt HelensTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9939 viewing9.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
