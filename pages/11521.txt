But O'Sullivan quickly regained his form as he won the remaining six frames on Sunday, aided by runs of 79, 80, 105, 135 and 62.Belgian Brecel produced one of the most remarkable sessions at the Crucible on Saturday evening. Having arrived at the venue only 25 minutes before play was due to start after flying on a private jet from his home country, he lost the opening frame before winning seven in a row with a sensational display of attacking snooker.He continued where he had left off on Sunday.Scores of 53, 75 and 56 helped him win four consecutive frames to leave the score at 11-1, although Ding showed good character to take three of the next four, ending with back-to-back centuries of 107 and 110.Elsewhere, world number one Judd Trump holds a 10-6 lead over 2005 world champion Shaun Murphy in a match that saw Trump win £100,000 for reaching 100 centuries in a season.All the updates from day nine of the World ChampionshipTrump pockets £100,000 prize for 100 centuriesPublished13 hours ago'Class of 92' shine on thrilling day at the CruciblePublished1 day ago'I'm so proud of myself,' says Zhao after winImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Zhao Xintong's previous best run at the Crucible came in 2022 when he went out in the last 16China's Zhao Xintong moved into the quarter-finals for the first time in his career thanks to a 13-10 win over Lei Peifan.Leading 10-6 after the second session, 27-year-old Zhao looked on course for a maximum 147 in the opening frame of the day and potted nine reds and nine blacks before his break ended on 72.He was 41-12 ahead in frame 20, only for Lei to win that and the next two frames as Lei, who beat 2024 world champion Kyren Wilson in round one, threatened a comeback.But a break of 54 saw Zhao clinch victory to set up a quarter-final against England's Chris Wakelin, a player that has already eliminated 2010 world champion Neil Robertson and former world number one Mark Allen."I'm so happy, that's the first time into the quarter-finals and I'm so proud of myself," he said. "In the first round he [Lei] came back against Kyren Wilson so I knew I wasn't ready to win and I needed to be strong."I just want to go through the Crucible and I need to try my best and enjoy it as it is very nice, the crowd is nice and I want to stay longer. This is my first time to play Chris Wakelin, I know he is really good player."In June 2023, Zhao, a former UK Championship winner, was one of 10 Chinese players to receive bans for their involvement in match-fixing.He served a 20-month ban and has been the only player to return after he had not directly thrown a match but accepted charges of being a party to another player fixing two matches and betting on matches himself.Zhao is officially classed as an amateur for this tournament, but had already ensured his return to the World Snooker Tour full-time next season.In the day's other tie, China's Si Jiahui holds a 9-7 lead over England's Ben Woollaston, who defeated world number four Mark Selby in the opening round.Si, a semi-finalist two years ago, began the session with a 5-3 lead and the two players alternated the frames as the Chinese player eventually managed to hold on to his two-frame lead.Woollaston made the better breaks of the evening with a 100 in frame 13 and an 85 in frame 15, but Si snatched what could be a crucial 16th frame on the black to gain the advantage.The match will be played to a finish on Monday from 13:00 BST with the winner to face either O'Sullivan or Pang in the quarter-finals.Related topicsSnookerMore on this storyWorld Championship: Schedule, results & BBC coveragePublished13 hours agoComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 287Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8108 viewing8.1k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
