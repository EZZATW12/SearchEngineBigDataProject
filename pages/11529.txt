He has also been struggling with what he termed "stage fright".On Saturday, O'Sullivan begins his second-round match against 25-year-old Chinese player Pang Junxu, who beat Zhang Anda in his opener.The contest begins at 14:30 BST and spans three sessions across three days, finishing on Monday evening.As long as O'Sullivan's focus holds, his prospects look increasingly good because his game appeared in decent shape against Carter.It does his trophy chances no harm that Kyren Wilson, Mark Selby and Mark Allen have all been knocked out of his half of the draw.Hendry already likes O'Sullivan's chances.He told World Snooker Tour's Snooker Club podcast: "Even though he will deflect away from his chances of winning this thing, I think the way he played [against Carter] definitely shows he is a contender."So I'm really looking forward to seeing how he plays the rest of the championship."Six-time champion Steve Davis considers snooker's 17-day 'marathon of the mind' an altogether fresh challenge now the first-round stage has been navigated.Speaking on BBC Four, Davis said those who have passed that examination of their credentials should be able to compete without feeling overly worried now the matches have shifted from best-of-19 to best-of-25-frame contests.There is greater scope for recovering from a dip in form over the longer matches."I don't think you approach it differently, but you are more relaxed from not having the panic of the first round," Davis said."You know you've got to have an overnight sleep on a lead or a deficit and that can sometimes play its part."But just to be more relaxed, in as much as you've got a longer match, is handy, because you don't have anywhere near as much of a panic if you have a bad mini-session or session."At the age of 49, O'Sullivan would be snooker's oldest world champion if he takes the title on 5 May. He already holds that record following his victory against Judd Trump three years ago.Returning O'Sullivan feared Crucible 'meltdown'Published4 days agoKeeping up with the Woollastons - snooker's family affairPublished2 days agoHearn ready for snooker to leave Crucible after 2027Published3 days agoWhat about life after pro tour snooker for O'Sullivan?The 'Rocket' has been planning for a future beyond his playing career for several years, taking on lucrative work in the media and with academy projects.O'Sullivan says he wants to find new champions in the sport's biggest heartlands."I help out with the academy in Saudi Arabia and I'm enjoying the work I do there. Hopefully I can do something similar with some young kids in the UK and China," he said."That's where my true love is, to help people, help snooker players."I'm really enjoying it and that's not a distraction for me. It's practising and playing,"We need to put some academies in place here. How do we get funding? I would love to see one in Wales with Mark Williams, one in Scotland with John Higgins, one in [England] with me and one in Ireland with Ken Doherty, get the kids from as young as seven or eight and send them to the academies, put in nine or 10 Star tables in there and get the kids playing."I don't know how funding works, I'm sure there are ways. Even if I was not playing I would still be in snooker, coming here as support for a top player to help him win a World Championship."Related topicsSnookerMore on this storyWorld Championship: Schedule, results & BBC coveragePublished13 hours agoWhy is snooker played in silence?Published5 days agoQuiz: What happened in round one at the Crucible?Published3 days agoTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8972 viewing9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
