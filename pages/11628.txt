"I feel amazing," Nowacki told BBC Sport."To be able to race against the best people in the country and come out with a with a bronze in the 100m and a bronze in the 50m is something special."It really goes to show that hard work pays off."The 100m was good, a massive PB and the 50m again a massive PB, and I think it's given me a bit of confidence going forward into 200m on Saturday."Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Filip Nowacki is planning to race for Jersey at the 2025 Island Games in OrkneyNowacki's first senior medals cap an excellent few years for the Millfield School student.In 2024 he broke the British age-group record for 16-year-olds in the 100m and 200m breaststroke and won a silver medal at the European Junior Championships over the longer distance.It came after he became the first Jersey sportsperson to win three Commonwealth Youth Games medals, in Trinidad and Tobago in 2023, before following that up with a silver medal at the European Youth Olympics.It has led to him being selected as a Team GB Podium Potential athlete, meaning he is thought to have the ability to make the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles."It really goes to show that anything can be done if you really put your mind to it," he said of his selection for the Team GB programme. "I was really happy, having gained that support that I now get."I get specialist nutritionists that help me and guide me through what I need to eat and what I need to intake every day to make sure I become the best athlete I can, along with psychologists and physios as well."Nowacki's next focus is the European Junior Championships in July, followed by representing Jersey at the Island Games for the first time."In 2023 I was really gutted that I couldn't go because I had a different competition that clashed with it and I had to pick the other one," he said. "It's very important. I've only really represented Jersey once in Trinidad and Tobago and I'm really looking forward to representing Jersey again at the Island Games."Related topicsSwimmingTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8295 viewing8.3k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
