"I'm lucky to have a fantastic family around me, girlfriend, my team. "It's been really tough. The last few days have been a real mental battle - I've been fighting a lot more demons than I thought I would be. "Well done to these guys stood beside me - they are doing a fantastic job to be racing at the level they are racing at at their age."Former Commonwealth Games champion Ross Murdoch was in the same team as Goodburn at Birmingham 2022 and told BBC Scotland: "What we are seeing is a testament to his character. His resilience is incredible. "Archie is very intelligent and very performance-driven. You can see that from the way he is improving."Related topicsSwimmingMore on this storySwimmer Goodburn diagnosed with inoperable brain tumoursPublished27 June 2024Olympians to battle for titles at GB ChampionshipsPublished13 AprilBBC to broadcast Aquatics GB Swimming ChampionshipsPublished4 AprilTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9135 viewing9.1k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Scottish sportWhat is still to be decided as season reaches climax?League reconstruction - why, when & what might it look like?Scotland men's internationals to be shown live on BBCCommonwealth Games: Why is it so special to be part of Team Scotland?From titles to tinpottery - rank Scotland's top 10 clubsElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
