Winning a silver medal is a big boost for GB," Thorpe said. Carrying on mothers' legacy to achieve British firstImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Kate Shortman and Izzy Thorpe hugged each other in disbelief after realising they had won a medalShortman and Thorpe, who are both from Bristol, have known each other since they were little and have been swimming together since the age of nine.Thorpe's mum Karen competed alongside Shortman's mother Maria in the 1980s and narrowly missed out on qualifying for the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta.Shortman told the BBC earlier this year that she and Thorpe hoped to "carry on the legacy" of their mothers in Paris.They have not only done that, but also made history.Britain's previous best finish in artistic swimming - formerly synchronised swimming - was the fourth place achieved by Caroline Holmyard and Carolyn Wilson in Los Angeles in 1984, when the event made its Olympic debut.Their Olympic medal has been brewing for a while, having become the first Britons to win a duet medal at the World Championships earlier this year - where they took a silver and bronze.Their rise has been helped by an overhaul of the sport's scoring system last year, which made it less subjective and played more to their technical strengths.There are now two judging panels, looking at the elements of a routine and artistic impression, while the pairs declare the difficulty of their routine themselves before swimming.The previous system had 15 judges who scored across every aspect.Shortman had considered quitting the sport before the change and the duo's Rising Phoenix routine is a tribute to the scoring system change, which has now yielded the reward of an Olympic medal.They are not sure how they will celebrate the success yet, with Thorpe saying "it's all very overwhelming" at the moment, although she has managed to hug her mum already."Probably just stare at the medal, cry, touch the medal," Shortman said with a laugh.Related topicsSwimmingOlympic GamesArtistic SwimmingMore on this storyToday's Olympics guidePublished10 August 2024Full Paris Olympics scheduleBBC's Paris Olympics TV schedulePublished26 July 2024Comments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 233Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9075 viewing9.1k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
