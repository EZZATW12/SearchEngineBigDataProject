Can I still go to watch the Olympics in Paris? The gags show that France is looking to “laud someone who seems so dedicated and sincere in his sport, and way of life”, explained Andrew Hussey, a historian of French culture, who added that many saw Marchand as representing a contrast to the country’s politicians.The athlete's heroics were proving a welcome distraction during the crisis, said Parisians lounging on the grass in one of the city’s parks, watching the sporting action on a big screen.“We don’t want to think about the problems,” said a woman named Thanh. “We don’t want to think about the division in the country.” The swimmer had helped to “smooth everything”.Louis agreed: “When Marchand was racing, it was the most important thing for the country for a while.”Thanh (left, with friend Anne-Sophie and daughter Thanh) said Marchand was a welcome distractionPolitics seem to be largely on hold for the Games, after President Emmanuel Macron said negotiations over the formation of a new government would have to wait until after the Paralympics.Mr Macron is among those who have been to roar on Marchand in person. On Friday night, the arena was filled with deafening roars of “allez” (“go”) each time the golden boy’s swimming cap bobbed above water as he powered to glory in the 200m medley.But anyone seriously hoping that Marchand will stick his head above the political parapet looks likely to be disappointed.The swimmer, who trains in the US, has avoided wading into public debate. That contrasts with another national hero, football star Kylian Mbappé, who memorably used a Euro 2024 press conference to urge a vote against the far-right.Getty ImagesAustralian Cathy Freeman became another home hero during the Sydney Olympics in 2000The tradition of a population galvanising around a hero is as old as the Games itself, according to Philip Barker, the editor of the Journal of Olympic History.Some host nations' sporting heroes have inspired lasting change, Barker said. He cited Cathy Freeman, an Aboriginal runner who celebrated her 400m sprint win in Syndey in 2000 with the Australian and Aboriginal flags, as prompting an spirit of inclusivity from Australians towards the indigenous population "that hadn't really existed before".During the 2012 Games in London, Jessica Ennis-Hill, Greg Rutherford and Mo Farah were lionised after bagging a quick flurry of golds in what was quickly dubbed “super Saturday”.But the UK’s “golden era” of solidarity was fairly short-lived, Barker said, pointing to the political divisions that characterised the Scottish independence and Brexit referendums in the following years.One specialist in contemporary French politics agreed that the unifying effect of Marchand and his fellow French medallists was unlikely to last for long.“We can expect an immediate return to a fractured political field and a disgruntled electorate as soon as the Games are over,” said Emile Chabal, a professor of contemporary history at the University of Edinburgh.“No amount of Marchand-mania - and we've seen this before with great French sporting stars like [Zinedine] Zidane or Mbappé - will stop that,” he said.Getty ImagesFans unable to watch Marchand in person have glued themselves to screens elsewhere in ParisBut for the last week, Marchand’s compatriots have been glued to his exploits – so much so that even those who have paid good money for Olympic tickets have spent some of those events watching his races on their phones.That applied to one Parisian in the fan park, Audrey, who admitted she had torn her eyes away from a volleyball match to witness Marchand claim one of his golds on her screen.Although France had found a new hero, it was possible that “maybe next week there will be another Marchand”, Audrey pointed out. And at any rate, Marchand was just a part of something bigger.“It’s not just about him,” she said, citing the “amazing” opening ceremony.France should be “very proud about what we are showing to the world” with the Olympics, she said.What's happening and when at the Paris Olympics?How to follow Paris 2024 Olympics across the BBCEuropeFranceRelatedMan who died after collapsing on Errigal named6 mins agoEuropeCritical week for US's future in Ukraine-Russia talks, Rubio says2 hrs agoWorldEighty years on, survivors and families remember horrors of Bergen Belsen16 hrs agoEuropeMore4 days agoTeenage girl killed in French school stabbing attackFrench President Emmanuel Macron praised the "courage" of the teachers who restrained the attacker. 4 days agoEurope5 days agoFrench PM stunned as daughter reveals she was abused at scandal-hit schoolHélène Perlant alleges that a priest at Notre-Dame de Bétharram beat her at a summer camp when she was 14.5 days agoEurope18 Apr 2025Eurostar trains hit by delays ahead of Easter weekendEurostar says the delays were caused by an "overhead power issue" with several trains between Paris or Brussels and London affected.18 Apr 2025London18 Apr 2025British man, 27, killed by avalanche in French Alps The man was near the roadside at the Val Thorens resort when he was swept 15 metres (50ft) in an avalanche, officials say. 18 Apr 2025Europe17 Apr 2025Heavy snow blocks Alpine resorts in Switzerland and FranceA Swiss ski resort is cut off and people have been told to stay indoors in the French resort of Tignes.17 Apr 2025EuropeBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.
