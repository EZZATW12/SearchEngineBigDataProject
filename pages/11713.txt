I just heard the crowd and everyone just started jumping around, so I thought it was a safe bet that I could throw my stuff in the air. It was pure adrenaline."Panthers edge Devils 4-3 in Elite League Grand Final overtime thrillerPublished20 AprilFossier helping Panthers hit high notes in hunt for EIHL titlePublished3 AprilStewart sign new deal with play-off bound PanthersPublished10 AprilPanthers' play-off title win made for a glorious end to Danny Stewart's first season in charge of the club.He had Nottingham in contention for the league title going into the final weekend of the regular season before finishing third, and had taken the club to the Challenge Cup semi-finals earlier in the season.It was all enough to earn the former Coventry Blaze boss a new contract on the eve of the play-off series.What followed from there was a scintillating 8-6 aggregate victory against Guildford Flames in the quarter-finals - secured with a 6-3 second-leg win at home - before getting past fierce rivals Sheffield Steelers via an overtime semi-final win, sealed with a goal from retiring captain Sam Herr."There were a lot highs and lows like I'd never seen before," said Stewart of the way Panthers went on to clinch the trophy."Before the weekend that is what we talked about, just riding the highs and lows. "It's easier said than done, but credit to the guys for going out there and doing it."Related topicsIce HockeyTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9197 viewing9.2k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
