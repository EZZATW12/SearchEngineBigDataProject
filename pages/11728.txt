So I just decided to go in, have fun and enjoy it, as this might be one of my last competitions."Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Freeriders have to plot their own route from the summit to a finish gate using photos and drone footage. They only have one run at each event and are not allowed to practise on the courseFrom fears of missing out, to winning the biggest prizeBramwell was bottom of the overall standings with two events of the regular season remaining - only the top 60% of the field would make it through to the FWT final in the Swiss resort of Verbier and retain their pro licence for the 2025-26 season.He claimed successive overall third-place finishes in 2021 and 2022, but had struggled since missing the 2023 campaign with a broken ankle and looked set to lose his place in the FWT top tier for what promises to be a transformative year for the sport.The tour is joining forces with the International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS), which runs the World Cup programmes in alpine skiing, as well as freestyle skiing and snowboarding.Developments planned for 2026 include the first Freeriding World Championships, while an application will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee today (Monday, 31 March) to request inclusion in the 2030 Winter Games in France.Bramwell faced the prospect of missing out on the wealth of opportunities about to open up to the top riders, but he still had one more chance to redeem himself - and this time his stars aligned.Throwing caution to the wind, he aced his run in Georgia to claim just the second win of his career and first in five years. A second-placed finish in the next event in Austria saw him jump to third place in the overall standings and qualify for the tour final.Even better was to come in the sport's spiritual home of Verbier, where Bramwell produced a jaw-dropping run to win FWT's blue-riband event."I guess I just earned so much confidence from that win in Georgia," he explained."Every time I am up at the start I am asking myself 'what am I doing here?'."Standing at the start gate is stressful, but as soon as you drop in I am like 'OK, this is what I love to do'."But for the final, I was the least nervous, I would say, because I had already saved my snowboarding career for at least another 12 months."Image source, Levy Loye/FWTImage caption, "Freeriding is such a mind game," says Bramwell, centre, pictured celebrating his win in Verbier. "It's so unknown. It's obviously a dangerous sport - you don't want to mess yourself up. Getting down after a good run is the most mind-blowing feeling."'To be an Olympian would be the craziest dream'With the shackles off, Bramwell began his descent of Verbier's Bec des Rosses with an audacious backflip over an exposed rocky outcrop, then navigated a breakneck passage through a narrow gully, hurtling through a cascading shower of falling snow before ending with a soaring 360-degree jump.Judges score each competitor on the difficulty of the line they choose down the mountain, the fluidity, control and technique shown in their run and the style of their jumps, as well as the amount of time they spend in the air.Bramwell claimed victory in Verbier with an impressive score of 92.67 out of 100, and moved from rock bottom after three events to finish the season in second place overall."Winning the whole tour would have been amazing, but at least now we have some more chances," added Bramwell. "The Xtreme Verbier is the most legendary freeride competition, so to win that for the first time is the biggest dream ever."The Briton is now looking forward to a much brighter future, and the potential to one day step on to an Olympic podium.That possibility is by no means assured, but FIS told BBC Sport that it was finalising documents to put forward freeride as an Olympic discipline for the 2030 Winter Games, with the International Olympic Committee due to make a decision in December.FIS secretary general Michel Vion said: "From FIS' standpoint, freeride clearly meets all the evaluation criteria, including a strong position on promoting sustainability and environmental responsibility. Freeride is ready to bring value to the Olympic movement."Bramwell was born in Sweden and grew up in the mountain resort of Are with Swedish mother Anneli Stridsberg and English father Peter Bramwell, who was originally from Norwich. He switched to represent Britain in 2021 and says he would love to one day compete in the Olympics in GB colours. "To be an Olympian would be the craziest dream ever, that would be so cool," added Bramwell."My goal is the Olympics, but there is a lot going on in this sport and I just want to be along for the ride."Related topicsWinter SportsSnowboardingMore on this storyGB's Atkin wins women's world freeski halfpipe goldPublished30 MarchGB's Bankes wins snowboard cross silver at WorldsPublished28 March'What is happening?' - Snowboarders struggle to open Champagne bottlePublished30 MarchTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9197 viewing9.2k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
