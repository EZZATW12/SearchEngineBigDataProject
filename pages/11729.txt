Canadian Hall of Famer Gretzky broke the record previously held by his compatriot Gordie Howe in 1994.Washington Capitals' Ovechkin scored the historic goal against the New York Islanders on Sunday, with Gretzky in attendance. The game was paused for almost 20 minutes as players and spectators acknowledged the historic moment. Ovechkin was joined by NHL commissioner Gary Bettman and four-time Stanley Cup winner Gretzky, who said: "I can tell you first hand, I know how hard it is to get 894 - [so] 895 is pretty special."They say records are made to be broken but I'm not sure who's gonna get more goals than that."Ovechkin celebrated with his team-mates, completed a lap of the arena and then shook hands with his Islanders opponents before being joined by his family."What a moment for hockey, what a moment for myself," Ovechkin said."Finally no-one's gonna ask me about 'when you're gonna do it'. It's over right now."The achievement was celebrated in Moscow-born Ovechkin's homeland too, with the Russian Olympic Committee and Russian President Vladimir Putin's economic envoy Kirill Dmitriev among those posting on social media.His feat is all the more remarkable given that his season was interrupted for a few weeks when he broke his leg in November.Ovechkin tied with Gretzky on Friday, during the Capitals' 4-3 win over the Chicago Black Hawks.Who is Alex Ovechkin?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Alex Ovechkin made his NHL debut in 2005Ovechkin has been a mainstay for Washington Capitals since his NHL debut in October 2005, helping them to their only Stanley Cup victory in 2017-18, and becoming one of the greats.He has now passed the 40-goal mark in 14 of his 20 NHL seasons, despite missing a month of this campaign with a fractured fibula.Known for his passionate celebrations and relaxed attitude towards the strict diets expected in the modern game, his face is plastered across the league's marketing material.But it is the nation's capital where his star truly shines, and with the Capitals having already qualified for the post-season play-offs, he may soon be writing his name in the city's history books once again.Who previously held the NHL goals record?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Wayne Gretzky and Gordie Howe are the two previous holders of the NHL goals recordOvechkin is passing an all-time great - indeed, Gretzky was given the rather straightforward nickname of 'The Great One' during his career.The Canadian played 21 seasons in the NHL between 1979 and 1999 predominantly for the Edmonton Oilers and Los Angeles Kings.Gretzky has held the NHL goals record since he scored his 802nd on 23 March 1994, passing the total of post-war icon Howe, his compatriot and hero.While he may have lost that record, Gretzky still holds the league record for the most overall points and assists.Ovechkin may have edged closer, but 'The Great One' remains out on his own.Who has scored the most goals in the NHL?1 - Alex Ovechkin (Rus, 2005-) - 8952 - Wayne Gretzky (Can, 1979-99) - 8943 - Gordie Howe (Can, 1946-80) - 8014 - Jaromir Jagr (Cze, 1990-2018) - 7665 - Brett Hull (US, 1986-2006) - 741Related topicsIce HockeyTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions10065 viewing10k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
