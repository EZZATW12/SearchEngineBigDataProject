Again, I think we showed it before in this season and I think this was the biggest challenge so far coming back from a 2-1 loss at the Emirates against this top team with so much quality."Coming out here so calm and composed with so much belief in what we're doing and courage on the pitch. I'm so proud of the players, they've been working incredibly hard."Against a top team momentum is going to shift, and you can see that today. I think we had really strong phases in the game and that's also a challenge to stay balanced and keep on making the right decisions, especially against a team like Lyon who have so much threat. But then we also had to face the phases when they have the threat and we had to stay very level and calm in our heads, stick to the task and regulate our emotions on the pitch. The concentration was so good today."Last week we couldn't finish or set up the situations to create big enough chances and I think we adjusted that today. When we find the right places, play in the right rhythm, you see the quality of the players in the squad."On facing Barcelona in the final: "I look forward to it. Barcelona is a fantastic football team and we respect them and we really look forward to the challenge. We are going to do everything to prepare really well for the final, but we play Aston Villa soon, so that's the next one."922Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingPostpublished at 19:47 British Summer Time 27 April19:47 BST 27 AprilFT: Lyon 1-4 Arsenal (agg 3-5)Arsenal had lost each of their four semi-finals since winning the competition in 2006-07.Not this time.Image source, Getty Images1432Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRead today's reportspublished at 19:44 British Summer Time 27 April19:44 BST 27 AprilFT: Lyon 1-4 Arsenal (agg 3-5)It's been a day of two very different fortunes for English clubs in the Women's Champions League.Chelsea crashed out against Barcelona, Arsenal beat Lyon.Click the scores below to find each match report.Chelsea 1-4 Barcelona (agg 2-8)Lyon 1-4 Arsenal (agg 3-5)512Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharing'Today was unexplainable'published at 19:42 British Summer Time 27 April19:42 BST 27 AprilFT: Lyon 1-4 Arsenal (agg 3-5)LyonLyon Boss Joe Montemurro spoke to DAZN after defeat against his former side Arsenal: "A lot things [went wrong].

She's playing higher up the pitch. I can't believe she's still playing at this level and getting better and better. It's because of her attitude and application. Her and Caldentey's relationship, having the licence to go and attack, using her body, her calmness keeping the ball. When she got emotional at the end, I've never seen that. She's a classy player and person.1927Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharing'At our best we can beat anyone'published at 19:22 British Summer Time 27 April19:22 BST 27 AprilFT: Lyon 1-4 Arsenal (agg 3-5)ArsenalKim Little, who won the UEFA player of the match, spoke to DAZN after Sunday's victory: "It means a lot to this incredible football club.
