It was carefully chosen to add to the sum of knowledge gained from previous sample returns - the last of which was conducted by a Soviet probe in 1976.The OU team at Milton Keynes plan to use the lunar materials to determine the amount and isotopic composition of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and noble gases in Chang'e-5 samples.The results will be used to evaluate the giant-impact origin of the Moon and develop new insights into the history of volatiles such as carbon and nitrogen in the Earth-Moon system, the OU said.This is the first time lunar samples returned by a Chinese space mission will have been allocated to international principal investigators, said the OU.Getty ImagesThe European Space Agency said the Chang'e-5 lunar samples provided a unique window into the history of the solar systemProf Anand said being chosen was "a great honour and privilege for my team"."This is a recognition of our world-leading lunar sample research, underpinned by long-term funding from the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC/UKRI) and the OU's commitment towards maintaining world-class analytical laboratories," he said.A spokesperson for the Chinese National Space Agency (CNSA), said sharing the samples was "win-win cooperation"."The international sharing of lunar samples and joint research efforts enable scientists from around the world to study the Moon's formation and evolution, fostering collaborative exploration of the universe's mysteries," they said.Dr James Carpenter, head of the lunar science office at the European Space Agency, said: "The Chang'e-5 lunar samples provide a unique window into the history of the Solar System, and the Open University is one of the best places in the world to unravel the scientific story that's these samples have to tell."Follow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.More on this storyChina's Moon mission returned youngest ever lavasChina's Chang'e-5 mission returns Moon samplesRelated internet linksThe Open UniversityEuropean Space AgencyThe Open UniversityUniversitiesChinaMilton KeynesThe MoonSpace explorationChina Moon missionRelatedWoman, 79, notches up third degree7 days agoTeesStatue plans to honour Open University founder28 Feb 2025Beds, Herts & BucksOpen University lecturers in contract row - union13 Dec 2024Beds, Herts & BucksMore12 hrs agoBeijing seizes tiny sandbank in South China SeaThe Philippines, which disputes China's claim to the sandbank, responds by releasing a photo of its own forces on another.12 hrs agoAsia2 days agoNasa mission's out of this world for PhD studentDuncan Lyster, from Ross-on-Wye, is working with Nasa to study the ancient asteroids of Jupiter.2 days agoHereford & Worcester2 days agoNew Hindu temple will be 'open to everyone'A stone blessing ceremony is held at the site of the mandir in Milton Keynes.2 days agoBeds, Herts & Bucks3 days agoMan shot dead by police 'might have called 999'David Joyce might have called 999 to report a gunman before he was killed, the police watchdog says.3 days agoBeds, Herts & Bucks3 days agoChina has halted rare earth exports, can Australia step up?Australia has proposed to create a strategic reserve of critical minerals.3 days agoWorldBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.
