It changes our position in the standings a lot."On the red card: "It is common sense. Everyone who has played football knows he has slipped. He doesn't catch him with the ball that goes high. The referee who is live does not think it is a red card. I need to see the process."It is like the free-kick for the foul on Evanilson by Casemiro in the first half. He doesn't want to catch him as he looking at the ball but these things happen in football. I don't think these situations are red cards. "We will appeal but it doesn't matter. It is two points that at this moment of the season. We now have to find points against some very difficult teams."1119Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharing'Very important not to lose'published at 16:42 British Summer Time 27 April16:42 BST 27 AprilFT: Bournemouth 1-1 Man UtdManchester UnitedManchester United captain Bruno
Fernandes, speaking to Sky Sports: “It was very important not to lose the game
today. We’re not at the best level in the Premier League, so we needed to get
something. It’s not the result we wanted, but we had to push a
little to get something.“We did enough to at least score
one goal. We created enough chances to score more than one goal, but it’s still
not enough from us.“We need to be have more anger
than the defenders to get the ball. To get [the ball] first, you need to be focused
in everything you do in training. That’s what we have to do from now on. We
should have done it already and we’ve been doing it in training, but you need
to do it in games.“Sometimes you get one chance
and you score a goal, and sometimes you get 10 or 15 chances and don’t score.
With the team we have, we need to get more bodies in the box, create more
danger, be more active in the box, and outside the box be much more brave to
take our chances.”On Rasmus Hojlund: “He knows how
much he needs to score goals at this club. If you want to be at a big club like
Manchester United, you need to improve every time you step onto the pitch, but
it’s not only up to him.“Expectations on him are very
high, and he has to deal with that. When he doesn’t score, he has to focus on
what he needs to do a little bit differently to score.”On parallels between Athletic Club and Bournemouth: “Both
teams are very intense with very quick wingers who are very good in one-v-ones.
We have time now to try and focus on what Athletic are going to do, but we have
to focus on what we’re going to do.”4815Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharing'We deserved at least one point'published at 16:33 British Summer Time 27 April16:33 BST 27 AprilFT: Bournemouth 1-1 Man UtdManchester UnitedManchester United manager Ruben
Amorim, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: “I think [we deserved it]. In the
first half we suffered with their high-intensity press, but we created chances.“We had quite similar chances
near the box with a lot of shots. I think we deserved at least one point if you
look at the game.“If you look at our last games,
it’s always like this – we do something to help the opponent get an advantage.
Then it’s really hard to score goals, but the players did really well to get at
least one point.“We have the ability to push our
opponents. There are small things I think we can do better. We need to
understand these moments better, but if you look at the 20 minutes [after
Evanilson’s red card], we had situations to score, which is really important.”On Rasmus Hojlund: “I will not say [he is] relaxed, but he
could be a little bit lighter during the week. He now needs to score many more.”On Luke Shaw's first league start since last year: “It’s really important. Of
course we need to be careful with his availability. [After the red card], he
was the guy to overload that side. He has quality in the last third, he has a
good pass.”On boosting morale ahead of Thursday's Europa League semi-final first leg: “We’ve
lost two points. We didn’t win, but it doesn’t matter – it’s a different
competition.”8163Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharing'The repercussions for us are huge'published at 16:28 British Summer Time 27 April16:28 BST 27 AprilFT: Bournemouth 1-1 Man UtdBournemouthBournemouth boss Andoni Iraola to Sky Sports: "It is very frustrating, This win would have meant a lot to us. A point is a big difference."On the red card: "Common sense. Everyone who has played football understands. He slips. He doesn't catch him with the leg that goes high and the consequence is a red card. It is another three games without playing. The repercussions for us are huge."Of course we are going to appeal. It is common sense. In the first half Evanilson gets a kick in the chest by Casemiro. I don't think you should have a red card for this. But the VAR cuts the worst angle, the worst frame."On suggestions the VAR did not tell the referee that Evanilson slipped: "If you are telling me that then it is something very, very serious. It is difficult for us."On race for Europe: "We are in a worse position than the start of the weekend but we still have four games to play. Difficult games but we are in the fight."It is difficult to look in a positive way at the moment. We need a few hours."5944Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharing'A dagger to concede at the end'published at 16:22 British Summer Time 27 April16:22 BST 27 AprilFT: Bournemouth 1-1 Man UtdBournemouthImage source, Getty ImagesBournemouth midfielder Alex
Scott, speaking to PLP: “We worked so hard throughout the whole game. We played
really well, especially in the first half. It’s obviously unfortunate with the
red card.“Then you’ve got to dig in. It's
tough against a Manchester United team who haven’t had the best of seasons, but
they’re still Man United. It’s a bit of a dagger to concede the goal at the end.“We gave everything in that
game. We maybe didn’t create enough chances, which is something we’ve lacked a
bit recently. To concede after nine minutes were added on – I don’t know where
nine minutes came from – you’ve got to take it on the chin.”Evanilson’s red card: “I could
see on the pitch that he slipped. It looked like the ref didn’t want to give
[the red card], but once he went to the screen we knew he was more likely to give it.”On Bournemouth’s European hopes:
“The results yesterday didn’t help. We knew we had to come here and get three
points, but we’ll take the one. We’ve played well all season, it’d be a shame
to let it slip in our remaining games.”4740Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharing'We must do better'published at 16:18 British Summer Time 27 April16:18 BST 27 AprilFT: Bournemouth 1-1 Man UtdManchester UnitedManchester United boss Ruben Amorim to Sky Sports: "Was one point. We could do better, We created chances but we need to do better near the box."It is small things. We have to understand the foot that is in play, crossing, one v ones. We need to understand the game in that way."Today we pushed our opponent, especially after the sending off. We had the chances but again we didn't score."On Rasmus Hojlund: "It is always important for strikers to score. But when we look at the game as a striker it is not just the goals. It is a good boost but the next game is a new history and we have to go again."On the next game with Bilbao: "The way Bournemouth defend is quite similar to we can take things from this game. But again it is a new history and we must do better."On Evanilson's red card: "I never comment on red cards, win, lose or draw".16274Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharing'It feels like a loss'published at 16:13 British Summer Time 27 April16:13 BST 27 AprilFT: Bournemouth 1-1 Man UtdBournemouthImage source, Getty ImagesBournemouth winger Antoine Semenyo, speaking to Sky Sports: “It’s
frustrating. We dominated most of the game. We went down to 10 men but I felt we were still quite comfortable. We defended so well. The goal we conceded is so frustrating. It feels a loss, to be honest.”“I feel like there wasn’t much more we could do. All we could do was defend as a group and hope not to concede. We’re just unfortunate to concede with the last shot they had.“The teams above us can lose next week and we can go above them. We just have to go on to next week. We have a tough game [against Arsenal], but the boys will be confident enough going to the Emirates.“It’s not getting easier, but I have full belief in the team that we can do something.”Evanilson’s red card: “Everyone’s just frustrated.
There were challenges [like Evanilson’s] all game. It doesn’t make sense as to why that one
was a red card.”184139Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingPostpublished at 16:09 British Summer Time 27 April16:09 BST 27 AprilFT: Bournemouth 1-1 Man UtdThe draw means Bournemouth stay in 10th, one point behind Fulham and Brighton immediately above them.Manchester United move up one place to 14th.Their focus will now switch to Thursday's Europa League trip to Bilbao.20679Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingPostpublished at 16:04 British Summer Time 27 April16:04 BST 27 AprilFT: Bournemouth 1-1 Man UtdManchester United attempted 25 shots in this game, their highest total in a single match in the Premier League this season.526173Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharing'The red card had a massive impact'published at 16:03 British Summer Time 27 April16:03 BST 27 AprilFT: Bournemouth 1-1 Man UtdJamie RedknappFormer Tottenham midfielder on Sky SportsOn Evanilson's red card...It did change the game.

The Cherries matchday income in their recently published accounts to 30 June 2024 was £6.53m compared to United's £137.13m over the same period.Evidently, Bournemouth have put their spending to better use.At the back, Dean Huijsen and Milos Kerkez excelled as usual, and Alex Scott kept them ticking over in midfield. Crucially, unlike their opponents, they were equally effective at either end of the pitch.Kepa's stunning reaction save to deny Alejandro Garnacho an equaliser, after the Argentina international had raced clear on to Bruno Fernandes' cross-field pass was sensational. But so too was the clinical nature of Semenyo's finish as the visitors failed to clear after Patrick Dorgu had initially been ambushed close to the touchline when United tried to play out from the back and the ball was whipped into the penalty area.It wasn't quite plain sailing for Bournemouth after that but with a historic first European campaign at stake, they seemed to have the grit and determination to keep United out even when they were left a man down.Sadly for them, Hojlund had other ideas.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Red card decision is 'frustrating' - IraolaPoint gained but more problems for Man UtdThe resilience Amorim's side showed to keep going and claim their point will offer some solace before such a big fortnight for the United head coach.Hojlund has now scored two in eight games which, if not quite free scoring, should at least provide some confidence before the Bilbao games when goals, from anywhere, will be so precious.Teenager Chido Obi is still to score and though he was denied late on by Kepa, it is asking too much for a 17-year-old to lead an attack at his level, meaning Hojlund has a massive role to play.But overall, it was another of those occasions when Amorim's team looked less than the sum of their parts.On paper, his starting line-up, containing 10 full internationals, was a good one. Initially, there was some intricate play through midfield and while it did not lead to a major threat on the home goal, it promised more to come.Instead, as has been the case so often, United gave up a goal to their opponents far too easily with Shaw - who completed the full 90 minutes on his first start of the campaign - giving a short pass to Dorgu, who had nowhere to go by the touchline, rather than electing to open the game out either in front of him or to the right.It is that kind of basic decision-making under pressure that continues to undermine Amorim's tactical revolution - and cannot happen again in Spain this week when it really counts.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Man Utd deserved late draw at Bournemouth - AmorimPremier League: Bournemouth under way against struggling Man UtdThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.
