Akins had pulled out into the path of Mr Daniel, who had been cycling home from work.In a victim impact statement, Mr Daniel's wife, Savanna, said his death had been "like hell and a nightmare I'm not waking up from".She criticised Akins for not pleading guilty at the first opportunity, but said she did not want him to go to jail."We do not need any more lives to be destroyed by this," she said.Akins was a Mansfield player when the crash happened and he continued to play for the Nottinghamshire club afterwards. After pleading guilty at Leeds Crown Court on 4 March he started a league match just hours later.He made a further eight appearances for the club - and even started in an international match for Grenada against Russia in Moscow last month - before he was sentenced last week.Akins has played professionally for 18 years and counts Huddersfield, Burton, Tranmere and Stevenage as well as Scottish sides Hamilton Academical and Partick Thistle among his former clubs.He has just two months of his Mansfield contract remaining, having signed a new one-year deal after helping them win promotion from League Two last season.Akins' future beyond the summer remains uncertain."That will be discussed," said Clough. "Nothing will be decided immediately. Everybody is just digesting what was an unbelievable shock this week. "There is talk of him maybe appealing, so we we will see what happens in the next week or two."Related topicsLeague OneFootballMansfield TownTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8726 viewing8.7k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published13 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
