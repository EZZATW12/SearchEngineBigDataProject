"It's something that I've always dreamt of achieving - winning on the biggest stage."After my time off it was the thing that I wanted to really prove to myself and prove to everyone, to show what a player I am."My caddie, through that time, has been my rock. And my wife and my whole team - I wouldn't be where I am without them."Victory meant Penge finished third on the DP World Tour's Asian Swing standings so he also earned a spot at the US PGA Championship at Quail Hollow.Japan's Keita Nakajima, who finished in a tie for 11th on Sunday, was top of the standings ahead of Spain's Eugenio Chacarra, so both will also be heading to the year's second major next month.Related topicsGolfMore on this story'My body was shaking' - a five-foot putt to keep alive Tour hopesPublished28 October 2024Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8892 viewing8.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
