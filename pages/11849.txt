Sarmiento added a fourth moments after coming off the bench, Brownhill and Flemming again involved, as the Ecuadorian's shot deflected beyond Nardi.Trafford got down to well to save Colback's goalbound effort as Burnley fought to preserve their clean sheet.Nathan Redmond came off the bench for just his third appearance of the season to set up Sarmiento for his second - and Burnley's fifth - in added time.Burnley boss Scott Parker told BBC Radio Lancashire:"It was a classy performance - I thought we were excellent."Everything we prepped for the game, the boys nailed it to a tee. We were pretty ruthless and I asked for that."It's been a busy week, full of excitement and joy and a bit of relief as well."We needed to switch that mindset and become this ruthless animal that we've been for large parts this year - we were superb."QPR head coach Marti Cifuentes [on speculation over his future]:"I said before that as long as I'm wanted, I'm very happy."The way the fans have been supporting me, it makes me feel that I want to give them something back even more than the last two seasons."In any case I am very calm about the job I have done and the fact that we have achieved what were difficult targets."I'm an ambitious person in the sense that I always push myself. I always want to improve. I have a contract and I want to keep improving. I enjoy my job here, enjoy English football, and am ready for more."I've said that the support from the fans that I've got this season, in very difficult moments, is something that I have never seen before and will stay with me forever."That's why I'm very sad today. Today hurts. It doesn't define what this team has done this season and it's very sad to finish that way."Related topicsFootballComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 403Championship Scores & FixturesSaturday 26th AprilLuton Town 1 , Coventry City 0 at Full timeLutonLuton TownLuton Town10CoventryCoventry CityCoventry CityFull timeFTQueens Park Rangers 0 , Burnley 5 at Full timeQPRQueens Park RangersQueens Park Rangers05BurnleyBurnleyBurnleyFull timeFTBlackburn Rovers 2 , Watford 1 at Full timeBlackburnBlackburn RoversBlackburn Rovers21WatfordWatfordWatfordFull timeFTCardiff City 0 , West Bromwich Albion 0 at Full timeCardiffCardiff CityCardiff City00West BromWest Bromwich AlbionWest Bromwich AlbionFull timeFTHull City 0 , Derby County 1 at Full timeHullHull CityHull City01DerbyDerby CountyDerby CountyFull timeFTMiddlesbrough 0 , Norwich City 0 at Full timeMiddlesbroughMiddlesbroughMiddlesbrough00NorwichNorwich CityNorwich CityFull timeFTMillwall 1 , Swansea City 0 at Full timeMillwallMillwallMillwall10SwanseaSwansea CitySwansea CityFull timeFTOxford United 2 , Sunderland 0 at Full timeOxfordOxford UnitedOxford United20SunderlandSunderlandSunderlandFull timeFTPreston North End 1 , Plymouth Argyle 2 at Full timePrestonPreston North EndPreston North End12PlymouthPlymouth ArgylePlymouth ArgyleFull timeFTSheffield Wednesday 1 , Portsmouth 1 at Full timeSheff WedSheffield WednesdaySheffield Wednesday11PortsmouthPortsmouthPortsmouthFull timeFTView all Championship fixturesChampionship TableOn Saturday 26th AprilSkip to table keyMatch Participants:Burnley, Position 1, Points 97Queens Park Rangers, Position 15, Points 53TeamPlayedWonDrawnLostGoals ForGoals AgainstGoal DifferencePointsForm, Last 6 games, Oldest first1Burnley452716266155197WResult WinDResult DrawWResult WinWResult WinWResult WinWResult Win2Leeds United442713489296094DResult DrawDResult DrawWResult WinWResult WinWResult WinWResult Win3Sheffield United452871062352789LResult LossLResult LossLResult LossWResult WinLResult LossWResult Win4Sunderland4521131158431576WResult WinDResult DrawLResult LossLResult LossLResult LossLResult Loss5Bristol City441716115749867LResult LossWResult WinWResult WinDResult DrawWResult WinLResult Loss6Coventry City45199176258466LResult LossWResult WinDResult DrawWResult WinLResult LossLResult Loss7Millwall451812154646066WResult WinWResult WinWResult WinLResult LossWResult WinWResult Win8Blackburn Rovers45198185247565LResult LossDResult DrawWResult WinWResult WinWResult WinWResult Win9Middlesbrough4518101764541064WResult WinLResult LossLResult LossWResult WinLResult LossDResult Draw10West Bromwich Albion451419125244861LResult LossLResult LossWResult WinLResult LossLResult LossDResult Draw11Swansea City45179194853-560WResult WinWResult WinWResult WinWResult WinWResult WinLResult Loss12Sheffield Wednesday451512185968-957LResult LossDResult DrawLResult LossLResult LossWResult WinDResult Draw13Watford45168215260-856LResult LossWResult WinLResult LossLResult LossLResult LossLResult Loss14Norwich City451315176766154LResult LossDResult DrawLResult LossLResult LossLResult LossDResult Draw15Queens Park Rangers451314185263-1153DResult DrawWResult WinDResult DrawWResult WinLResult LossLResult Loss16Portsmouth451411205770-1353LResult LossLResult LossDResult DrawWResult WinWResult WinDResult Draw17Oxford United451313194662-1652WResult WinLResult LossWResult WinLResult LossDResult DrawWResult Win18Stoke City451214194562-1750DResult DrawDResult DrawWResult WinWResult WinLResult LossLResult Loss19Derby County451310224856-849LResult LossDResult DrawDResult DrawLResult LossWResult WinWResult Win20Preston North End451019164657-1149DResult DrawDResult DrawLResult LossLResult LossLResult LossLResult Loss21Luton Town451310224264-2249DResult DrawDResult DrawLResult LossWResult WinWResult WinWResult Win22Hull City451212214353-1048WResult WinLResult LossDResult DrawLResult LossWResult WinLResult Loss23Plymouth Argyle451113215086-3646WResult WinLResult LossWResult WinLResult LossWResult WinWResult Win24Cardiff City45917194669-2344DResult DrawDResult DrawLResult LossLResult LossDResult DrawDResult DrawView latest Championship tableKeyPosition 1 - 2 : PromotionPosition 3 - 6 : Promotion Play-offPosition 22 - 24 : RelegationSheffield United have been deducted two points for defaulted transfer payments.Last Updated 26th April 2025 at 17:01Please Note: All times UK.
