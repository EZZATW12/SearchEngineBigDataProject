"What a finish. That finish is exceptional."Palace boss Oliver Glasner had clearly seen it all before, as he said: "They are always finishing from the edge of the box in training."The first goal was about winning the ball. As he has showed many times in training, a great finish by Eze."'Magnificent strike' from Sarr doubles Palace leadThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Sarr long-range strike doubles Palace leadJean-Philippe Mateta had a wonderful chance to put the Eagles 2-0 up from the spot in the second half, but his penalty clipped the outside of the post and went wide.Sarr, however, made sure the miss would not prove costly.After Adam Wharton won possession back in midfield, the ball broke to the Senegal international and he arrowed a brilliant long-range strike into the bottom left corner."Ismaila Sarr played his role in the first half with the assist," said Shearer on commentary. "The closing down from Adam Wharton, fantastic, then the invitation arrives for Ismaila Sarr to have a shot at goal."That is a magnificent strike and a great goal. Nothing more than they deserve."Sarr caps fine win - but Glasner leaves dancing to his playersThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Sarr seals win with goal in stoppage timeWith Villa in search of a late goal to keep the contest alive, they were again outdone by Palace's excellent pressing.This time it was substitute Eddie Nketiah who won the ball back for the Eagles, before releasing Sarr to produce a ruthless finish past Martinez."Aston Villa were caught on the ball because of the pressure that Palace have put them under," said Shearer.The final whistle which followed soon after was met by a cacophony of noise and wild celebrations from the Palace fans.Glasner was asked afterwards to describe the scenes in the Eagles dressing room at full-time and the Austrian mentioned there was a lot of dancing among the players."Did I dance? No," he said. "This is a great moment but when I start dancing I destroy this moment, so it's probably best I don't dance."So, should Wembley be used for FA Cup semi-finals?If goals and moments like these can be guaranteed, who - besides Villa fans, perhaps - would dream of moving them anywhere else?Related topicsPremier LeagueFA CupCrystal PalaceFootball'Glasner's FA Cup heroes give Tuchel food for thought'Published1 day agoCrystal Palace thump Aston Villa to reach FA Cup finalMore on this storyLatest Crystal Palace news, analysis and fan viewsGet Crystal Palace news sent straight to your phonePublished26 July 2022Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8215 viewing8.2k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished3 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
