"We are disappointed we didn't win the game, with the number of chances we had and we score two very good goals as well," he tells BBC Scotland. "That perhaps shows how far we've come."We played some terrific football as well.

One moment of quality from Danny Armstrong puts in a great ball into the box, and they score from it, and that was the difference. "In these games, that's really important, getting that first goal, then allows Kilmarnock to play with that bit of confidence, bit of freedom."So, really disappointed because we spoke all week about how important it was to try and get that first goal. "We won't hide away from it. We're disappointed with the run of form that we're in. So we know where we are. We've got four games left, it's a case of not feeling sorry for ourselves.  "It'll hurt right now. Long journey up the road, a lot of time to reflect on the game, which I'll do, and then it's making sure that on Monday that we are ready for a massive game against Hearts. "We're at home, we've got to be ready for it, and it's still in our hands."Image source, SNS62Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingMcInnes hails 'efficient and professional' winpublished at 17:49 British Summer Time 26 April17:49 BST 26 AprilFT: Kilmarnock 2-0 Ross CountyKilmarnock manager Derek McInnes tells BBC Scotland his side put in a much-needed "efficient and professional" performance as they eased past Ross County.“Who knows [how important the win will be]," he said. "But it was just important for us to bounce back after our disappointment at Celtic Park. It was a tough afternoon, you’re never truly judged on those games, but we are judged on these.“In the last two games, Motherwell and Ross County, [we were] quite similar, we weren't enthralling or too exciting it but it was efficient, professional, and got the job done with two cleansheets and 2-0 [in both games].“The first goal is a great goal with a lovely stood-up cross from Danny Armstrong and Bruce Anderson finding space amongst all the size. He’s the smallest player in the box, and he finds that space, which he’s always done. A great goal.“In the second half, we wanted to keep that momentum going. We were pretty steady with our work. The second goal comes from Liam Donnelly, I thought he was our best player today - a real responsibility and presence in the middle of the park and lovely quality for the second goal.”Image source, SNSImage caption, Kilmarnock goalscorers Liam Donnelly (left) and Bruce Anderson52Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingHibs still have 'brilliant opportunity' - Graypublished at 17:45 British Summer Time 26 April17:45 BST 26 AprilFT: Aberdeen 1-0 HibernianHibernian head coach David Gray: "It's obviously a feeling we've not had for a very long time. It's never nice when it comes around. I certainly don't enjoy the feeling, none of the players do."Did we do enough to win it? Probably not. But the players gave me everything. Kevin Nisbet scored a fantastic goal that separated the two sides. We created enough chances without being clinical within that."It certainly makes it tighter. We're still sitting in third position with four games to go. We've given ourselves a brilliant opportunity. It is about the reaction now, you can't dwell on this result, this performance.

Yes, the result was not what we were hoping but next home match we don't have any other choice than to win."When you change your backline you lose the connection between the players. "The only medicine for this is to win the next game."We need some other results to go our way now too.

It's been a tough two weeks, we let our standards drop against Hibs."Hearts have got excellent players, and they kept changing and trying to find the answers. But we limited them and as the game went on, they crossed from deeper and we became more comfortable."We've faced a lot of adversity through injuries, Joe Shaughnessy has missed 31 games for me this season.

They weren't brilliant by any means but impressed in the way that once ahead, it was them who showed the desire to finish the job.That's crucial in these pressure games and stands them in good stead for the run-in, with a trip to beleaguered St Johnstone next.For Ross County, they will be desperate to avoid another play-off finish. There's only so many times you can dance with the devil before you get burned. Five defeats on the trot is not the sort of form you want at this stage of  the season.

Ferguson told BBC Sport Scotland. "That's the thing that frustrates me."The issue I've got is people don't fear playing Rangers now. Whether that's at home or away, they enjoy coming to Ibrox."And then, when you go away from home, teams look to see if they can bully you, run hard at you and get in about you."Ferguson had been hoping to impress enough to secure the job on a permanent basis but has won just four of his 11 games in charge.Errors by centre-back John Souttar and goalkeeper Liam Kelly presented St Mirren captain O'Hara and Mikael Mandron with early opportunities to open the scoring, while Dessers blasted wildly over at the other end.Dessers made amends when Rangers took the lead with their first flowing move, the striker collecting Raskin's low pass, turning his marker and firing low past goalkeeper Zach Hemming.However, when a long throw-in deflected into O'Hara's path, the midfielder swept it home from 15 yards.Rangers were back in the lead after the break when Raskin gathered Diomande's pass and poked a low drive past Hemming from the edge of the penalty box.St Mirren should have been back level when Souttar again dallied on the ball, Phillips' backheel put Roland Idowu in the clear, but his shot came off Kelly's legs.The equaliser eventually came when Declan John's low cross was turned into the net by the sliding McMenamin.St Mirren defy budgets againThat St Mirren went into this game looking to defeat Rangers three times in a single league campaign for the first time since 1979-80 was an indication of how well Stephen Robinson's side have done this season.They had won their last two home league games, scoring eight goals in the process, with a 3-2 win over Ross County overtaking Hearts to secure a top-six finish.However, top scorer Toyosi Olusanya has since been sold to Houston Dynamo and, handed the chance to prove himself a worthy replacement, Mandron failed to make his mark.This St Mirren are a team built on team-work, however, and others stood up when it counted to secure another impressive point.Another blow to Ferguson's hopesRangers' away form has been a bright spot amid some gloomy moments this season, but they were unable to make it seven Premiership wins on the road.Ferguson looked increasingly frustrated on the sidelines as their inability to dominate lesser equipped opponents was again on full display.Perhaps conscious of the tight pitch, Ferguson had dropped in-form Vaclav Cerny and Ianis Hagi to the bench, but the result was a disjoined and error-strewn display.A team that went toe-to-toe with Athletic Bilbao in the Europa League played like strangers and were in danger of losing back-to-back league visits to Paisley for the first time since April 1986. Celtic's emphatic win at Dundee United earlier in the day was yet another example of the gap between the sides - now 17 points - and the draw in Paisley does little for Ferguson's hopes of staying team boss beyond the end of the season.It was further proof that whoever does get the job has a major task on their hands next season.What they saidSt Mirren manager Stephen Robinson: "We are disappointed we didn't win with the number of chances we had. That perhaps shows how far we've come."We played some terrific football. If you look at the disparity of the resources of the two clubs, there weren't many people who could have told the difference today."Rangers interim head coach Barry Ferguson: "Not good enough. I know it is a difficult place to come, but when you take the lead twice, you need to maintain that."That's been a problem all season and that's the reason we've not been challenging. You can do as much work on the training ground and say as many things in meetings, but sloppy goals have been our Achilles heel, not just since I've come in."Related topicsSt MirrenScottish PremiershipRangersFootballScottish Premiership Scores & FixturesSaturday 26th AprilHearts 0 , Dundee 1 at Full timeHeartsHeartsHearts01DundeeDundeeDundeeFull timeFTKilmarnock 2 , Ross County 0 at Full timeKilmarnockKilmarnockKilmarnock20Ross CountyRoss CountyRoss CountyFull timeFTMotherwell 3 , St. Johnstone 2 at Full timeMotherwellMotherwellMotherwell32St. JohnstoneSt. JohnstoneSt. JohnstoneFull timeFTDundee United 0 , Celtic 5 at Full timeDundee UtdDundee UnitedDundee United05CelticCelticCelticFull timeFTAberdeen 1 , Hibernian 0 at Full timeAberdeenAberdeenAberdeen10HibernianHibernianHibernianFull timeFTSt. Mirren 2 , Rangers 2 at Full timeSt. MirrenSt. MirrenSt. Mirren22RangersRangersRangersFull timeFTView all Scottish Premiership fixturesScottish Premiership TableOn Saturday 26th AprilSkip to table keyMatch Participants:Rangers, Position 2, Points 67St. Mirren, Position 6, Points 422nd Phase Championship GroupTeamPlayedWonDrawnLostGoals ForGoals AgainstGoal DifferencePointsForm, Last 6 games, Oldest first1Celtic342734102228084No ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultWResult Win2Rangers34207770373367No ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultDResult Draw3Hibernian341411954421253No ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultLResult Loss4Aberdeen34158114649-353No ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultWResult Win5Dundee United34148124145-450No ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultLResult Loss6St. Mirren34126164756-942No ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultDResult DrawView latest Scottish Premiership table2nd Phase Relegation GroupTeamPlayedWonDrawnLostGoals ForGoals AgainstGoal DifferencePointsForm, Last 6 games, Oldest first1Motherwell34126164058-1842No ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultWResult Win2Hearts34117164345-240No ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultLResult Loss3Kilmarnock34108164058-1838No ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultWResult Win4Dundee34107175171-2037No ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultWResult Win5Ross County3498173358-2535No ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultLResult Loss6St. Johnstone3485213561-2629No ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultLResult LossView latest Scottish Premiership tableMatch Participants:Rangers, Position 2, Points 66St. Mirren, Position 6, Points 41TeamPlayedWonDrawnLostGoals ForGoals AgainstGoal DifferencePointsForm, Last 6 games, Oldest first1Celtic33263497227581WResult WinWResult WinLResult LossWResult WinLResult LossWResult Win2Rangers33206768353366WResult WinLResult LossWResult WinWResult WinLResult LossDResult Draw3Hibernian331411854411353WResult WinWResult WinDResult DrawWResult WinWResult WinWResult Win4Dundee United33148114140150LResult LossDResult DrawLResult LossWResult WinWResult WinWResult Win5Aberdeen33148114549-450LResult LossDResult DrawDResult DrawWResult WinWResult WinDResult Draw6St. Mirren33125164554-941LResult LossLResult LossDResult DrawWResult WinLResult LossWResult Win7Hearts33117154344-140WResult WinLResult LossWResult WinLResult LossLResult LossDResult Draw8Motherwell33116163756-1939WResult WinWResult WinDResult DrawLResult LossLResult LossDResult Draw9Kilmarnock3398163858-2035LResult LossLResult LossDResult DrawLResult LossWResult WinLResult Loss10Ross County3398163356-2335LResult LossWResult WinLResult LossLResult LossLResult LossLResult Loss11Dundee3397175071-2134LResult LossDResult DrawWResult WinLResult LossWResult WinLResult Loss12St. Johnstone3385203358-2529WResult WinDResult DrawDResult DrawLResult LossWResult WinLResult LossView latest Scottish Premiership tableKeyPosition 1 - 2 : UEFA Champions League QualifiersPosition 3 : UEFA Europa League QualifiersPosition 4 : UEFA Conference League QualifiersLast Updated 26th April 2025 at 18:12Please Note: All times UK.
