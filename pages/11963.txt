"I'm comfortable with [the expectation]. "I believe that I'm the man to get us out of this situation and move the club forward in the future."Having gone four league games without scoring, the Edinburgh side are now eighth, five points above the relegation play-off spot with four games remaining.Critchley's assistant Mike Garrity also departs, with coach Liam Fox taking control on an interim basis.Hapless Hearts beaten at home by DundeeVisit our Hearts page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views'Board panicked but Critchley never right for Hearts'Former Hearts midfielder Michael Stewart on Sportscene"The club have panicked. They are clearly concerned about being dragged into the relegation play-off spot. "I'm not surprised. I've got a great deal of sympathy for Neil Critchley. He's a nice guy and clearly knows a lot about football, but he was never a Hearts manager. "That's a bigger issue for me - who's making these appointments. Critchley was the seventh appointment since Ann Budge took the club out of administration and the track record has not been great."When Neil Critchley's name was mooted, I don't think a single person associated with Hearts thought 'oh, that's a good appointment'. "With this one, the board basically absolved themselves of any responsibility for it and handed the decision over to Jamestown Analytics. You cannot just take a step back and give full responsibility to someone else."Jamestown Analytics was heralded as the tool that could have Hearts challenge for the title but they've not been able to get a manager who could last a season and that undermines it."I don't think it's rocket science. Far too often, it feels like they are trying to be too smart and do things differently rather than just doing football things properly. "Hearts are arguably the third biggest club in the country and should be challenging every season. But they're bottom six and not maximising what they've got."Have your sayWhat do you make of Hearts decision to sack Critchley?And what should the club do now?Let us know hereRelated topicsScottish PremiershipScottish FootballHeart of MidlothianFootballTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9081 viewing9.1k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished4 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Scottish sportWhat is still to be decided as season reaches climax?League reconstruction - why, when & what might it look like?Scotland men's internationals to be shown live on BBCCommonwealth Games: Why is it so special to be part of Team Scotland?From titles to tinpottery - rank Scotland's top 10 clubsElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
