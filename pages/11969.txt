"We are disappointed we didn't win the game, with the number of chances we had and we score two very good goals as well," he tells BBC Scotland. "That perhaps shows how far we've come."We played some terrific football as well. If you look at the disparity of the resources of the two football clubs, there weren't many people who could have told the difference today."Image source, SNS344Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingCounty 'won't hide' after latest defeat - Cowiepublished at 17:52 British Summer Time 26 April17:52 BST 26 AprilFT: KIlmarnock 2-0 Ross CountyRoss County manager Don Cowie tells BBC Scotland: "Overall, probably, yeah [it was a fair result]."I don't think there was much in the first half at all. One moment of quality from Danny Armstrong puts in a great ball into the box, and they score from it, and that was the difference. "In these games, that's really important, getting that first goal, then allows Kilmarnock to play with that bit of confidence, bit of freedom."So, really disappointed because we spoke all week about how important it was to try and get that first goal. "We won't hide away from it. We're disappointed with the run of form that we're in. So we know where we are. We've got four games left, it's a case of not feeling sorry for ourselves.  "It'll hurt right now. Long journey up the road, a lot of time to reflect on the game, which I'll do, and then it's making sure that on Monday that we are ready for a massive game against Hearts. "We're at home, we've got to be ready for it, and it's still in our hands."Image source, SNS62Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingMcInnes hails 'efficient and professional' winpublished at 17:49 British Summer Time 26 April17:49 BST 26 AprilFT: Kilmarnock 2-0 Ross CountyKilmarnock manager Derek McInnes tells BBC Scotland his side put in a much-needed "efficient and professional" performance as they eased past Ross County.“Who knows [how important the win will be]," he said. "But it was just important for us to bounce back after our disappointment at Celtic Park. It was a tough afternoon, you’re never truly judged on those games, but we are judged on these.“In the last two games, Motherwell and Ross County, [we were] quite similar, we weren't enthralling or too exciting it but it was efficient, professional, and got the job done with two cleansheets and 2-0 [in both games].“The first goal is a great goal with a lovely stood-up cross from Danny Armstrong and Bruce Anderson finding space amongst all the size. He’s the smallest player in the box, and he finds that space, which he’s always done. A great goal.“In the second half, we wanted to keep that momentum going. We were pretty steady with our work. The second goal comes from Liam Donnelly, I thought he was our best player today - a real responsibility and presence in the middle of the park and lovely quality for the second goal.”Image source, SNSImage caption, Kilmarnock goalscorers Liam Donnelly (left) and Bruce Anderson52Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingHibs still have 'brilliant opportunity' - Graypublished at 17:45 British Summer Time 26 April17:45 BST 26 AprilFT: Aberdeen 1-0 HibernianHibernian head coach David Gray: "It's obviously a feeling we've not had for a very long time. It's never nice when it comes around. I certainly don't enjoy the feeling, none of the players do."Did we do enough to win it? Probably not. But the players gave me everything. Kevin Nisbet scored a fantastic goal that separated the two sides. We created enough chances without being clinical within that."It certainly makes it tighter. We're still sitting in third position with four games to go. We've given ourselves a brilliant opportunity. It is about the reaction now, you can't dwell on this result, this performance.

It's difficult to win the match when you concede three goals."It's hard to criticise my players though, they put in everything."There was a lot of good performances. Yes, the result was not what we were hoping but next home match we don't have any other choice than to win."When you change your backline you lose the connection between the players. "The only medicine for this is to win the next game."We need some other results to go our way now too. At the same time, we can only do what we can do and we need to start winning football matches."The boys want to do well but unfortunately we get no points.

More important was that we came back from going 1-0 down very well."The game from minute 20 to minute 45 was how I want to see us play, to think forward and to play forward. We stayed calm and we deserved the two goals."We also have to speak about the goals we conceded because it was too easy."I spoke a lot with Tony Watt and told him he has to keep going and he'll get his chance. This was the Tony I want to see.

You saw a team with a real team ethic there."We executed that game plan to the letter and I couldn't be more proud of them, putting in that level of performance. It's been a tough two weeks, we let our standards drop against Hibs."Hearts have got excellent players, and they kept changing and trying to find the answers. But we limited them and as the game went on, they crossed from deeper and we became more comfortable."We've faced a lot of adversity through injuries, Joe Shaughnessy has missed 31 games for me this season.

They weren't brilliant by any means but impressed in the way that once ahead, it was them who showed the desire to finish the job.That's crucial in these pressure games and stands them in good stead for the run-in, with a trip to beleaguered St Johnstone next.For Ross County, they will be desperate to avoid another play-off finish. There's only so many times you can dance with the devil before you get burned. Five defeats on the trot is not the sort of form you want at this stage of  the season.

They now sit two points below Dundee in the play-off position.Every result from now until the season end is going to be vital. And it felt that if either side won this, they could breathe a little, albeit with work to do. Over half an hour in, not one genuine chance had been created and that perhaps spoke of the pressure on both to deliver. Plenty of endeavour but little quality. Goals do indeed change games and did so here. Armstrong had the first decent shot moments before delivering a perfect ball for Anderson to attack and he did so to score a crucial, crucial goal.That lifted the crowd and while Ronan Hale went close from an angle, the visitors just couldn't threaten enough to change the course of the game.McInnes' side seemed determined to determine their own fate and, after a number of second-half chances, broke through when Donnelly showed great intent to juggle the ball and then fire home the vital second.Kilmarnock get it right at great timeFight and scrap are qualities McInnes demanded heading into this. That was there, but the key bit seemed missing until the crucial opening goal.This game marked 150 appearances for Armstrong, in what hasn't been his most productive season, but he delivered a key assist at a key moment to mark that landmark, with Anderson doing very, very well to make it count.The tension was clear around Rugby Park up to then and didn't fully evaporate, but Kilmarnock built on it rather than stepping back, were rewarded and were thus rarely under pressure. Three points deliver a little bit of cushion to ease the pressure, with the chance to take on a now-desperate St Johnstone, who are well adrift at the bottom.McInnes suggested two wins out of five may be enough for safety. If right, they're already halfway there. Matters are now very much in their hands.County coasting in wrong directionA four-game losing run coming into this five-game bottom-six scrap was clearly not ideal. County are used to being in this situation, having been in the play-off two seasons running and survived. But you don't want to dance with the devil too often, and this outcome leaves them in the play-off spot with a lot of work to do.If they are to avoid third time unlucky in terms of overall survival, they'll need to find an effective way to trouble their opponents more consistently.They couldn't pose many problems for Kilmarnock and there's little to be gained from being competitive but not making it count. That's what is happening and at a bad time.In truth, the Dingwall side rarely looked likely to take anything after falling behind and with a bruised Hearts side next at home, they need to quickly arrest this form.What they saidKilmarnock manager Derek McInnes: "We weren't enthralling or exciting but it was efficient, professional, and got the job done. It was just a very efficient performance and exactly what we need at this moment."If you start looking to depend on other people, you don't get the job done. And I think we've got to be responsible, got to take ownership of it and just grab the situation we're in".Ross County manager Don Cowie: "We won't hide away from it. We're disappointed with the run of form that we're in. We know where we are. "We've got four games left, it's a case of not feeling sorry for ourselves. We're at home, we've got to be ready for it, and it's still in our hands. That's the message."Related topicsRoss CountyKilmarnockScottish PremiershipFootballScottish Premiership Scores & FixturesSaturday 26th AprilHearts 0 , Dundee 1 at Full timeHeartsHeartsHearts01DundeeDundeeDundeeFull timeFTKilmarnock 2 , Ross County 0 at Full timeKilmarnockKilmarnockKilmarnock20Ross CountyRoss CountyRoss CountyFull timeFTMotherwell 3 , St. Johnstone 2 at Full timeMotherwellMotherwellMotherwell32St. JohnstoneSt. JohnstoneSt. JohnstoneFull timeFTDundee United 0 , Celtic 5 at Full timeDundee UtdDundee UnitedDundee United05CelticCelticCelticFull timeFTAberdeen 1 , Hibernian 0 at Full timeAberdeenAberdeenAberdeen10HibernianHibernianHibernianFull timeFTSt. Mirren 2 , Rangers 2 at Full timeSt. MirrenSt. MirrenSt. Mirren22RangersRangersRangersFull timeFTView all Scottish Premiership fixturesScottish Premiership TableOn Saturday 26th AprilSkip to table key2nd Phase Championship GroupTeamPlayedWonDrawnLostGoals ForGoals AgainstGoal DifferencePointsForm, Last 6 games, Oldest first1Celtic342734102228084No ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultWResult Win2Rangers34207770373367No ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultDResult Draw3Hibernian341411954421253No ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultLResult Loss4Aberdeen34158114649-353No ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultWResult Win5Dundee United34148124145-450No ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultLResult Loss6St. Mirren34126164756-942No ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultDResult DrawView latest Scottish Premiership tableMatch Participants:Kilmarnock, Position 3, Points 38Ross County, Position 5, Points 352nd Phase Relegation GroupTeamPlayedWonDrawnLostGoals ForGoals AgainstGoal DifferencePointsForm, Last 6 games, Oldest first1Motherwell34126164058-1842No ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultWResult Win2Hearts34117164345-240No ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultLResult Loss3Kilmarnock34108164058-1838No ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultWResult Win4Dundee34107175171-2037No ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultWResult Win5Ross County3498173358-2535No ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultLResult Loss6St. Johnstone3485213561-2629No ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultNo ResultLResult LossView latest Scottish Premiership tableMatch Participants:Kilmarnock, Position 9, Points 35Ross County, Position 10, Points 35TeamPlayedWonDrawnLostGoals ForGoals AgainstGoal DifferencePointsForm, Last 6 games, Oldest first1Celtic33263497227581WResult WinWResult WinLResult LossWResult WinLResult LossWResult Win2Rangers33206768353366WResult WinLResult LossWResult WinWResult WinLResult LossDResult Draw3Hibernian331411854411353WResult WinWResult WinDResult DrawWResult WinWResult WinWResult Win4Dundee United33148114140150LResult LossDResult DrawLResult LossWResult WinWResult WinWResult Win5Aberdeen33148114549-450LResult LossDResult DrawDResult DrawWResult WinWResult WinDResult Draw6St. Mirren33125164554-941LResult LossLResult LossDResult DrawWResult WinLResult LossWResult Win7Hearts33117154344-140WResult WinLResult LossWResult WinLResult LossLResult LossDResult Draw8Motherwell33116163756-1939WResult WinWResult WinDResult DrawLResult LossLResult LossDResult Draw9Kilmarnock3398163858-2035LResult LossLResult LossDResult DrawLResult LossWResult WinLResult Loss10Ross County3398163356-2335LResult LossWResult WinLResult LossLResult LossLResult LossLResult Loss11Dundee3397175071-2134LResult LossDResult DrawWResult WinLResult LossWResult WinLResult Loss12St. Johnstone3385203358-2529WResult WinDResult DrawDResult DrawLResult LossWResult WinLResult LossView latest Scottish Premiership tableKeyPosition 1 - 2 : UEFA Champions League QualifiersPosition 3 : UEFA Europa League QualifiersPosition 4 : UEFA Conference League QualifiersLast Updated 26th April 2025 at 18:12Please Note: All times UK.

Indeed, a league-high 74% of their points in the Scottish Premiership this season have come at home (26/35).Ross County have lost each of their last four league games – the longest ongoing losing run in the Scottish Premiership this season. The Staggies last lost more in a row in August 2022 (6), and last did so within a single season in December 2020 (6).Ronan Hale has scored nine Scottish Premiership goals this season, and could become only the sixth player to score 10+ in a top-flight campaign for Ross County, after Liam Boyce (3 times), Alex Schalk (2017-18), Regan Charles-Cook (2021-22), Jordan White (2022-23), and Simon Murray (2023-24).HomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright © 2025 BBC.
