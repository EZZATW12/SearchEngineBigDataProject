Canada, India, Nigeria, plus two others have all publicly confirmed their interest in the centenary Games in 2030, while New Zealand are one of two nations looking at the 2034 edition.In January, the 74 Commonwealth nations were invited to lodge notes of interest and the seven who responded positively - all from Africa, Asia, the Americas, and Oceania - will have the feasiblity of their bids examined over the next five months.It is expected that the hosts of the 2030 Games will be finalised in November.Commonwealth Sport chief executive Katie Sadleir said: "We are thrilled with the incredible interest from four of our six regions."We cannot understate the hugely-significant role Scotland has played, having the foresight, tenacity and innovative thinking to step forward and host in 2026. "We are confident that Glasgow's pioneering example will increase the breadth of countries able to host the Games in the decades ahead."Phil Batty, chief executive of Glasgow 2026, said the news shows that next summer's Games will be "a pivotal moment" in the event's history."I have every confidence Glasgow 2026 will pioneer a new model for the major event - one that delivers a successful Games on time, on budget and with high-quality sport at the heart of the experience," he added.Related topicsCommonwealth GamesMore on this storyMile races will be among more than 200 Glasgow 2026 goldsPublished6 FebruaryWill Glasgow be last leg or clever rebirth for Commonwealths?Published17 September 2024Scotland agrees to host Commonwealth Games in 2026 Published17 September 2024Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9063 viewing9.1k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished5 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Scottish sportWhat is still to be decided as season reaches climax?League reconstruction - why, when & what might it look like?Scotland men's internationals to be shown live on BBCCommonwealth Games: Why is it so special to be part of Team Scotland?From titles to tinpottery - rank Scotland's top 10 clubsElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
