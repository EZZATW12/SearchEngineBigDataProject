I had never been on a fixed-gear bike, I had never had clip-in pedals, never been inside a velodrome. So I am part of the legacy of the 2014 Commonwealth Games. "To go back and race it 12 years later, it would be absolutely incredible to come away with a gold medal. I know it is going to be difficult, the track events are very hotly contested, but it is a major target for me next season."Hitting the road is 'no-lose situation'This year, however, the Aberdeenshire racer will concentrate on the road to "move out of her comfort zone a little bit".Riding for the Handsling Alba Development Team, Evans - the daughter of Ros, who represented Team GB at the 1984 Winter Olympics at cross-country skiing - hopes to scratch what she admits is a competitive itch.Evans explains that British Cycling tends to focus on developing younger riders after an Olympic cycle, so she will not get the same number of opportunities on the track."So it made perfect sense to challenge myself and really focus on the road, which I have never actually done," she added."Although I have done a few road races over the years, it has never been a target, it has never been what I have trained for and there has always been this unknown of 'what could I do?' because I picked up one or two results along the way."I do believe there is potential to be successful. It is quite a big ask, but it is nice to have a different challenge, it is going to keep things fresh."It's a bit of a no-lose situation because I do have the spot with British Cycling. If it doesn't succeed then it has been a fun year and I go back to the track. "If it does work wonderfully well then I will have a rethink and decide how I am going to juggle road racing and track racing."Related topicsCommonwealth GamesCyclingTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9063 viewing9.1k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished5 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Scottish sportWhat is still to be decided as season reaches climax?League reconstruction - why, when & what might it look like?Scotland men's internationals to be shown live on BBCCommonwealth Games: Why is it so special to be part of Team Scotland?From titles to tinpottery - rank Scotland's top 10 clubsElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
