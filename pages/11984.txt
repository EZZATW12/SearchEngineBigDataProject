That is double the amount on offer three years ago.And 56 will be on offer at Tollcross International Swimming Centre, with the men's 800m and women's 1500m freestyle races included for the first time.Omitting the 1500m - in which Scotland's Josh Kerr and Laura Muir are Olympic medallists - is a surprise move.It has been replaced by an event last run in 1966.Organisers say the Commonwealth Mile - the equivalent of 1609m - is a tribute to 'The Miracle Mile' run at the 1954 staging in Vancouver.On that occasion, England's Roger Bannister and Australian John Landy competed two months after the former became the first athlete to run a sub-four-minute mile."The mile is the quintessential Commonwealth athletics event whose return I very much welcome," said World Athletics President Sebastian Coe, who suggested the event to Glasgow organisers."From 1930 through to 1966, the mile was the blue-riband event of each Games and the magic of the mile continues to resonate."A ticket to watch its Commonwealth final will be one of the must-have seats in Glasgow next year."Related topicsCommonwealth GamesTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9063 viewing9.1k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished5 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Scottish sportWhat is still to be decided as season reaches climax?League reconstruction - why, when & what might it look like?Scotland men's internationals to be shown live on BBCCommonwealth Games: Why is it so special to be part of Team Scotland?From titles to tinpottery - rank Scotland's top 10 clubsElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
