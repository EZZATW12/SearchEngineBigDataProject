Cardiff's goal difference is not good."It's two cups finals to keep Cardiff City in the league. Listen, it's going to be two of the biggest games for Cardiff City ever because you don't want to drop down to League One."Cardiff are in need an upturn in form to give themselves of hope of survival having claimed only one victory in their past 10 league games.They have won successive matches on only one occasion this season, when they saw off Plymouth and Portsmouth at the Cardiff City Stadium in October.The Welsh club have not played in the third tier of English football since 2003 – but Earnshaw fears they may be stuck there for a while if they do go down."You look at the likes of Portsmouth, Bolton, all of these teams who have been down there for years, teams that were in the Premier League finding it very difficult to come back [up from League One]," he added."To be honest it doesn't look good for Cardiff City. I am worried. But I have hope and I am going to be cheering on Cardiff City and Aaron Ramsey."Pick of the stats: Cardiff City v West Bromwich Albionpublished at 10:19 25 April10:19 25 AprilHaving both sacked their managers over Easter Weekend, Cardiff City and West Bromwich Albion will meet on Saturday (15:00 BST) with ambitions of staying alive on either side of the table.The Bluebirds will be under the charge of Wales captain Aaron Ramsey after sacking Omar Riza following their defeat to Sheffield United on Friday.The Welshman's first game at the helm culminated in a 1-1 draw with Oxford, keeping them afloat in the relegation fight with three points between them and safety.While former Albion midfielder James Morrison replaces Tony Mowbray, who lost his position after a 3-1 loss to Derby County on Monday, for the first time as the Baggies look to keep their fleeting hopes of the play-offs alive.Cardiff are winless in their last seven league games against West Brom (D4 L3), failing to score in five of these matches.West Brom have won two of their last three away league games against Cardiff (D1), as many as in their previous 11 visits (D6 L3).Cardiff have won just one of their last 10 league games (D4 L5), and are winless in six since beating Blackburn 2-1 in March.West Brom have lost five of their last six league games (W1), as many as they had in their previous 30 (W8 D17).West Brom are winless in their last 14 away league games (D7 L7). It's their longest run since a run of 15 between September 2017 and March 2018, while they've never gone 15 without a win on the road outside the top-flight.08:05 25 AprilEFL Preview: Points win prizes in survival scrap, published at 08:05 25 AprilEFL Preview: Points win prizes in survival scrapAttributionFootballComments94Chambers has 'every belief' in Cardiff survivalpublished at 05:17 25 April05:17 25 AprilImage source, Huw Evans Picture AgencyDefender Calum Chambers has "every belief" that Cardiff City can still retain their Championship status but says they must win their final two games of the season.The Bluebirds are three points from safety with West Bromwich Albion and Norwich City still left to play.A win at home to West Brom would take Cardiff's relegation fight to the final fixture at Carrow Road. A draw will mean they will have to rely on other results to prolong their season, while a defeat will almost certainly see them relegated because of their goal difference."We know what we need to do and what's required," said Chambers."All our focus is on the next game [against West Brom] and it's a must win for us to get three points."As a group, we all know that is the game we need to go and win, so we are all focused on that and that's what we are doing our best to do."I have every belief in this team and squad, the whole season I've been saying the same thing. It's unfortunate the situation we are in, it's down to us now to put it right and go out and win the remaining two games we've got - that's all we can do."Chambers says everyone at the club takes "accountability" for the Bluebirds' predicament but says there is no single reason for the poor campaign."You can't point your finger at one thing," added Chambers."It's a collective, there are things that haven't gone right for us throughout the season, there's not one thing you can say that it's down to - it's a collective of things."Everyone has to take accountability for that. We are all aware of where we are, so no one needs telling in the dressing room or around the club."We are just doing everything we can to get it right."17:02 24 AprilRamsey focused on Cardiff but has World Cup hope, published at 17:02 24 AprilRamsey focused on Cardiff but has World Cup hopeAttributionChampionship'Ramsey should be Cardiff boss next season'published at 13:36 24 April13:36 24 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesIwan Roberts says Aaron Ramsey should manage Cardiff City next season regardless of what division the Bluebirds are in.Cardiff are fighting to stay in the Championship having won only one of their past 10 league games.Ramsey was named caretaker boss following the sacking of Omer Riza last weekend but has suggested he wants to continue playing beyond this season.The Wales captain led Cardiff to a 1-1 draw with Oxford United in his first match in charge on Monday.That result leaves Cardiff deep in relegation danger in 23rd, three points behind 21st-placed Derby with only Saturday's home game against West Brom and a trip to Norwich City remaining in what has been a miserable campaign.Former Wales striker Roberts says that regardless of what happens in the final week of the season, 34-year-old Ramsey should take charge for the long term."He still wants to play – is his body going to allow him [to do that]? I think this is the natural progression for Aaron with all the injuries he has had for quite a long period," Roberts told this week's Feast of Football podcast."I think he's ready made to be a head coach. He is ready to go. Whatever happens, I would love him to be in that technical box for Cardiff next season, in the Championship or League One."Image source, Getty ImagesRoberts says that despite his lack of managerial experience, former Arsenal and Juventus player Ramsey has "all the attributes" required to be Cardiff boss."He looks like a manager, he sounds like a manager, he talks like a manager," he added."He is an intelligent young man. He is in the process of getting his coaching qualifications."He has played for some outstanding managers at the clubs he's been at. I think he's definitely one for the future."Roberts believes Ramsey could yet guide Cardiff to safety – but reckons only two victories will give them a survival chance."It's become desperate," he said."The daft thing is, I think if they can win their last two, I still think they have got a chance of staying up."Caretaker bosses all round as Cardiff fight for survivalpublished at 12:34 23 April12:34 23 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesIt will be a case of caretaker bosses all round as Cardiff City attempt to save themselves from relegation to League One over the next two weekends.Wales captain Aaron Ramsey is attempting to find his feet in the Cardiff dugout, having been parachuted in for their final three games of a miserable season following the departure of Omer Riza.Ramsey's brief spell as interim manager began with a home draw against Oxford United on Monday, which leaves Cardiff deep in trouble heading into the final week of the Championship season.The Bluebirds are three points adrift of safety, meaning they may need wins in both their remaining fixtures – at home to West Bromwich Albion on Saturday and at Norwich City seven days later – to preserve their second-tier status.In what or may not be good news, Ramsey will be up against two other rookie bosses in both those matches.West Brom will be led by former Albion and Scotland midfielder James Morrison (above), who has been placed in caretaker charge following the dismissal of head coach Tony Mowbray earlier this week.And when Cardiff go to Carrow Road, Ramsey will pit his wits against his old Arsenal midfield colleague Jack Wilshere (below).The former England international is at the helm for the final two games of Norwich's underwhelming season after head coach Johannes Hoff Thorup was relieved of his duties on Tuesday.Remarkably, therefore, Ramsey will be the most experienced manager in each of Cardiff's two remaining games, given that he already has one game under his belt.Image source, Getty Images13:29 22 AprilRamsey keeps hope in Cardiff's relegation struggle.

Aaron's going to get asked 'will you take the team for the last three games?'. Aaron's not going to say 'no', of course he's not. "If you're going to give it to him, give it to him in the summer. I don't think it's fair on the fans."Ramsey will be the third person to lead Cardiff this season following the departures of Riza and Erol Bulut.And Earnshaw feels Cardiff are suffering due to a succession of poor decisions made by the club's hierarchy."It's a shot at nothing. There's no pressure on Aaron, if he does this, it'll be amazing," added Earnshaw."I think they need to win three out of three, and that's the type of pressure that I'm saying is unfair."I hope Ramsey can do it. He wants to become a coach, I know he's been working at it. He definitely would have woken up on Saturday morning not expecting a call to say 'do you want to take the team?'. That is very unusual."It just shows a bunch of bad decisions from the club. Erol Bulut last summer was almost going into pre-season not knowing which Cardiff City manager was going to be in charge. "Then he gets it, then a few games later he's gone. Omer Riza takes over, he's here supposedly until the end of the season, then he's gone before the end of the season. "There's been a few bad decisions and it's just putting a lot of pressure on the football club right now."11:14 20 AprilSacked Riza urges Cardiff to stick together, published at 11:14 20 AprilSacked Riza urges Cardiff to stick togetherAttributionCardiffComments42Ramsey appointment a 'roll of the dice' - Blakepublished at 17:00 19 April17:00 19 AprilImage source, Huw Evans Picture AgencyNathan Blake feels Cardiff City's decision to appoint Aaron Ramsey as boss is a "roll of the dice" and stated the Wales captain needs to work a "miracle" to keep the Bluebirds in the Championship.Cardiff sacked Omer Riza fewer than 24 hours after losing 2-0 to Sheffield United at Bramall Lane - a result that leaves the Bluebirds a point adrift of safety in 23rd place.Midfielder Ramsey, 34, will now take charge of Cardiff's final three games of the season, against Oxford United, West Bromwich Albion and Norwich City as his side bid to defy the odds to preserve their second tier status."I just wish Aaron and the boys all the best," Blake told BBC Radio Wales Sport."It's a thankless task. It can't get any worse, it's only up they can go from this position."I think most people have accepted the fate of Cardiff City. They know there's hope because they've got three games left."I think what people are hoping is that a miracle happens, Aaron and his team can win three games and possibly stay up."I don't know how they change the mindset of the players basically overnight, but stranger things have happened."It's a roll of the dice, I don't think there were many options, and I'm surprised they've pulled the trigger at this time, but I'm not surprised at the same time."A lot of fans will see it for what it is. When you're in desperate times, you make desperate decisions. Those desperate decisions, nine times out of ten, they don't pay off. Hopefully Aaron can work a miracle."Having lost his first game as interim boss after replacing Erol Bulut, Cardiff gained 14 points from a possible 18 under Riza to recover from what was their worst ever start to a season.But their form has been way below the required standard since that bright start under Riza, although former Bluebirds and Wales forward Blake feels Cardiff's problems go way beyond the managerial situation."He (Riza) started off well and then it just slowly but surely evaporated. The pressure came from different areas," added Blake."I keep maintaining that it's not a problem that any manager has been able to fix. Collectively there's got to be more responsibility and there's got to be a better understanding of the game and what it takes to manage a football club."The owner (Vincent Tan) sinks in money, that's not the problem, it's how the money is spent that is often the problem. "It's hopefully a solution to a major problem, but if it isn't, it doesn't tarnish Aaron in any way. He's going to give it a go and we'll see what happens."I would have thought he's well respected and the players will hopefully listen to him."12:48 19 AprilCardiff sack Riza as Wales' Ramsey takes charge, published at 12:48 19 AprilCardiff sack Riza as Wales' Ramsey takes chargeAttributionChampionshipComments491'They've seen enough' - Earnshaw on fans' Riza chantspublished at 10:39 19 April10:39 19 AprilImage source, Huw Evans Picture AgencyRobert Earnshaw feels Cardiff City fans have "seen enough" after they directed chants towards Omer Riza following their side's 2-0 defeat by Sheffield United.The Bluebirds remain in the Championship's relegation zone with just three games of the 2024-25 season left to play after goals from Gustavo Hamer and Ben Brereton Diaz earned the Blades a 2-0 triumph at Bramall Lane.Sections of the 1,000-plus away following in South Yorkshire vented their frustration late on, chanting "we want Riza out" and "you're getting sacked in the morning".And former Wales and Cardiff forward Earnshaw believes the Bluebirds faithful aimed the chants towards Riza because "they don't see a way out"."They've seen enough to be honest," Earnshaw told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast."The fans are looking at the team and they are chanting because they don't see a way out, they don't see the manager making a difference."He's fighting for his job, Cardiff City are fighting for a Championship place. This is worrying for me. "I don't think they'll change the manager and I don't think you can because I think it's more disruptive than it helps the team. That would be a complete panic."You've got to really focus on what the team needs, a bit of stability. All of this is a real test for Omer Riza."He added: "What do you say? It is hanging by a thread. It's crunch time, it's nerves, all of those things."Just five points separate the bottom five teams in the second tier with three matches of the regular season remaining.Cardiff - currently 23rd and a point adrift of 21st-placed Derby County, who have a vastly superior goal difference - round off the campaign with home matches against Oxford United and West Bromwich Albion before a trip to Norwich City on the final day.But Earnshaw feels the Bluebirds can still preserve their Championship status over the remainder of the run-in."Of course they can (stay up) because you have Plymouth who are bottom on 40 points. I think it's three teams from five, all the way up to Hull who are on 45 points," he added."Three out of five will go down, Cardiff are in that, that's the disappointing thing."They can get out of it, but it's three cup finals now. They play Oxford, West Brom, my old team, and Norwich, one of my old teams."West Brom is difficult, Norwich away is difficult. I think it's a minimum they've got to win two out of three, but you've got to be aiming for three out of three wins."I worry from what I hear from the manager and the players because we've been accustomed, especially this season, to having a lower level than Cardiff City should have. Cardiff City shouldn't be in this position. "We should be aiming for bigger things than fighting relegation."previous pagePage 1 of 42123456…42next pageHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright © 2025 BBC.
