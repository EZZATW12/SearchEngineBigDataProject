"As a matter of urgency we are requesting a meeting between Vincent Tan and the elected fan bodies to discuss the failings which have culminated in our relegation to hear what fundamental changes are going to be put in place throughout the club from top to bottom to avoid further failings in future. "Continuing the failings of the past that have led to us celebrating our 125th anniversary with a relegation are not going to turn around our fortunes on the pitch."Big changes are needed, and needed now, to avoid a further downward spiral in the fortunes of the club that we fans love."Latest Cardiff City news, analysis and fan views'This storm has been coming' – how Cardiff lost wayPublished1 day agoRamsey 'gutted' but backs Cardiff for instant returnPublished1 day agoCardiff are winless in seven matches going into their final game of the campaign at Norwich City on 3 May (12:30 BST).Their total of nine league wins is the lowest of any side in the Championship this season as Aaron Ramsey's side slumped to bottom place in the second tier as a result of the stalemate with West Brom.While stressing they are grateful for Tan's financial input during his tenure as owner, the Supporters' Trust state "the downward spiral on and off the field will continue" if key matters are not addressed as a matter or urgency.They felt relegation has been on the cards for Cardiff since the 2021-22 season, with a "lack of specialist football experience and knowledge at club board level" being pivotal in their recent woes.The Trust also raised concerns over the managerial situation at the club during the course of the current season, with Wales international Ramsey taking charge until the end of the campaign following the exits of both Erol Bulut and Omer Riza."As the season has progressed and it quickly became evident that things were not going to plan on the pitch, it has been far from clear who on the club board, if anyone, has been advising the owner on footballing matters," the statement added."If any such advice and recommendations have in fact been given, it is unclear if any notice has been taken of such advice and recommendations. "Sadly, this has proved to be a critical element in the club's relegation in our view as the seemingly absolute and unchallengeable power of the owner in all major decisions has failed to work to the club's benefit."They added: "It seems to us that most of the strategic decision making at the club by the owner has been made in what is, effectively, an empirical knowledge and information vacuum."Ramsey has overseen a pair of draws - against Oxford United and West Brom - since the Bluebirds sacked Riza.The 34-year-old - whose Cardiff contract expires in the summer - has aspirations of managing in the future, but recently stated his intention is to return to playing once he fully recovers from a hamstring injury.But after thanking Cardiff icon Ramsey for taking the managerial role during such a turbulent period for the club, the Trust have called for a more experienced boss to take charge ahead of the 2025-26 season."We thank Aaron Ramsey for stepping into an ultimately unsuccessful position as caretaker manager for the last three games of the season," the statement added."However, we strongly believe that for the next season in League One we need an experienced manager at that level, possibly with Aaron playing a part in an assistant role to pick up experience (similar to Craig Bellamy under Vincent Kompany at Burnley and Anderlecht)."Related topicsCardiff CityChampionshipFootballTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8246 viewing8.2k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished5 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
