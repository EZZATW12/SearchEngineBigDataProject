Filo Tiatia's side have now lost 15 successive matches since their only league victory of the season on the opening weekend against Ospreys.Both Welsh sides finish their regular season in South Africa in May with Ospreys playing Sharks and Lions and Dragons facing Stormers and Bulls.Injured Tipuric to miss Ospreys home farewellPublished3 days agoEx-Wales and Lions flanker Lydiate to retire for coaching rolePublished3 days agoWales and Lions lock Beard to leave OspreysPublished4 days agoFond farewellImage source, Huw Evans AgencyImage caption, Lock Adam Beard, who led the Ospreys out with his children against Dragons, has played 58 internationals for Wales and one Test for the British and Irish Lions It was a fond farewell to two Welsh rugby stalwarts with another one denied a chance to say goodbye.Ospreys lock Adam Beard led the side out as he won his fitness battle to feature in front of his home supporters before leaving at the end of the season to join Montpellier.Flanker Justin Tipuric, who retires at the end of the season to become Ospreys defence coach, missed his home goodbye because of injury.Dragons flanker Dan Lydiate played his final game of professional rugby against his former side.Lydiate, 37, will also retire at the end of the season and become part of the Dragons' backroom team.This Welsh derby was played in front of a crowd of 4,677 on a sunny Saturday afternoon. Ospreys are moving to the St Helen's ground next season with the first home game due to be in December after work has been completed.Whether they feature again at Swansea.com Stadium, their home for the past two decades, remains to be seen. Dragons start strong before Ospreys roar backImage source, Huw Evans AgencyImage caption, Harry Rees-Weldon played for Wales Under-20s in the 2025 Six NationsAfter a cagey start, O'Brien opened the scoring with a penalty before his superb hands put Rees-Weldon over for the opening try.Ospreys responded immediately as lock Spencer dived over for his second try in successive games.Important turnovers penalties were secured by Jac Morgan and Lake, who was then comprehensively driven over as Ospreys took the lead for the first time. A four-point half-time advantage was extended early in the second half when Warren burrowed over.Number eight Morgan Morse produced a superb solo run before his final pass to Giles went astray.The home wing could not be denied for long as he scythed through for the bonus-point try.Dragons responded when scrum-half Williams demonstrated some fancy footwork to cross.Ospreys retaliated from the kick-off with another towering aerial catch from wing Daniel Kasende setting up the platform for centre Keiran Williams to send Edwards over.This was the first of a quickfire double for the home fly-half as he crossed for Ospreys' sixth try.Rosser, who moved from wing to centre in the second half, scored before Lydiate was clapped off the field in his final professional game in Wales.Hardy produced an opportunist effort to justify his player-of-the-match award before late tries from Giles and Morgan Williams completed the rout.What they saidOspreys head coach Mark Jones: "I am delighted for the group. We lost a derby last week and it hurt. We have won one this week and it feels a lot better.They now need to follow it up by winning in South Africa with games away to the Sharks and Lions in the final two rounds of the league campaign."It's a tough place to go, but if you want to be in play-offs you have got to go to those places and get results. It's in our hands."Dragons head coach Filo Tiatia: "We were in the game and the boys were competitive but we lost our shape defensively in the last 25 minutes."The learnings are how do we stay in the match.  We are where we are at and we want to be so much better than we were in that final 20 minutes."Ospreys: Jack Walsh; Daniel Kasende, Evardi Boshoff, Keiran Williams, Keelan Giles; Dan Edwards, Kieran Hardy; Gareth Thomas, Dewi Lake, Ben Warren, Will Spencer, Adam Beard, James Ratti, Jac Morgan (capt), Morgan Morse.Replacements: Sam Parry, Steffan Thomas, Tom Botha, Will Griffiths, Harri Deaves, Reuben Morgan-Williams, Owen Williams, Iestyn Hopkins.Dragons: Ewan Rosser; Harry Rees-Weldon, Joe Westwood, Aneurin Owen (capt), Jared Rosser; Angus O'Brien, Rhodri Williams; Rhodri Jones, Brodie Coghlan, Chris Coleman, Joe Davies, Ryan Woodman, Shane Lewis-Hughes, Dan Lydiate, Aaron Wainwright.Replacements: James Benjamin, Dylan Kelleher-Griffiths, Nathan Evans, Barny Langton-Cryer, George Young, Che Hope, Will Reed, Huw Anderson.Referee: Ben Breakspear (SRU)Assistant referees: Gareth Newman & Carwyn Sion (WRU)TMO: Tom Spurrier (SRU)Related topicsDragonsWelsh RugbyOspreysRugby UnionComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 17Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8336 viewing8.3k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished6 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
