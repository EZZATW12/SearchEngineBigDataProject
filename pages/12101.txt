It's unfortunate, but we need to look at that."Darling is out of contract this summer, though Swansea are still hoping to convince the former MK Dons player to commit to a new deal.He has played 39 times in 2024-25 and has been a consistent performer alongside fellow centre-back Ben Cabango.Sheehan says Darling may be available for Swansea's season-ending home game against Oxford United next Saturday."We hope so," he said. "He needs to get assessed, get seen by the physios, and we'll go from there."Darling has been in fine goalscoring form of late, finding the target three times in his past six games to take his tally for the campaign to five. Only Liam Cullen and Zan Vipotnik have scored more often for Swansea this season. Darling's late withdrawal meant the Swans named two goalkeepers on the bench at Millwall, with youngster Kit Margetson joining regular back-up Jon McLaughlin in the matchday 18 because he was the only other player in the travelling party.  18:10 26 AprilTalks over future to conclude next week - Sheehan, published at 18:10 26 AprilTalks over future to conclude next week - SheehanAttributionSwansea16:56 26 AprilMillwall beat Swansea to boost play-off hopes, published at 16:56 26 AprilMillwall beat Swansea to boost play-off hopesAttributionChampionshipComments180'Big club' Swansea must not be 'pushed about' - Vigourouxpublished at 04:00 26 April04:00 26 AprilImage source, Huw Evans Picture AgencyLawrence Vigouroux says Swansea City must not be "pushed about" when they bid to continue their winning run at Millwall on Saturday (15:00 BST).Swansea go in search of a sixth successive Championship victory but face a Lions side who are also in fine form.Alex Neil's team are eighth in the table, three places above Swansea, having won four of their past five matches.Goalkeeper Vigouroux says Swansea are expecting a stern examination at The Den – but that they will take inspiration from recent away successes at Queens Park Rangers and Sunderland as well as last month's draw at Leeds."It will be another tough game but a lot of the games have been tough," he said."We have just got to keep playing the way we have. We dominate quite a lot of teams on the ball and also we have been very dangerous in the final third. If we continue that, it will be really good game."They need to win but we are not here to be pushed about. We are a big club and we have got to go there, go toe to toe and try to get three points."While Millwall are only three points outside the play-offs, Swansea are six points adrift of sixth-placed Coventry City.The Swans are technically still in contention to extend their season going into the penultimate round of second-tier fixtures in 2024-24.Realistically, however, the Swans can begin planning for another year in the Championship – and Vigouroux is hoping this campaign will finish with a flourish."I think the good thing is that we can hopefully take it into next season," he added."We have done really well over the last 11 games. If we can continue that and then go into pre-season, it can only be good for the club."Swansea's play-off chances? Slim to say the leastpublished at 11:32 25 April11:32 25 AprilImage source, Huw Evans Picture AgencySwansea City will take on Millwall this weekend knowing victory may give them a very slim play-off chance heading into the final day of the season – but only if Coventry City lose to Luton Town in their early kick-off on Saturday.Alan Sheehan's side are in sparkling form, having won five successive games to move to within six points of the top six.Swansea must keep that winning run going against Millwall and Oxford United seven days later to have any hope of finishing in the play-offs – but even then they would be relying on a number of results going their way plus a major goal difference swing.The unlikely play-off talk will be over if sixth-placed Coventry get anything from their trip to Kenilworth Road (12:30 BST).Should a Coventry side featuring ex-Swans skipper Matt Grimes (below, alongside Frank Lampard) lose, Sheehan's men – who are currently 11th - would move to within three points of sixth with a win over the Lions, who are eighth.But Swansea would also need seventh-placed Middlesbrough to be beaten at home by out-of-form Norwich City.Image source, Getty ImagesShould all those results happen, Swansea could sneak into sixth place on the final day if they beat Oxford and Middlesbrough win at Coventry – but only if, in the process, the Swans somehow turnaround Boro's advantage in the goal difference column.As it stands, Swansea are on minus four while Michael Carrick's team have a goal difference of plus 10.On top of all that, the Swans would need ninth-placed Blackburn Rovers to lose at least one of their games – Rovers host Watford before going to Sheffield United – and West Bromwich Albion, who are 10th, to drop points in one of their fixtures – at Cardiff City and at home to Luton – to be absolutely sure of finishing above those two sides.All in all, therefore, there will surely be nobody tipping Swansea to reach the play-offs.But it says something about the run Swansea have been on that they are even in the conversation, having been glancing nervously towards the other end of the table not so long ago. Pick of the stats: Millwall v Swansea Citypublished at 10:37 25 April10:37 25 AprilMillwall will look to keep their dreams of the play-offs alive when they host Swansea City on Saturday (15:00 BST).The Lions are three points outside the top six but with their -1 goal difference working against them.Boss Alex Neil is still holding onto hope that they can squeeze into a spot but to do so, they may need to do the league double over the Welsh side - something they haven't done in four decades.Millwall have won three of their last four league games against Swansea (L1) and are looking to complete their first double over the Swans since 1984-85.Swansea have won five of their last seven away league games against Millwall, with the exceptions being a 1-1 draw in June 2020 and a 2-1 loss in March 2023.Millwall have won their last four home league games, last winning five in a row in the same campaign in March/April 2016 (6).Swansea have won their last five league games, last winning six in a row in November/December 2007 while in League One.Mihailo Ivanovic has scored 11 Championship goals this season, more than twice as many as any other Millwall player. The Serbian has scored six goals in his last seven appearances.09:35 25 AprilSwansea in talks with Sheehan over long-term deal, published at 09:35 25 AprilSwansea in talks with Sheehan over long-term dealAttributionSwansea08:05 25 AprilEFL Preview: Points win prizes in survival scrap, published at 08:05 25 AprilEFL Preview: Points win prizes in survival scrapAttributionFootballComments9416:00 24 AprilSheehan 'deserves an opportunity' - Vigouroux, published at 16:00 24 AprilSheehan 'deserves an opportunity' - VigourouxAttributionSwansea'Sheehan very much a Steve Cooper-type'published at 13:33 24 April13:33 24 AprilImage source, Huw Evans Picture AgencyIwan Roberts says Swansea City caretaker head coach Alan Sheehan reminds him of the club's former boss Steve Cooper.Swansea were glancing nervously towards the Championship relegation places when Sheehan replaced Luke Williams in February.But Sheehan's team have since taken 23 points from 11 matches to climb to within six points of the play-off spots with two games remaining this season.Cooper, the former Nottingham Forest and Leicester City boss, began his senior club managerial career at Swansea, leading the Welsh club to the Championship play-offs in 2020 and 2021."Sheehan has done an unbelievable job," Roberts told this week's Feast of Football podcast."All right they are not spectacular - he is not the stat-packed manager that we see in the modern era."He is low-risk. I think that's why the two centre-halves are playing ever so well. They will still get it from the goalkeeper, but if there's any risk, it goes. They get it wide, they get early crosses in. The goalkeeper is not afraid to put his foot through the ball."Sheehan reminds me very much of a Steve Cooper-type head coach. He makes sure he gets his defensive shape solid so they don't concede."Image source, Getty ImagesSwansea go in search of a sixth straight victory at Millwall on Saturday.Last Monday's 2-1 success at Queens Park Rangers means the club are on their longest winning league run since 2007."They have got an edge to them. They look like they have got hunger, energy," Roberts added."The two boys in midfield, [Goncalo] Franco and Lewis O'Brien, I am not sure if I have seen a harder-working midfield duo."They look a different side."11:39 22 AprilLeeds promotion to earn Swans £2m from Piroe deal, published at 11:39 22 AprilLeeds promotion to earn Swans £2m from Piroe dealAttributionSwanseaSheehan not shoo-in for Swans job, says Jonespublished at 09:48 22 April09:48 22 AprilImage source, Huw Evans Picture AgencyOwain Tudur Jones says Swansea City should not just hand Alan Sheehan the role of permanent manager, even after his impressive spell as caretaker.The Swans have claimed 23 points in 11 games since the Irishman stepped in following the departure of Luke Williams in mid-February.Saturday's victory at Queens Park Rangers saw them win a fifth straight league game for the first time in 18 years, but former Swansea and Wales midfielder Jones still believes the club's American owners and director of football Richard Montague should be casting their net wider than just Sheehan."I'd like to see other people interviewed as well and if he stands out above the crowd then brilliant," Jones told Radio Wales Breakfast."But instead of just giving it to him, even though he's done a remarkable job, I would like to see the club having a long-term plan in terms of really pinpointing who the best man will be."Swedish duo Kim Hellberg and Henrik Rydstrom are reportedly among the names Swansea have considered, and they are thought to have spoken to a number of potential candidates since Williams departed following a run of seven defeats in nine matches which had raised fears of a potential relegation fight.After their upturn under Sheehan, the Swans now find themselves just six points below the play-off places with two games to go."It's almost something that we feel comes around every year," added Jones."Swans have a little flirt with relegation and people get worried, then towards the end of the season they pick up and you think 'are they going to make the play-offs?' and it ends up being a little bit too much of a task. It gives people positive vibes going into the summer."The former midfielder, who played for the club between 2005-2009, hopes Swansea can at least this time build on the momentum."You seem to go round in circles. The trick now is going into the summer, it will be another Championship season next year, and it's about the right appointment," Jones added."Whether Alan Sheehan is going to be the next manager - he's really staked his claim, couldn't have done any more - but the club have had time and will have time to reflect and really pinpoint and come up with a plan in terms of who they're going to interview for the job."Whether it's Alan Sheehan or somebody else, hopefully good times are ahead for the club."Look beyond Sheehan? It would be a major call nowpublished at 04:36 22 April04:36 22 AprilGareth VincentBBC Sport WalesImage source, Huw Evans Picture AgencyAlan Sheehan has helped Swansea City claim 23 points in 11 games since taking over as caretaker boss in mid-February.It is form which would be deemed acceptable at any club in the Championship given that Sheehan's points return – when reproduced over a full season, of course – would almost certainly be good enough to deliver automatic promotion.The fact that this sparkling run has come after Swansea's desperate spell at the start of 2025 makes it all the more impressive.Having featured various signs of promise, Luke Williams' Swansea reign ended in mid-February with relegation concerns.The Swans were 17th in the table and a relatively healthy eight points clear of the bottom three when Williams departed.But Williams' ailing side were on a run of seven defeats in nine matches and worries over a potential relegation scrap were growing by the game, the battling victory at Bristol City on 9 February aside.Image source, Getty ImagesFast forward a couple of months and, with two fixtures remaining in the Championship season, Swansea are 11th, only six points outside the play-off places and a whopping 14 clear of the relegation zone.Sheehan's Swansea have been a tough nut to crack, keeping seven clean sheets, but have had enough attacking success to win seven of the Irishman's games while losing only two.As a result, Sheehan has the fans singing his name and various players backing him for the job in media interviews.For the moment, however, there has been no word from the club's hierarchy – whether that be their American owners or director of football Richard Montague – over whether Sheehan has done enough to be offered a long-term contract.As it stands, therefore, Sheehan's stint in charge will be over in a couple of weeks' time.It is no secret that the club have been talking to other managerial candidates, with numerous names at home and abroad thought to have been considered since Williams said his goodbyes.But given the team's spectacular form, it would be a major call should Swansea's decision-makers – all of whom, it should be remembered, are fairly new to their roles – decide to look elsewhere.19:01 21 AprilSheehan waits to see if Swansea plans align, published at 19:01 21 AprilSheehan waits to see if Swansea plans alignAttributionSwanseaComments2116:57 21 AprilSwansea see off QPR to claim fifth straight win, published at 16:57 21 AprilSwansea see off QPR to claim fifth straight winAttributionChampionshipComments11412:11 20 AprilSwansea striker Vipotnik out to reach 'next level', published at 12:11 20 AprilSwansea striker Vipotnik out to reach 'next level'AttributionChampionshipComments4118:27 18 AprilSheehan's 'conscience clear' over Swansea future, published at 18:27 18 AprilSheehan's 'conscience clear' over Swansea futureAttributionSwansea17:02 18 AprilSwans beat struggling Hull with controversial penalty, published at 17:02 18 AprilSwans beat struggling Hull with controversial penaltyAttributionChampionshipComments19408:42 18 AprilO'Brien opens door to Swansea return next season, published at 08:42 18 AprilO'Brien opens door to Swansea return next seasonAttributionChampionship17:26 17 AprilModric 'welcome to a game of five-a-side' at Swansea.

"They are coming to our patch but we expect a very difficult game again. We have decent momentum at the moment but understand that in the Championship, that can be taken away from you if you take things for granted." 16:18 17 AprilSwansea boss search 'coming to conclusion', published at 16:18 17 AprilSwansea boss search 'coming to conclusion'AttributionSwanseaPick of the stats: Swansea City v Hull Citypublished at 15:40 17 April15:40 17 AprilHull City's late leveller against Coventry City in their previous game might just prove vital to the Tigers' hopes of steering clear of the relegation battle.That 1-1 draw keeps them three points above the bottom three but, with their vastly superior goal difference to the three teams in trouble, it's effectively four.The Swans are on a roll, with three wins on the spin and still have a super-slim chance of sneaking into the top six. Swansea City have lost just one of their past nine home league games against Hull City (W3 D5), including none of their last five (W2 D3).After beating Swansea 2-1 in December, Hull could do the league double over them for the first time since 2016-17 in the Premier League.Since beating Rotherham 4-3 in 2019, Swansea are winless in their past four league games on Good Friday (D3 L1).Hull are unbeaten in each of their past two away league games on Good Friday (W1 D1), beating Crewe Alexandra 2-1 in 2021 and drawing 4-4 with Sunderland in 2023.Swansea have won each of their past three league games without conceding, the Swans last won four successive league games without conceding in March 2008.previous pagePage 1 of 42123456…42next pageHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright © 2025 BBC.
