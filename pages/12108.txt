"Some people might look at it from a perspective that we haven't got anything to play for and it's a bit of a dead rubber. That's not the case. "The focus and determination throughout the week will be exactly the same as it should be every other week. "That will be relayed to the players. We want to go to Rodney Parade next Saturday and give the supporters something to look forward to coming back in pre-season."17:33 26 AprilFleetwood beat Newport after game briefly suspended, published at 17:33 26 AprilFleetwood beat Newport after game briefly suspendedAttributionLeague TwoComments610:06 24 AprilHead coach Jardim leaves Newport by mutual consent, published at 10:06 24 AprilHead coach Jardim leaves Newport by mutual consentAttributionNewportClarke likely to miss run-in through injurypublished at 16:20 22 April16:20 22 AprilImage source, Huw Evans Picture AgencyJames Clarke is expected to miss Newport County's final two matches of the season due to a suspected groin injury.Club captain Clarke, 35, was withdrawn late on in the first half of the Exiles' 0-0 draw with Walsall at Rodney Parade on Monday.Head coach Nelson Jardim says the central defender is unlikely to be available to feature in his side's matches against Fleetwood Town and Tranmere Rovers."Clarkey, he's been great, he's been playing a lot of games," said Jardim."We haven't been able to probably rotate the team as we wish because he brings that experience to the backline that we lacked for part of the season."We knew with two games within four days was not going to be easy, he had to come off in the last game as well because he had cramp."We felt that was the right decision to take, and it proved to be right, but with the cost of losing him, probably for the rest of the season which is two games now."Versatile attacker Josh Martin was also replaced during the stalemate against promotion-chasing Walsall.The 23-year-old suffered a head injury as a result of a collision with Saddlers goalkeeper Tommy Simkin deep into added time in the second half."That nasty clash, I have to watch that back again, I don't know what happened," said Jardim."I can recall at the beginning of the season, Jacob Carney getting sent off in a very similar situation with a Cheltenham player for the cup game."I have to look after the player. With the amount of blood he had in his face, that was serious."14:36 21 AprilNewport dig in for precious point to frustrate Walsall, published at 14:36 21 AprilNewport dig in for precious point to frustrate WalsallAttributionLeague TwoComments134Jardim proud of season efforts ahead of Walsall testpublished at 14:17 20 April14:17 20 AprilImage source, Huw Evans Picture AgencyNelson Jardim says he is proud of Newport County's efforts during the course of his debut campaign at the club so far.They have endured numerous difficult spells since Jardim was named as Graham Coughlan's successor last summer and are currently winless in six matches.The Exiles can mathematically clinch League Two survival on Monday when they host promotion-chasing Walsall at Rodney Parade (12:30 BST).Despite plenty of ups and downs since being named as boss, Jardim believes the tougher experiences from the 2024-25 campaign will stand Newport in good stead in the long term."I'm proud of what we have been doing this season," he told BBC Radio Wales after his side's 0-0 draw at MK Dons on Friday."Sometimes things don't go our way. Set plays have let us down in a lot of games, but I'm pleased coming here (to MK Dons), we know they've got a really good manager with a project in front of him."I think this league, it's tough in every game. You can't say you're going to win or lose any game. It's about what you're able to deliver on the day."It's about being consistent. Sometimes teams are not able to do that and we went through those spells. We were expecting to have that this season."Hopefully next season the club will be much better. Hopefully that stability that the club needs, having been through this experience will help the club."Walsall appeared destined to cruise to the League Two title earlier on this year.But the Saddlers dropped out of the top three ahead of their trip to south Wales as their winless run was extended to 11 matches following a 2-2 draw with Harrogate Town.Following the contest with Mat Sadler's side, Newport travel to Fleetwood Town on 26 April before rounding off the season at home against relegation-threatened Tranmere Rovers a week later.16:58 18 AprilMK Dons hold Newport County to stalemate, published at 16:58 18 AprilMK Dons hold Newport County to stalemateAttributionLeague TwoComments8510:16 17 AprilJardim coy on future as Newport County boss, published at 10:16 17 AprilJardim coy on future as Newport County bossAttributionNewport18:23 16 AprilNewport investigation finds no racist incident during game, published at 18:23 16 AprilNewport investigation finds no racist incident during gameAttributionLeague TwoExiles face new manager bounce at MK Donspublished at 13:49 16 April13:49 16 AprilImage source, Huw Evans Picture AgencyNewport County must handle the potential new manager bounce when they go to MK Dons on Friday.The Dons will play their first game under former Rotherham and Derby boss Paul Warne, who has been appointed head coach following last month's departure of Scott Lindsey.MK are 19th in the League Two table, one place and one point worse off than a Newport side who are also struggling for form.The Dons are without a win in five matches – and head into Warne's debut as boss after four straight defeats – while Newport have also taken only one point from the past 15 on offer.The Exiles go in search of just a fourth away league win this season against opponents who have managed only two victories in their past 11 home games.17:02 12 AprilColchester net twice late on to beat Newport, published at 17:02 12 AprilColchester net twice late on to beat NewportAttributionLeague TwoComments56Newport eye more home success against Colchesterpublished at 06:08 12 April06:08 12 AprilImage source, Huw Evans Picture AgencyNewport County will be hoping to maintain their impressive home form on Saturday as they welcome Colchester United to Rodney Parade (15:00 BST).The Exiles have made their home ground something of a fortress this season, racking up ten wins in front of their own supporters, compared to just three victories on the road.As Colchester arrive sitting eighth in the League Two table and aim to continue their pursuit of a play-off spot, County head coach Nelson Jardim knows his side face a considerable test."We know Colchester are top of the form table, we know it's going to be a tough game," he said.Despite the challenge, Jardim is confident that familiar surroundings will once again play into Newport's hands."Home games are massive for us, and we know that," the 46-year-old added. "We speak with the players, and some of them tell me they feel more comfortable playing at home."County's youthful squad features several players with Under-21 international experience and Jardim admits that making the transition to senior football, particularly on the road, has posed its challenges."The U21s level doesn't prepare the players for this type of atmosphere, especially when we're playing away," he said. "You can tell they feel more comfortable, or more confident, when they play at home."The Exiles, who have two further home games and two away trips to come after Saturday, are expected to be boosted by the return of key attacking duo Courtney Baker-Richardson and Kyle Hudlin.Hudlin set for return but Newport suffer Evans blowpublished at 10:01 11 April10:01 11 AprilImage source, Huw Evans Picture AgencyStriker Kyle Hudlin will return after two months out when Newport County host Colchester United on Saturday – but defender Cameron Evans looks set to miss the rest of the season.On-loan Huddersfield player Hudlin, 24, has not played since 11 February because of a calf problem but is expected to play some part at Rodney Parade this weekend.Fellow frontman Courtney Baker-Richardson is also available after sitting out last weekend's defeat at Carlisle United, but Evans has been told to expect three weeks out after a scan on a hamstring problem.Former Swansea City youngster Evans, 24, has made 34 appearances in 2024-25."It's a big blow for us in terms of what he's been offering to us - he's been a great player throughout this season," said Newport boss Nelson Jardim."On the positive side we've got Baker-Richardson back, he managed to go through the fatigue level and he's in a good place."Kyle Hudlin is back as well, we've had three, four sessions with him. He's not ready for the full 90 minutes, but he'll be there with us."Image source, Huw Evans Picture AgencyNewport are without a victory in four matches and have managed just one win in their past seven games.They will look to respond to the dispiriting 3-2 defeat at bottom club Carlisle – a game in which Jardim's team led 2-0 - when they take on a Colchester side who are in play-off contention.The Exiles are 18th in the table, 11 points clear of the relegation places with five games remaining this season.Jardim rejected the suggestion that his team are already winding down towards the end of the season."I disagree with that," the Portuguese said."You should see them training, they're pushing. It's just sometimes it's the way we are, we have to change as players."Jardim apologises to fans for 'heated moment' no-show    published at 12:04 7 April12:04 7 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesNelson Jardim has apologised to Newport County fans for not acknowledging their support after Saturday's Carlisle capitulation, claiming he was caught up in a "heated moment" in the tunnel.Jardim said it was the most frustrated he has felt all season on the road after the Exiles threw away a 2-0 lead to lose 3-2 to League Two's bottom side.Newport were 2-0 up inside 28 minutes through Kieron Evans and Bobby Kamwa, but United turned the game on its head with three second-half goals."First of all, I would like to apologise to our fans," said Jardim. "They travelled in their numbers..."As they will understand, being 2-0 up and then losing it in that way, in the way the goals happened, I had to ask a couple of questions and I was caught up in the tunnel."The Portuguese coach said his "heated moment" kept him in the tunnel "for a long period", which led to him not going to acknowledge the supporters who had made the 560-mile round trip."It's not normal for me. I've been going every game, home and away, and thanking the fans because they've been great to us. "But I think they will understand I wanted some answers. "I was caught up in a heated moment which I'm not proud of, but sometimes the emotions just go through you and I have to fight for my club."County's second-half collapse at Brunton Park led to their fifth successive away defeat as Mark Hughes' side gave themselves a lifeline in the battle to beat the drop.Asked whether Saturday was the most frustrating away performance of the season, Jardim said, "Definitely, yes. "Every game is tough. Especially when you are 2-0 up away, you can never lose the game. It's not good enough."We started very well. It's just a pity because we again fell short when it came to defending duels, aerial balls...when it's a battle we always struggle."County, 17th in the table, now have three home games and two away matches left of a largely disappointing campaign.They will be hoping for a first win in five matches when Colchester visit Rodney Parade on 12 April.   17:07 5 AprilHayden caps vital Carlisle comeback against Newport, published at 17:07 5 AprilHayden caps vital Carlisle comeback against NewportAttributionLeague TwoComments90Jardim demands more from long trip to Carlislepublished at 10:01 4 April10:01 4 AprilImage source, Huw Evans Picture AgencyNewport County will embark on their longest away trip of the season on Saturday - a gruelling 560-mile round trip to face League Two's bottom side Carlisle at Brunton Park.Travelling has been the Exiles' Achilles heel this season, with 13 losses and just three wins on the road, an area Nelson Jardim has been trying to remedy in recent weeks."We are traveling later now, we've looked at the way we rest, train, and eat," said County head coach Jardim."But it's always tough traveling that far. Regardless of that, we know we have to perform."A vocal contingent of more than 100 Newport supporters are expected to make the mammoth trip to north west England and Jardim is determined to give them something to cheer about. "We need to make sure we put on a good performance because we are playing for the fans as well," he added.With six games remaining, hosts Carlisle - managed by former Wales boss Mark Hughes - are nine points from safety and fighting tooth and nail for EFL survival.Newport are 17th having been denied an 11th home win of the season by a late Bromley equaliser on Tuesday.They may have no relegation worries but Jardim insists victory on Saturday remains important as he looks to finish the season strongly and lay the foundations for future success at the club.  "I expect to see more from us, every game has been important," he said prior to the long trip to Carlisle."It's a huge game for us as well."Baker-Richardson's injury blow as Hudlin close to returnpublished at 10:25 2 April10:25 2 AprilImage source, Huw Evans AgencyNelson Jardim hopes Courtney Baker-Richardson's injury is "nothing serious" after he was withdrawn during Newport County's 1-1 draw with Bromley.The striker was replaced in the final stages of the League Two contest at Rodney Parade, and Exiles head coach Jardim says the 29-year-old's potential absence would be a blow given his improved performances of late."Hopefully it's nothing serious. He's been playing every week and was reaching his best level in terms of performance," he told BBC Radio Wales."If it is (serious), it's a chance to have other boys coming in."Forward Kyle Hudlin has been sidelined since mid-February due to a calf injury, but could be in line to return to action at bottom side Carlisle United on Saturday."Hudlin is edging close to being completely fit. Let's see how it goes this week. But like always, we have to find solutions," added Jardim.When asked if there was a chance Hudlin could feature at the weekend, Jardim responded: "Yes there is. He hasn't had full sessions with us yet, but he's played a part with us. "He's probably not ready to play the 90 minutes, but we'll see how he can contribute to us."21:52 1 AprilTop scorer Cheek rescues point for Bromley at Newport, published at 21:52 1 AprilTop scorer Cheek rescues point for Bromley at NewportAttributionLeague TwoComments16Newport seek revenge for Bromley's Boxing Day blitz published at 16:07 31 March16:07 31 MarchImage source, Huw Evans Picture AgencyNelson Jardim has backed his players to improve as Newport County prepare to face a side who tormented them from set pieces on Boxing Day.Jardim's side will look for revenge over Bromley on Tuesday night (19.45 BST) after the south London side scored four goals from set pieces in their 5-2 home win over County on 26 December.Newport will also hope to put smiles back on fans' faces at Rodney Parade after losing for just a second time in eight home league games with Saturday's 2-0 defeat to Notts County."We can only back the players to look forward and improve....I have nothing [negative] to say in terms of effort or commitment as the boys did their best against Notts County," said Jardim."We knew it was always going to be tough playing against a good team. At moments we made it hard for them, and showed we can play good football. "In the last 25 minutes of the first half we were probably the better team. You can pick the stats that suit you, but I'm quite sure we were 50/50 in terms of possession in the second half, so you have to be positive."Jardim expects a "completely different game" against a Bromley side 13th in League Two - five places and six points above 18th-placed Newport."They play a different style," he said."The facts, the evidence is there - in that game [on Boxing Day] we conceded from three corners, one from a throw-in, and the last one was a free-kick just outside the box."We had 70% of the ball in that game, and scored two goals towards the end."It'll be a tough game, but completely different to this one [Notts County]. But we have to look at ourselves and improve the way we want to play the game." Jardim said injured striker Kyle Hudlin will not be back for Bromley's visit, but could be available for Saturday's trip to Carlisle. Defender Kyle Jameson is not ready to return yet either. 16:53 29 MarchWhitaker brace earns Notts County victory at Newport, published at 16:53 29 MarchWhitaker brace earns Notts County victory at NewportAttributionLeague TwoComments2813:44 28 MarchNewport 'not fighting with same weapons' in League Two, published at 13:44 28 MarchNewport 'not fighting with same weapons' in League TwoAttributionNewportNewport wing 'flying' after rest as trio return to trainingpublished at 06:14 28 March06:14 28 MarchImage source, Huw Evans Picture AgencyNewport County will welcome back "flying" Bobby Kamwa against Notts County – having already welcomed back another trio to training.Striker Kyle Hudlin, defender Kyle Jameson and former Cardiff City full-back Tom Davies have all returned to the grass after recent injury spells.None will be in consideration for the visit of the Magpies (Saturday 15:00 GMT), but Kamwa is set to head straight back into the starting XI having missed last weekend's defeat at Grimsby.Kamwa, 25, was rested for the 1-0 loss with Jardim admitting: "Bobby's flying again - we just had to give him a few days rest because he's already played more games than he's ever played in a single season."And don't forget in November he was out for a few weeks with injuries - so he's exceeded what we thought he could do and a rest was something he was needing."The Leeds United youth graduate signed from Burton Albion in the summer, scoring eight goals in 40 appearances across all competitions.  His previous highest appearance tally was 26 games in League One last term.Keenan Patten is also fit again, with Jardim saying it feels the squad are approaching "full power" with the return of the three injury lay-offs.Striker Hudlin is back from the calf injury suffered against Carlisle in February, Jameson is training after a quad tear at the start of the month while 21-year-old Davies returns having been ruled out for the season with a hamstring injury in January."They gave a big effort and it was good to see them running about and nice to see them back," added Jardim. "There was a good energy in the session because they brought that back to the squad."After defeat on the road, Newport are hoping to make it three home wins in a row when the sixth-placed Magpies arrive at Rodney Parade.Newport fans give their views on contrasting home and away formpublished at 12:41 27 March12:41 27 MarchWith one of the worst away records in League Two, Newport County are gearing up for back-to-back games at Rodney Parade - and they are one of the division's best at home. Ahead of the visit of Notts County on Saturday, we asked why there is such a difference between the Exiles on their ground and on their travels.Here are some of your responses.Richard - The away tactics don't seem to work - too much emphasis on just defending. We need to be more positive and use subs better. Home form is good but some performances have been more about defence and very low shots on goal and others much better with shots at goalPhil – We are tactically naive away from home and need an experienced manager for next season otherwise things are unlikely to improve. UTC.Lourenco - The Newport County players are, in all truth, rejected players from all the other clubs and the club has the lowest budget in League Two and most of National league below them, so to be in their position in 17th is a mini-miracle. I think it is only because of the astute reaction from Mr [Huw] Jenkins that their neck is above water - this is Nelson Jardim's first season.Rob - I am a County fanatic, but in all honesty we are a relegation team who have had some immense luck in certain home games, particularly [against] relegation favourites Carlisle and Morecambe. Injuries and selling our best player haven't helped.Mac - Yo-yo is the perfect description of our season. Some games we look like Guardiola's Barcelona and other games it's as if the players boots are made of lead.Andrea - If you had told most Newport supporters that we would have the points we have at this stage in the season and that we would be practically safe, they would have been very happy given our budget and the players we have. The ups and downs are part and parcel of being a football supporter and the lows make the highs extra special.Terry - There is nothing new in a mid-table team doing better at home than away - that is why they are mid-table. It may only take a slight tweak to improve on the road and perhaps Newport should be more adventurous when playing away from Rodney Parade.Home comforts and travel sickness - have your say on Newport's yo-yo formpublished at 15:10 25 March15:10 25 MarchImage source, Huw Evans AgencyNewport County are back at home this weekend, which will be a relief for fans.Because when it comes to playing at Rodney Parade this season, the Exiles have shown play-off form. Their 33 points picked up on their own patch is only bettered by the League Two's top four sides of Bradford City (48), AFC Wimbledon, Walsall (both 40) and Port Vale (36).The problem is for manager Nelson Jardim, their away form has been the stuff of relegation campaigns - with no League Two side picking up fewer points than County's unfortunate 13.That means 72% of Newport's total tally has been earned at Rodney Parade.Newport's latest attempt to stop the rot on the road ended in a 1-0 defeat at Grimsby at the weekend, meaning four successive away losses.It means it will be a welcome return when play-off hopefuls Notts County arrive in south Wales this weekend, before Bromley make it back-to-back home fixtures on Tuesday.And Newport's next attempt to get it right will be at Mark Hughes' Carlisle on 5 April, still desperately trying to climb out of the relegation places.Jardim says he has tried tweaking the routine to get it right away from home, but what do you think the reason is for the difference? And what has been your stand-out home performance this season? The nine-goal thriller against MK Dons? Or one of the vital wins against Morecambe or Carlisle that eased relegation worries?Have your say by sending your views here., externalprevious pagePage 1 of 42123456…42next pageHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright © 2025 BBC.
