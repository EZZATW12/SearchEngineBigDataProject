This is almost a two World Cup cycle and that is what you have to give him."You can't expect results to improve overnight. He has to build, not just the current squad but also the conveyor belt behind it. "Until we get that right, it is an impossible task for anybody."Wales target Tandy for vacant head coach rolePublished6 days agoSherratt hopes Cardiff players stay after WRU dealPublished17 AprilWRU to blame for Wales' rugby woes, admits TierneyPublished20 MarchWide range of experienceThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Tandy has 'all the ingredients' for Wales job - CuthbertTandy has been out of Wales for seven years after coaching Ospreys between 2012 and 2018, winning the Celtic League title in his first season in charge.The 45-year-old left for Australia for a role with the Sydney-based Waratahs before linking up with Gregor Townsend's Scotland in 2019.He also adopted a defence coach role with Gatland's British and Irish Lions squad in South Africa in 2021.Hibbard is a former team-mate of Tandy before being coached by him."Steve is great, he got thrown in at Ospreys as a coach very early on and did a fantastic job," said Hibbard."He is the type of coach where you know he would not ask you to do anything he would not have done himself and the players relate to that."The boys respect his path. When it did not work out at Ospreys, he went to Australia and then Scotland so he has a multitude of experiences in different leagues."He is a Welsh guy who has earned his badges and done well everywhere he has gone."No Japan caretaker coach talks - SherrattImage source, Huw Evans Picture AgencyImage caption, Matt Sherratt is in his second full season in charge of CardiffTandy is contracted until April 2026 and if appointed by Wales, he would be a doubt to lead Wales on the summer tour of Japan in July.Cardiff head coach Matt Sherratt would be a caretaker option after being put in charge for three games against Ireland, Scotland and England during the Six Nations."There has been genuinely no formal contact and I have not been asked officially," said Sherratt."We had conversations during the Six Nations when I was asked if there was nobody in place would you want to do it?"I said we would have to think about that when the time was right."Sherratt has had more pressing things on his mind in recent weeks.There was the shock news Cardiff had been placed into temporary administration before being taken over by the WRU, while Sherratt is trying to help his side qualify for the United Rugby Championship (URC) play-offs by finishing in the top eight."It has been quite busy the past few weeks off the pitch and also preparing for two games in six days so I haven't really thought about it (Japan tour)," said Sherratt."If I got asked now I would have to think about whether it was right now for me, my family or the club."Cardiff top Judgement Day cast as  future exploredPublished20 AprilWRU explains Cardiff takeover in Arms Park addressPublished10 AprilWelsh rugby deal delayed by Cardiff crisisPublished10 April'Take special offer to leave Cardiff'Sherratt has also been touted as a potential permanent attack coach in a Wales set-up headed up by Tandy.The Cardiff boss said after the Six Nations he was not ready to be an international head coach and saw his future at the Arms Park.But what if a full-time assistant role became available with Wales?"In the future, as every rugby player or coach there is always going to be international ambitions and that is no different for me," said Sherratt."In this game there is no point in planning too far ahead. "If the timing and staffing was right and it felt the right thing to do at some stage I would do an international job but I don't know when that is."There has been no contact so my thoughts and efforts are trying to get Cardiff in the top eight."Sherratt says it would take an attractive offer to lure him away from the Arms Park."I love it here," said Sherratt."Genuinely, I've been at three other clubs and this feels the most like home. "My family love coming here, I love matchday here, it's like working with a group of mates which means a lot. "That's a big pull. It would take something significant for me to change that."Related topicsWelsh RugbyCardiffRugby UnionTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8275 viewing8.3k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished6 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
