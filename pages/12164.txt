So much so, there was some surprise at the club that the story did not leak before it did on Monday, with confirmation of the news that bewildered the football world coming by the evening.The club's US-based ownership group – who took over at the Swansea.Com Stadium in November – had been seeking an investor who could make an impact through their profile.Driven by majority owners Brett Cravatt and Jason Cohen, they specifically sought someone with football gravitas and global reach. Six-times Champions League winner Modric ticks all the boxes.When it was discovered the Croatia captain had an interest in club ownership, Swansea reached out with a proposal that eventually led to this week's eye-catching announcement.What information do we collect from this quiz?Why Swansea?Modric's only words on the matter so far are those issued in Swansea's statement.He speaks of the club's "strong identity, an incredible fanbase and the ambition to compete at the highest level".There was little clue, though, as to why he has got involved at Swansea.There is some talk of a link between Modric and Swansea's ownership group, with numerous new faces on the board following the takeover of the club last November.There are also suggestions that Modric – who played against Swansea twice for Tottenham Hotspur in the 2011-12 Premier League campaign – was at least aware of the club's profile and style of play from that time, as well as the subsequent years in which the Welsh side won the League Cup and claimed notable victories at home and in Europe.With that in mind, it seems a successful pitch from Swansea to Modric was enough to turn the head of someone who has already begun building a life outside football with investment in property and business.And with Cesc Fabregas, Thierry Henry and David Beckham among those to have branched out into club ownership, one Swansea source says Modric has viewed this as a chance to try something similar himself.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Luka Modric has 186 caps for Croatia and has played at five World CupsWhat will Modric's role be?No-one should be expecting Modric to make a summer move from Spain to the centre of Swansea's midfield, regardless of the fact that his contract with Carlo Ancelotti's side is up at the end of the season.With a World Cup to come next summer, even if Real captain Modric leaves Madrid after 13 years and 28 major trophies - he is their most decorated player - the Championship will not suddenly be graced by a Galactico.As far as Modric and Swansea are concerned, the focus is on helping the club improve rather than directly influencing games.He has already told club officials he wants to help in any way possible, with Swansea chief executive Tom Gorringe noting how the World Cup finalist has shown a genuine knowledge of how the team are performing.Recently appointed director of football Richard Montague will not see his role impacted, but Swansea do want to draw on Modric's experience, with the club having been criticised in the recent past for lacking footballing nous.What he will not be is someone looking to inject big money into the club.Cabango 'would love' Sheehan as permanent bossPublished13 April'I understand the Pirlo comparison now' Published10 AprilLatest Swansea City news, analysis and fan viewsWhat does it mean for Swansea?It is not known how much Modric has invested in Swansea or what stake he has received – and that may never become clear if he simply adds to the US group that currently has a 77.4% share.However, what the iconic Modric brings is worth more than just cash, with Swansea keen to capitalise on his global reach.The club's owners recently acknowledged they need to drive new income after financial losses and their statement confirming Modric's involvement talked of "helping the club garner global attention".Indeed, his 37.2m-strong Instagram following – where he posted the club's investment announcement – is bigger than that of most Premier League clubs, including Arsenal.One source spoke of the deal helping put Swansea on the map as they seek a new point of difference in the ultra-competitive Championship, as well as the potential to attract better sponsorship and commercial deals.Even the possibility of Modric's involvement swaying some potential signings has been mooted, as well as the general lift the news has brought, with players at the club's Fairwood training base said to be excited by talk of the unexpected new co-owner.With a season to finish at Real – and no indication of his incredible playing career stopping just yet – Modric's association is more likely to be remote than rooted in south Wales.Given the way his shock transition from footballing inspiration to owner and investor has got people talking, that should not be an issue.Image source, Rex FeaturesImage caption, Swansea are 12th in the Championship with four games of the season remaining having eased relegation concerns with a strong run under caretaker boss Alan SheehanA supporter's view An open letter from Swansea fan Steven CarrollDear Luka Modric, Welcome to the capital of Welsh football. We came up against each other during the 2011-12 season, our first in the top flight for nearly three decades. We would remain there for seven seasons and with your help we'd like to get back there. Swansea has a rich footballing history. The backbone of the Wales side that qualified for the 1958 World Cup were born in the city, including the great John Charles, who was voted the greatest foreign player in Serie A history.In terms of local cuisine Swansea is famous for its laverbread, and of course, Joe's Ice Cream. We have miles of beautiful coast, with Rhossili Bay voted among the world's best 50 beaches in 2023.Back to the football though and since Roberto Martinez became manager in 2007, the club has been synonymous with the Swansea Way - possession with purpose as I call it.If you can help us recruit players who suit that philosophy and can help us improve and get back to the Premier League, that would be a job well done. And if you want to leave Real Madrid to see your career out here we won't mind that either!Related topicsReal MadridSwansea CityChampionshipFootballComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 292Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8275 viewing8.3k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished7 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
