"We're bitterly disappointed with how the game finished," Laverty told BBC Sport NI. "There was a period in the second half where we felt we got to grips with the game and we had opportunities to close the gap."They kept us at arm's length. They had goal chances but if our chances go in it gives us serious momentum going into the home straight."Having won last year's Tailteann Cup, Down have an All-Ireland campaign to look forward to. And while Laverty admits his panel have not had enough exposure at the highest level, he feels his players are trending in the right direction. "This is a young squad and they maybe haven't had the exposure of playing at that level," added the Kilcoo club-man. "Division Two helped us this year, playing against Armagh in the semi-final last year and Donegal today. "We're closing the gap, I still feel there are three or four teams in Ulster that are ahead of everybody but as a group we're closing that gap."Related topicsGaelic GamesNorthern Ireland SportTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9139 viewing9.1k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished7 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Northern Ireland sportThe 'rugby student' stepping up to lead IrelandPre-contract agreements - why are they different in NI?Record-breaker Dunlop 'breaks mould' of modern sporting heroesMeet Jude McAtamney - the New York Giants kicker from Derry Elsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
