If it goes to extra-time so be it," said the corner-back, who plays his club football with Down outfit Burren.But his team-mates had other ideas and after they poached yet another of Niall Morgan's kickouts, a foul on Conor Turbitt secured the 21-metre free which Grugan was never going to miss.Burns himself was given the onerous task of marking Tyrone's big forward threat Darragh Canavan and performed the job admirably by restricting the Errigal Ciaran star to only two points from play."With a boy like Darragh, you just have to do your best to get close and sometimes hope for the best. He got a few shots away that he didn't convert too."While Burns' smile said it all, Tyrone manager Malachy O'Rourke rued his team's inability to close out the game after seemingly timing their run perfectly to move into the lead with less than 10 minutes remaining. "We got ourselves in a good position and we're just disappointed we didn't see it out," said O'Rourke, who praised his side's "character" in fighting back from six down to lead.The Tyrone boss lauded the contribution of young substitute Eoin McElholm who kicked two points after his 47th-minute introduction."He was a sort of a spark that lit up the forward line to a degree when he came in. He caused Armagh a lot of trouble and got a couple of great scores and just was a threat straightaway."Related topicsGaelic GamesNorthern Ireland SportTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9934 viewing9.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished8 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Northern Ireland sportThe 'rugby student' stepping up to lead IrelandPre-contract agreements - why are they different in NI?Record-breaker Dunlop 'breaks mould' of modern sporting heroesMeet Jude McAtamney - the New York Giants kicker from Derry Elsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
