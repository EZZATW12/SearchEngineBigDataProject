"To me, that All-Ireland semi-final in 2005 was the most intense game I ever played in," three-time All-Ireland winner Gormley told the GAA Social podcast."It is hard to describe. Nearly every step you took was so important and then when you got the ball, every pass mattered that day - everything mattered."The way the game ended, when Peter got the free, it was such a relief to get that game over and be on the right side of the result."Gormley, who started all three of Tyrone's All-Ireland final wins under Mickey Harte, says he would love to play in the 2005 game again now, 20 years on."It was a crazy game. The crowd was massive, and the rivalry really came to a head that day, it was a mighty game to be involved in."Related topicsGaelic GamesNorthern Ireland SportTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9121 viewing9.1k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished8 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Northern Ireland sportThe 'rugby student' stepping up to lead IrelandPre-contract agreements - why are they different in NI?Record-breaker Dunlop 'breaks mould' of modern sporting heroesMeet Jude McAtamney - the New York Giants kicker from Derry Elsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
