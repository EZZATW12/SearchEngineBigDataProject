Donegal keeper Shaun Patton still had to take the kickout and after the ball went out for a Monaghan line ball, Ryan O'Toole gathered the size five in his hands only for the hooter to sound. Monaghan thought they were entitled to another play but referee David Coldrick blew for full-time as Donegal held on to triumph 0-23 to 0-21. Rory Beggan was among those protesting at the seeming injustice of it all but as journalists scrambled to find out what was the actual rule, it turned out that the Meath whistler had actually made the correct decision - even though it seemed harsh on the Farney men.Donegal survive Monaghan comeback to reach semi-finalsPublished20 AprilUlster SFC: Donegal beat spirited Monaghan to reach last four - as it happenedAs he spoke some 45 minutes later, Monaghan boss Gabriel Bannigan admitted that he was still unclear about the rule."Ryan took the line ball and then the game was blown. Our understanding was that we had that play but I could be wrong on that and we could all be wrong on that," said the Farney County manager."I know if it's a 45 [and the hooter goes] you definitely get to take a 45. I thought it was the same for the line ball but I could be wrong on that. Whether I am or an I'm not, the game is over."His Donegal counterpart Jim McGuinness admitted that initially even he wasn't entirely sure whether Coldrick had made the correct decision."I know Monaghan were scratching their heads. For a moment I was as well," said the Donegal boss.Asked whether Jim Gavin and company should be recommending another rules tweak after Sunday's Clones finale, McGuinness replied: "I don't have an opinion to be honest with you. "The new rules are the new rules. That's the letter of the law and that's the way it should have ended."The hooter went and the ball had been fisted out and once that happens and the ball is out of play, that's the end of the game."This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Highlights: Donegal secure semi-final spot with victory over MonaghanAs for the game itself, McGuinness insisted that there was no panic in Donegal ranks despite Monaghan's second-half revival after his side had led 0-13 to 0-5 after 30 minutes."You trust the processes at that stage. The boys know they were in a game there. It was a very physically challenging game but we dealt with it really well and we're delighted to get through."We're just happy that we were able to keep the scoreboard ticking over at crucial times and never allowed them that moment where they got level or ahead of us."We knew Monaghan were going to come hard at us. Every time they did, we responded really well. "[There were] Some really big performances as well. Shaun [Patton] got the kickouts away well at crucial moments for us. Finbarr [Roarty] had a massive game at corner-back for a young lad. Ciaran Thompson in the middle, Michael Langan kicked four or five points. We're moving on in the competition and that's all that matters."Looking ahead to next Sunday's semi-final against Down, McGuinness said he was relieved that his squad hadn't picked up any more "soft tissue" injuries, with Ryan McHugh having to go off to get a leg gash stitched up before returning to action at the start of the second half."It wasn't restricting him in terms of running so he was able to come back on but he'll be a very sore boy tomorrow morning," added the Donegal boss.Bannigan annoyed by 'three-up' callBannigan admitted his players hadn't "got to the pitch of it" in the first half but lauded them for their display in the second 35 minutes."We had plenty of possession [in the first half]. We had 15 shots and only had seven scores. They had 14 shots and had 12 scores. "Their handling was better. Their passing and efficiency was better and they were six points up at half-time and deservedly so because we had let ourselves down in our play."Donegal had probably benefited from the game [against Derry] in Ballybofey. They were more championship seasoned in the first half than we were."Our bench did well but I thought it was more as a team that we really brought an energy and drive and intensity to our second-half performance and our option taking was better and we took some great scores as well."Bannigan did admit his extreme frustration with a refereeing call in the early minutes when Monaghan were penalised under the new three-up rule, which resulted in Michael Murphy kicking a two-point free.The Monaghan boss insisted that Donegal had transgressed in exactly the same way at precisely the same moment."If both teams breached, it should have been a throw up. It shouldn't have been a free to one team."That was is particularly annoying but we have to take it on the chin."Those new rules eh?Related topicsGaelic GamesTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9052 viewing9.1k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Northern Ireland sportThe 'rugby student' stepping up to lead IrelandPre-contract agreements - why are they different in NI?Record-breaker Dunlop 'breaks mould' of modern sporting heroesMeet Jude McAtamney - the New York Giants kicker from Derry Elsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
