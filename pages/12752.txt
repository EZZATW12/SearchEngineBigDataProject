In transition they are very good, and they deserve to win."After the first goal we pushed some corners and we had our moments but we have to accept it. We were motivated for the semi-final and we lost but we keep going."Two years ago when I arrived here we were in a really bad moment and we are improving and our level is going so quick. Yes of course, we lost in the Europa Conference League semi-final against Olympiacos as well. Everything we are doing is increasing our demands and today the loss is something we have to accept. "Sorry to our supporters because they were motivated. Quick to react because in the league we have the most important objective. Today we lost and thank you to our supporters. Congratulations to Crystal Palace and we keep going. Now it is finished and we focus on the next match."On Marcus Rashford: "I told you he is injured."4911Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingget involvedGet Involvedpublished at 19:57 British Summer Time 26 April19:57 BST 26 April#bbcfootball, via WhatsApp on 03301231826 or text 81111 (UK only, standard message rates apply)Villa clearly second best to Palace tonight, who seem to be our bogey team. We've been knocked out of the Champions League, FA Cup and look unlikely now to finish top 5, but let's not forget the job Emery has done at Villa.

They had to work so hard. They had to overcome a few difficult moments. "We got more control and it was an unbelievable performance today. The players stuck to the plan and we never lost our heads.""We had to do smaller adjustments. Today, Villa played with the front four. A very narrow four and they always try to pass to their sixes. "We said our three attackers, they had to control their two sixes and two centre-halves. "The first goal was about winning the ball and second goal was unbelievable counter-press from Adam Wharton. "The players did excellent."I spoke to the chairman [Steve Parish] a few weeks ago and if our start of the season had worked I would get three months off this summer and then come back one week before the start of the Premier League!"The most important thing is everyone stayed calm in the club. The team, such great guys and they always believed in us and have always had a great togetherness."On celebrating tonight: "I don't know at the moment I feel a bit exhausted - the players have four days off now. "Players should enjoy the moment."1177Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharing'Sometimes football punches you in the face'published at 19:53 British Summer Time 26 April19:53 BST 26 AprilFT: Crystal Palace 3-0 Aston VillaAston VillaMore from Aston Villa's John McGinn, speaking to BBC about why Aston Villa couldn't challenge Palace today: "We weren't at our best, it was clear. But there's big moments in the game that Crystal Palace did better than us. I don't think anyone could watch the game and think Palace didn't deserve to win."On bouncing back: "We have had a lot of praise for last couple of seasons, now we will get criticism. We've got to take it on the chin, puff our chests out and try to stay together. "It is easy for a day like this to disrupt and dismantle what we are building but we are building something special. Everyone within the club and outside the club can see that. The manager, the staff and the owners we've got, this club is set up and we'll be back here."At the moment it stings, but some days football comes and punches you in the face and today is one of those days."Image source, Getty Images8714Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharing'We showed great togetherness and spirit'published at 19:51 British Summer Time 26 April19:51 BST 26 AprilFT: Crystal Palace 3-0 Aston VillaCrystal PalaceCrystal Palace captain Marc Guehi speaking to BBC: "It was a really tough game against really good opposition and in those games, it's about moments.

At least we get to relax and enjoy the other semi-final and see who we will play."From the beginning of the season, every game we go to home and away it is the same noise.

But the manager doesn't have to rant and rave, it was a huge disappointment. "We're going to use the hurt from today to come back stronger next season and hopefully get the supporters another trip to Wembley. The overriding feeling is hurt and disappointment.

They have never lifted the trophy and will face either Manchester City or Nottingham Forest.'Glasner's FA Cup heroes give Tuchel food for thought'Published1 day ago What did you think of your team's performance, Villa fans?Palace fans, what did you make of the game?Palace well worth Wembley gloryThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Eze smashes Palace into lead at WembleyEze and Sarr were the headline double act as Palace continued their quest for that elusive first FA Cup triumph â€“ but this was a consummate team effort from back to front.And it is a tribute to manager Glasner that Palace can play with defensive solidity but also an attacking freedom that encourages the brilliant 'X factor' moments that illuminated the quarter-final win at Fulham and here again.England coach Thomas Tuchel is known to be an admirer of Palace's Henderson, and while the goalkeeper may not yet be in a position to challenge long-time first choice Jordan Pickford, this Wembley performance was that of someone reaching full maturity in a high-pressure environment.In defence, the composure of captain Marc Guehi and Maxence Lacroix ensured Palace were never under sustained pressure, while Adam Wharton brought measure and creation to midfield.It is in attack, however, where Palace have a genuinely thrilling edge to their play, led by Eze, lavishly talented and a game-changer. Villa were punished ruthlessly.After Eze set Palace on their way, they showed real character to recover from the disappointment of Mateta's missed penalty.In the end, they ran out comfortable winners thanks to the contrasting goals from Sarr, the first an arrowed strike from distance followed by the second which combined his pace, skill and composure.Palace fans celebrated noisily and justifiably. On this evidence they will provide a serious threat to either City or Forest in the final here on 17 May.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Sarr long-range strike doubles Palace leadVilla fall short on Wembley stageAston Villa can have no complaints after another big opportunity slipped away. They will be feeling much the same disappointment as they experienced with their recent Champions League quarter-final loss against Paris St-Germain.Yet whereas the Champions League loss could be filed under the bracket of glorious failure, there was no consolation here as they were picked apart by Palace's deadly attack.Villa and their manager Unai Emery could point to a crucial spell just after half-time, when Palace's Henderson denied McGinn and then, perhaps most crucially, dived low to his left to turn away Digne's low drive that seemed destined for the bottom corner.Ollie Watkins, who was "fuming" to miss out on a starting place in the second leg against PSG, got his chance at Wembley with Marcus Rashford injured.The England striker got no joy against the resolute Palace defence.Villa had run out of ideas and energy long before the end, the sight of Sarr racing through to add the third only adding to their agony.Emery's side remain firmly in the hunt for a place in next season's Champions League as they lie seventh in the Premier League, but one bitter blow is following another at the moment.Following on from conceding a last-gasp winner at Manchester City in midweek, the manner of this loss on this big stage will be a particularly painful one to shake off.'It's all about moments' - the goals Palace fans will never forgetPublished1 day agoThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

Palace knocked them out of the League Cup earlier this season, with Spurs the only side to eliminate them from both the FA and League Cups in the same campaign in 1968-69.Crystal Palace have faced Aston Villa three times in the FA Cup and have been eliminated each time, losing 5-0 in the third round in 1912-13, 4-3 in the third round in 1961-62 and 3-1 in a fifth round replay in 2009-10.Aston Villa have reached the FA Cup semi-final for the first time since 2014-15, beating Liverpool 2-1 to reach the final. Theyâ€™ve reached 11 FA Cup finals, with only seven teams featuring in more.This is Crystal Palaceâ€™s sixth FA Cup semi-final and theyâ€™ve alternated between going out at this stage (1976, 1995, 2022) and reaching the final (1990, 2016) in their previous five semi-finals.Aston Villa have lost six of their last eight games at Wembley, with this their first since losing 2-1 to Manchester City in the 2020 League Cup final. Their two wins in this run came in 2-1 victories against Liverpool (2015 FA Cup semi-final) and Derby County (2019 Championship play-off final).Crystal Palace knocked Fulham out 3-0 in this seasonâ€™s FA Cup quarter-final, having been eliminated in eight of their previous 10 FA Cup ties against Premier League sides. They last knocked out more than one Premier League side in a season in 2015-16, the last time they reached the final (four teams).Aston Villa manager Unai Emery has progressed from each of the four single-legged semi-final cup ties heâ€™s managed in, all with Paris Saint-Germain across 2016-17 and 2017-18 in the Coupe de la Ligue (4-1 vs Bordeaux, 3-2 vs Rennes) and Coupe de France (5-0 vs Monaco, 3-1 vs Caen).Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner is looking to become the first Austrian manager to reach an FA Cup final and Austria would be the first new nation represented by a manager in the showpiece event since Germany in 2021 (Thomas Tuchel for Chelsea).In domestic cups this season (FA and League Cup), Marcus Rashford has had a hand in six goals (4 goals, 2 assists) for Man Utd and Aston Villa. Since the start of 2016-17, he has been involved in 40 goals in 60 games these competitions (26 goals, 14 assists), more than any other Premier League player. He is yet to score or assist in an FA Cup semi-final, however, in five attempts.Crystal Palaceâ€™s IsmaÃ¯la Sarr has been involved in four goals in two starts against Aston Villa this season (3 goals, 1 assist), and in his five starts against Villa in all competitions in his career, he has either scored (5 goals) or assisted (2 goals) in each start.HomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright Â© 2025 BBC.
