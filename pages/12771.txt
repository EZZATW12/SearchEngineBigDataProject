The world's oldest football competition - the FA Cup - has delivered unforgettable drama over its 154-year run and with another set of semi-finals on the horizon, it promises even more twists and turns. We revisit some of the most memorable FA Cup semi-finals of the past 25 years.Coventry City 3-3 Man Utd (2-4 on pens) (2024)This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Man Utd scrape past Coventry to reach FA Cup finalManchester United let a three-goal lead slip against Championship side Coventry City but still edged through on penalties in an epic semi-final last year. Coventry, managed by former United striker Mark Robins, looked well beaten with less than 20 minutes to play, but Ellis Simms and Callum O'Hare gave the Sky Blues a lifeline. Haji Wright then converted a stoppage-time penalty to take the game to extra time. Victor Torp thought he had won it in the final seconds of extra time, only for the video assistant referee to rule his goal out for offside. Though it was Erik ten Hag's United who ultimately triumphed on penalties, it was the Coventry players who received a heroes' ovation from their fans despite the Wembley heartache.

But Pep Guardiola's side almost pulled off one of the greatest comebacks in a stirring second-half display. Jack Grealish pulled one back for City just two minutes after the restart and Bernardo Silva added a second to set up a tense finale. The Reds had their goalkeeper Alisson to thank as he made two superb saves to deny Gabriel Jesus as Jurgen Klopp's side kept their quadruple hopes alive.
