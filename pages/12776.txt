City's website says  he is "able to operate in a number of attacking positions".Yet in pre-season, with Rodri absent, O'Reilly featured as a defensive midfielder alongside Mateo Kovacic in a friendly against Barcelona - in which he scored - and against United in the Community Shield.O'Reilly played as a centre-back against Salford and as a left-back when he replaced Abdukodir Khusanov at half-time against Bournemouth.O'Reilly enjoyed a huge amount of joy down the left, with a cross to assist Erling Haaland and pass to play in Omar Marmoush.New City deal? Chelsea? What is his future?BBC chief football news reporter Simon Stone said: "He had his contract updated in 2023 but there are likely to be talks about an improved deal in light of recent performances."There was interest from Chelsea in the winter window but never close."Had O'Reilly, who is under contract until 2028, joined Chelsea, he would have followed fellow City academy product Cole Palmer.Palmer has scored 39 goals in 78 games and become an England regular since his 2023 move.'I'm just grateful for the opportunities' - what he saysO'Reilly spoke to BBC Sport after his man-of-the-match performance on Sunday."My instructions were to get involved as much as I can - in the attacking phase and securing the defending phase," he said."It was good to get the contributions with the two assists. I was buzzing."Towards the start it was a bit challenging because I've not really played there, but I know what I need to do there and I'm just buzzing I can play."I'm just grateful for the opportunities I get from the manager and to play with the players who are out there."'He changed the game' - what they sayAfter the Bournemouth game Guardiola said: "Against Plymouth he scored two goals. Today he made the assists."He's a number 10, we cannot forget. But he has the pace, he is so intelligent and quality with the ball."In the final third he has vision. He played really good and had an impact."City midfielder Bernardo Silva said: "He was unbelievable."Against Plymouth he showed the impact he can have on the game and the energy he brought today changed the game. That's what we need."Will O'Reilly play in the semi-finals?City play Nottingham Forest in the semi-finals at Wembley in late April.It may not have been a serious promise from Guardiola, but it seems likely that O'Reilly will feature at some stage.No player remaining in the FA Cup has more goals than his three this season.Related topicsManchester CityFA CupFootballMore on this storyLatest Manchester City news, analysis and fan viewsGet Manchester City news sent straight to your phonePublished26 July 2022Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions10156 viewing10k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished13 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
