"It will be a special day and I am so pleased for the supporters and overall I think we deserved it."How Forest became penalty kingsThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Forest beat Brighton on penalties to reach FA Cup semi-finalsPenalty shootouts have become the norm for Forest in the FA Cup this season.After a routine 2-0 win over Luton in the third round, Nuno Espirito Santo's side required spot-kicks to overcome League One's Exeter City and then Premier League strugglers Ipswich.A third successive shootout followed on the south coast, with little to separate Brighton and Forest following a drab game which lacked many clear-cut chances.Sels went the right way to deny a lacklustre strike from Jack Hinshelwood before standing tall and getting a strong hand to Diego Gomez's powerful hit."In penalty shootouts you always need a little bit of luck but I'm really happy," the Belgium keeper said afterwards.Sels, who has kept 12 clean sheets in the league this season, was also integral in Forest's two previous shootouts - with the decisive save against Ipswich after stopping one of Exeter's spot-kicks in the fourth round.Nuno said: "Matz saved again. He's been doing really well. It's the third time and we've always been successful. Credit to him."Skipper Yates sealed the victory as Forest became the first team to win three penalty shootouts in a single season in the FA Cup."I was a bit nervous to be fair, just so relieved it went in. Matz saved two penalties and I just knew I had to capitalise and send us to Wembley," Yates said.Did international travel affect teams?This was the first game back for both sides after an international break and it looked like the extra miles travelled by players recently took their toll. Brighton's players travelled a total of 86,208 miles during the break, while Forest's  players combined for a total of 83,054 miles.In a cagey encounter, players appeared fatigued with both teams untidy in possession and lacking quality in the final third."Football needs to address this. I know people will say players get paid a fortune, yes they do," ex-England striker Gary Lineker said."But it's not just about the players' welfare, but the paying public will suffer, as you are not going to get players at their best."When the starting line-ups were announced before kick-off there were question marks over Nuno's decision to rest key attackers Callum Hudson-Odoi and Anthony Elanga, especially with top scorer Chris Wood missing through injury.It almost seemed like the Forest boss had one eye on Tuesday's Premier League meeting against Manchester United - a chance for Forest to solidify their place in the top four and boost their bid for Champions League football next season.Hudson-Odoi and Elanga came on just after the hour mark, and although they struggled to make an impact during the game, the former netted Forest's second spot kick."You've got to give Nuno some credit," said former Manchester United forward Wayne Rooney."We said before the game we thought he made a mistake resting some players, but when they go through you have got to give them credit."Related topicsNottingham ForestPremier LeagueFA CupFootballMore on this storyLatest Nottingham Forest news, analysis and fan viewsGet Nottingham Forest news sent straight to your phonePublished26 July 2022Comments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 649Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9312 viewing9.3k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished13 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
