The 2-1 loss has dropped them to 19th in the table, one point above the bottom three and level on points with Luton below them, ahead of a final day match against Bristol City next Saturday."A scare like this is 100 per cent [a wake-up call]. But all I'm focused on is the preparation and the performance next week. That's it. That's what we mentioned today."The missing bits were in both boxes and we should be having a completely different conversation, but I've said that too many times and that's been the one consistent flaw in our performances."When we've had the performances, when we've had the chances, we've not picked up enough three points off it and that's the tale of it. When we've not been at our best, we've not been able to get over the line like Plymouth have today."It's a tale of both boxes. We were wasteful in their box and they were clinical in ours. That's it."Everything else in between is propaganda when you're looking for results. Even though we controlled that bit, the game's always controlled with what happens in both boxes."17:22 26 AprilPlymouth on brink of drop despite win at Preston, published at 17:22 26 AprilPlymouth on brink of drop despite win at PrestonAttributionChampionshipComments424Preston missing Frokjaer for vital Plymouth gamepublished at 14:52 25 April14:52 25 AprilImage source, Rex FeaturesImage caption, Mads Frokjaer has played in 38 of Preston's 44 Championship games this seasonPreston North End will be without Mads Frokjaer for their crucial home game against fellow strugglers Plymouth on Saturday (15:00 BST).

Poor really, there is no getting away from it."We've got to go out there and make sure that we put in a performance against Plymouth which gets us the result that we need to stay in the division."It sounds a crazy thing to say, but that's the reality."McCall said Preston have "lost too many points in positions where we've been ahead" and the players now need to "stand up and be counted". Paul Heckingbottom's side have led in six of their last eight games, but the only time they have managed to convert that into three points was against Portsmouth at Deepdale on 15 March."So there should be criticism flying around," he added. "It's not where we want to be, it's not where anybody wants to be. Any criticism coming our way is totally deserved and merited."After the QPR game we talked about mentality and desire. That's something we're going to have to look at. "The stats are there. To be ahead in six games and not take a victory out of it - there is something not quite right."Preston's remaining fixtures:26 April: Plymouth Argyle (H)3 May: Bristol City (A)First Tigers penalty changed momentum argues McCallpublished at 11:57 22 April11:57 22 AprilImage source, Rex FeaturesImage caption, Stuart McCall has been assistant to Paul Heckingbottom at both Sheffield United and now PrestonPreston North End assistant manager Stuart McCall says that the controversial award of the first of two penalties in the defeat at Hull City changed the momentum of the game.Leading by Lewis Gibson's first-half strike, McCall argued that the penalty should have not been given.Joe Gelhardt equalised and then scored a second spot-kick to take all three points for the Tigers.The loss leaves North End looking over their shoulders, in 18th place but only three points clear of relegation with two games to go.The Lancashire club are also on a poor run of form, having taken only two points from their last six matches. "The performance was OK to a point in that we controlled parts of the game and got a goal," McCall told BBC Radio Lancashire."I'm not biased, I'll be honest when I see things, I spoke to (Hull defender) John Egan before the game today and they got a penalty given against them on Friday that was scandalous when the ball hit his face. "Today we have had one given against us that is nowhere near a penalty kick."I think he gets the second one right but the big decision is the first one because it gave them the momentum."17:07 21 AprilHull City fight back for vital win over Preston, published at 17:07 21 AprilHull City fight back for vital win over PrestonAttributionChampionshipComments160'Change' needs to happen - Heckingbottompublished at 19:14 18 April19:14 18 AprilImage source, Rex FeaturesImage caption, Paul Heckingbottom succeeded Ryan Lowe as Preston boss at the start of the seasonPreston North End manager Paul Heckingbottom said "change" is needed at the club following his side's last minute loss to Queen's Park Rangers.Lilywhites defender Liam Lindsay opened the scoring just before half-time but the Rs scored twice in the last 13 minutes of the game, with Lucas Andersen netting the winner deep in stoppage time.After the loss, Heckingbottom revealed he had spoken to Peter Ridsdale, a member of Preston's board."You can't park (the disappointment)," said Heckingbottom. "You can't forget it. That's got to be what drives you and makes sure you make the changes."I've just been having a conversation with Peter. I don't need to wait until tomorrow to calm down. Why would I want to do that?"It's obvious what needs to happen. Change or be changed. That's it. How much is possible won't be determined by me. "That's what I'd do but I don't think I'll be able to do that, so it's going to be hard work."17:18 18 AprilAndersen nets last minute winner for QPR at Preston, published at 17:18 18 AprilAndersen nets last minute winner for QPR at PrestonAttributionChampionshipComments158Pick of the stats: Preston North End v Queens Park Rangerspublished at 15:21 17 April15:21 17 AprilBoth these sides should, in theory, have a relatively stress-free end to the season with Queens Park Rangers sitting on the magical 50-points mark and Preston just one point off it.The two sides meet at Deepdale on Friday (15:00 BST) having both taken six points from their past six games.Preston have lost each of their past two home league games against QPR, one more than in their previous 16 games (W8 D7).QPR have won five of their past seven league games against Preston (L2), including each of their previous three encounters with the Lilywhites.Preston are unbeaten in their past eight home league games on Good Friday (W4 D4), beating Rotherham 3-0 at Deepdale last season.Since a 1-0 win at Watford in the top flight in April 1988, QPR are winless in their last four away league games on Good Friday (D2 L2).Only Coventry City (22) have scored more Championship goals from crosses this season than QPR (14), with three of their past six league goals coming via crosses.Heckingbottom on Preston defeat by Leedspublished at 18:45 12 April18:45 12 AprilImage source, Rex FeaturesPreston North End boss Paul Heckingbottom was pleased with his side's application in their 2-1 defeat at Championship leaders Leeds."I'm really disappointed with the two goals we conceded, I thought they were poor on our part," he told BBC Radio Lancashire."We were brave with how we passed the ball and tried to take the game to them, I was really pleased with that."We knew if we could keep one goal in it then we'd get opportunities but they defended their box well and we couldn't open them up."Overall I'm delighted with the effort and commitment of the players but Leeds had the better chances."14:48 12 AprilLeeds beat Preston to go back top of Championship, published at 14:48 12 AprilLeeds beat Preston to go back top of ChampionshipAttributionChampionshipComments680Pick of the stats: Leeds United v Preston North Endpublished at 10:19 11 April10:19 11 AprilThis fixture goes back to the 1924-25 season when Leeds won both matches in the old First Division, scoring four goals in each game.Preston are looking for a first league victory at Elland Road since 2010 when they came from 4-2 down at half-time to win 6-4.Leeds have lost just one of their past seven league games against Preston, (W3 D3), a 2-1 defeat at Deepdale in December 2023.Preston have won just one of their past 12 away league games against Leeds since 1963 (D4 L7).Leeds have scored 80 goals in the Championship this season, just one short of their competition record (since 2004-05) of 81 in 2010-11 and 2023-24.

Then, watching the game, I got a good idea of what Mark [Robins] is trying to do there. "[Stoke] will come at us more with the ball in different ways.
