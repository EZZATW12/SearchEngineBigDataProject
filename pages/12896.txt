I just thought 'hit it and see what happens'. As soon as it left my foot I felt like it was going to go in."Before the game the manager said when you get in those spaces the centre-backs won't jump to you and I checked before Kovacic gave it to me, so I just turned and the turn was good enough to set me up for the shot straight away. The touch was the most important bit, but it was a nice goal."It is amazing, a moment I will never forget for the rest of my life. I don't think it will sink in for a few days but amazing."On what making the final means: "It means a lot. It shows the character that the whole squad has. We can go on about excuses but it wasn't good enough at the start of the season and now we're picking ourselves back up and we've got momentum. We've got the chance of a trophy now and hopefully be in the top four to take into next season."3712Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharing'Three FA Cup finals in a row - amazing'published at 19:13 British Summer Time 27 April19:13 BST 27 AprilFT: Nottm Forest 0-2 Man CityManchester CityMan City boss Pep Guardiola speaking to ITV: "It was a good start. The way we played we did not allow them to make much transitions where they are so dangerous. They also did not arrive much in the final third with the crosses with Wood and so on."In the game they had chances, this is a team that with a game in hand is better than us in the PL. They created a bit more than in the game we played there one or two months ago [in the Premier League]. They are a great team. In general I liked most of the things that we did. "Seven semi finals in a row and three finals in a row years...Not bad!"A few months ago the ball goes inside the post. It goes one side or the other side.Everything is in the head, in the minds of the players.We are in the final so if you said three years ago you would reach three FA Cup finals in a row, come on. It's amazing. "Now we have four finals to go in the Premier League and we have to recover and go again against Wolves."On Rico Lewis: "I am clever but not enough to see that [Lewis scoring]. His positioning in the pockets is extraordinary."On Mateo Kovacic: "Kovacic is extraordinary. The last three or four games have been amazing. At his age he cannot play every three days but we are lucky to have time to recover. We need him for the quality and composure that he has."4117Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingWatch: Josko Gvardiol wraps up Wembley winpublished at 19:12 British Summer Time 27 April19:12 BST 27 AprilFT: Nottm Forest 0-2 Man CityThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.3411Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingPostpublished at 19:11 British Summer Time 27 April19:11 BST 27 AprilFT: Nottm Forest 0-2 Man CityDoesn't this just sum up Manchester City's season?Victory today puts them on their longest winning streak (four) across all competitions since October when they enjoyed a five-game winning run.They haven't managed to string together more than five successive wins across all competitions this season.3419Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharing'Put this behind us and focus on the league'published at 19:10 British Summer Time 27 April19:10 BST 27 AprilFT: Nottm Forest 0-2 Man CityNottingham ForestMore from Nottingham Forest midfielder Morgan Gibbs-White speaking to ITV: "I think if we get a goal then we get another one.

And the main thing is that we came out fighting in the second half."Anthony is a big threat for us and he showed that in the second half. We've got to put this behind us now and focus on the league.

Yet they still created chances, Morgan Gibbs-White's golden chance may haunt him for a while, and their season is still very much alive and they have the chance to achieve something special.

Morgan Gibbs-White rattled the crossbar with a stunning volley, before hitting the post from a tight angle after going round goalkeeper Stefan Ortega.Substitute Taiwo Awoniyi also clipped an effort against the post and once Ortega kept out Nicolas Dominguez's header at full stretch from another opportunity, Forest knew it was not going to be their day as City booked a Wembley return.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Rico Lewis' early strike was his second goal this season for Manchester CityMan City can't 'confuse' season as success - GuardiolaPublished15 hours agoHave your say on Man City’s performanceWhat did you make of Nottingham Forest’s display?City claim historic feat after difficult seasonThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Qualifying for the Champions League is the most important thing - GuardiolaAs red smoke filled Anfield and Arne Slot's men confirmed their coronation as top-flight winners for a 20th time, City focused on another prize as their Premier League dominance came to an end.In the build-up to the semi-final, Guardiola admitted the campaign has not been good enough, regardless of his side claiming a top-five league finish and an FA Cup final triumph.But City and their fans will head back to the capital for a 29th time since 2007 next month - one shy of Chelsea's record tally - with the opportunity of salvaging a poor domestic and Champions League season by ending it on a high with silverware.Ticket prices and the cost of a day trip down south left swathes of empty seats in the City half of the national stadium but those at Wembley, including chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak, celebrated another success on the big stage.They have beaten and lost against rivals Manchester United in the showpiece on the past two occasions, but made more history by becoming the first English side to reach three successive finals in both the FA Cup and League Cup.The early goal set City on their way and they dominated the first half courtesy of Croatian midfielder Kovacic, who dictated play in the middle of the park and provided the assist for the Lewis opener.Gvardiol's towering header provided them with a cushion in the second half and they needed that buffer, riding their luck in a crucial period before progressing to another final under Guardiola's leadership.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Gvardiol's brilliant header doubles Man City's leadForest flat as wait for FA Cup triumph extends to 66 yearsThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Nuno on FA Cup defeat to Man CityEuston train station, platforms on the Tube and the walk up to Wembley were bathed in red shirts as Forest reached this stage of the competition for the first time since 1991, when they went on to reach the final but were beaten by Tottenham.With a place in next season's Champions League within reach, they have enjoyed a remarkable season and their expectant fans packed the east half of Wembley, singing boss Nuno's name loudly before kick-off.But it fell flat thereafter.Injuries and suspension meant 18-year-old defender Zach Abbott was handed just his third Forest appearance, but the defeat meant Nuno missed out on becoming just the second Portuguese manager - after Jose Mourinho - to reach an FA Cup final.The two-time winners, last triumphing back in 1959, had their opportunities to recover from a lacklustre first-half display, but were unable to make their numerous gilt-edged chances count.Elanga should have levelled seconds after coming on as a substitute, while on another day, efforts from Gibbs-White and Awoniyi could all have gone in to turn the game around.But Forest could not breach Ortega's goal and their despondent players now have to focus on the remaining five Premier League matches to finish in the top five and claim a deserved Champions League spot for next season.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Forest hit post three timesThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

season, last beating them twice in the same campaign in 1989-90 (2x league, 1x Full Members Cup).Manchester City have lost four of their five FA Cup meetings with Nottingham Forest (W1), most recently a 3-0 home loss in the third round in 2008-09.This is Nottingham Forest’s first FA Cup semi-final appearance since 1990-91 under Brian Clough, beating West Ham 4-0 at Villa Park before eventually losing to Spurs in the final.This is Man City’s seventh consecutive appearance in an FA Cup semi-final, winning three and losing three of the previous six. They’ve won the last two, and are looking to reach the final in three consecutive years for the first time.This will be just Nottingham Forest’s second match at Wembley Stadium since its reopening in 2007, previously beating Huddersfield 1-0 in the 2022 Championship play-off final. Meanwhile, this will be Man City’s 28th game at the ‘new’ Wembley (as a neutral venue), with only Chelsea playing there more often (30).Manchester City reached the League Cup final in four consecutive seasons between 2017-18 and 2020-21. They could now reach the FA Cup final for a third consecutive year and would be the first side to reach the final of both major domestic trophies three seasons running.Nottingham Forest have progressed via penalties in the fourth round, fifth round and the quarter-final of this season’s FA Cup, the first team to have three shootouts in a single campaign in the competition. They also lost on penalties to Newcastle in the EFL Cup, with Chelsea in 2021-22 the only top-flight team to contest five penalty shootouts in a single campaign.Nottingham Forest boss Nuno Espírito Santo could become the second Portuguese manager to reach the FA Cup final after José Mourinho, who beat Manchester United (with Chelsea) in 2007 and lost to Chelsea (with Manchester United) in 2018.Since the 2021-22 campaign, Ryan Yates has had a hand in eight FA Cup goals in 13 games for Nottingham Forest (4 goals, 4 assists), five more than any other player. He also scored the winning penalty in the quarter-final shootout against Brighton in March.Since his debut in the FA Cup in January 2016, Man City’s Kevin De Bruyne has been involved in more goals in the competition proper than any other player (28 – 10 goals, 18 assists).HomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright © 2025 BBC.
