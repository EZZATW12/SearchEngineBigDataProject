It's not easy to start the game 1-0 down immediately, like against Chelsea, but the team reacted really well again, so it makes 65 minutes until 2-1 and 3-1 and after that we lost what we should do. So you can lose the game what you have to do, you have to do it all the time."It has happened this season.  [At]1-1, we have an action up-field to play Omar [Marmoush] and make a transition, two against one with Savinho and then we lose the ball and after [they] shoot, [there's a] deflection. Many things have happened this season in that terms but you have to, another goal you concede, another goal you concede, another goal you concede. But you have to do what you have to do. If you decide to talk 'we have to do this offensively or defensively' you have to do it. "In the first-half we controlled the game well, we should do it because we have specific players and this is the problem in the last 20 minutes. "I don't have a defence to defend my players, or myself first of course,  for the last 20 minutes but the rest of the game was well played.

We need to
be realistic about it. They normally starve the opposition of the ball. In the second half they
were giving away easy passes. Foden so good on the ball, taking a risk. We didn’t
see Haaland apart from the goal. I want him to be more aggressive, make more
runs, give his team an option. It’s sad to see. I don’t expect them to win the league every
year but the fall-off has been so dramatic it’s sad to see what’s going on. But they’ll bounce
back.273887Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingPostpublished at 19:10 Greenwich Mean Time 2 February19:10 GMT 2 FebruaryFT: Arsenal 5-1 Man CityThierry HenryFormer Arsenal forward on Sky SportsImage source, Getty ImagesDid he see this coming?No, not at half-time. I felt there was a drop after the goal we scored. I’ve seen so many times where we go ahead early and are passive with it. When we’re on the front foot and
put pressure on, nobody can deal with us. But we gave Man City the chance. I don’t
know why at 1-0 they don’t carry on playing higher.95465Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharing'I only regret the last 25 minutes'published at 19:07 Greenwich Mean Time 2 February19:07 GMT 2 FebruaryFT: Arsenal 5-1 Man CityManchester CityMan City manager Pep Guardiola speaking to the BBC: "I only regret the last 25 minutes, we forgot to do what we should do, what we have done for 65/70 minutes. Of course it's a difficult game starting in this stadium, against that team in the first minutes it's happened many times this season. "But after 10/15 minutes I think we took the game and played really, really, really, really good and we are in it after 1-1 and good momentum we pass to make the transition with Omar [Marmoush] and a deflection and the third goal. "But after that, we then continued to do what you have to do in terms defensively and [be a] little bit more patient. and when you're playing that way they can run and of course at 3-1 they are comfortable, its more difficult. I regret the last 15/20 minutes, the rest was a really good game for our side. It's difficult to understand when you see the result but this is my feeling."It's happened all season, we are giving away too many things, we are aware this cannot happen, it happened. But we reacted really well and we played with personality and we defended so good and then with the ball we were a threat but unfortunately after the second happened, again many times we had the momentum. For the deflection and in other situations we conceded the goals."You have to overcome [it], you cannot lose the control, it's 90/95 minutes. You cannot finish in the way we played, we could've scored three more but the team has to be stable it doesn't matter what happened.144525Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharing'Rice a wonderful midfield player'published at 19:04 Greenwich Mean Time 2 February19:04 GMT 2 FebruaryFT: Arsenal 5-1 Man CityJamie CarragherFormer Liverpool defender on Sky SportsI almost feel I’m one of Declan Rice’s biggest supporters. I
find myself scratching my head when I see people criticise him and ask for
goals and assists. I know in recent years we look at numbers, at Arsenal, Vieira
and Petit were two of the best midfielders we’ve seen in the Premier League. Nobody
talked about how many goals or assists they got. Rice is one of those, an all-round
midfielder - a bit like Roy Keane. He’s almost a throwback to a midfielder in a
4-4-2 who can do anything. His power, his pressing, he’s a wonderful midfield
player.1553142Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharing'I can't believe my eyes'published at 19:02 Greenwich Mean Time 2 February19:02 GMT 2 FebruaryFT: Arsenal 5-1 Man CityMicah RichardsFormer Man City defender on Sky SportsThe drop-off has been massive. Lack of control. Lack of structure.

When they needed someone to step up, it was teenager Lewis-Skelly who settled any lingering nerves.Having excelled with some powerful surges from defence in the first half, he allowed Arsenal to establish a two-goal cushion with his goal.Erling Haaland demanded to know "who are you?" when he clashed with the youngster at the end of a fractious 2-2 draw at Etihad Stadium in September, when Lewis-Skelly was booked while warming up before coming on as a late substitute.If Haaland did not know who Lewis-Skelly was then, the Norwegian marksman certainly knows now.The manner and margin of Arsenal's win will surely fuel their self-belief as they try to chase down Liverpool.And the second-half goal rush allowed Havertz to feel both relief and elation after a first-half miss, shooting wide with the goal at his mercy, that started to feel like a defining moment when Haaland levelled matters.Instead, Emirates Stadium was a scene of raucous celebration at the final whistle as Arsenal's title bid received a real turbo charge.Fading Man City collapse againManchester City's alarming habit of crumbling was on show again. Just as against Paris St-Germain in the Champions League last month, four second-half goals were conceded in an extraordinary collapse.This was a side who won an historic fourth successive Premier League title last season. Has an elite team's form ever fallen off a cliff to such an extent?City had brief hope when Haaland equalised, but their demise was embarrassing once Arsenal quickly restored their lead, manager Pep Guardiola looking nonplussed and powerless in his technical area.The injury to Rodri in the first meeting between these two clubs in September, which ruled the world-class midfielder out for the season, is understandably cited as a pivotal moment in the season - but it does not explain the sheer scale of City's capitulation both at home and in European competition.City were shambolic in the closing half-hour, Arsenal threatening to score every time they went forward, the final whistle a merciful release from the beating being inflicted on them.They face holders Real Madrid in the Champions League play-offs for place in the last 16. On this evidence, Kylian Mbappe and company will be licking their lips in anticipation.The Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

last season – they last won consecutive home league games against Man City between 2005-06 and 2008-09 (a run of four).Having won 12 consecutive league games against Arsenal between 2017 and 2023, Manchester City are now winless in their last three against the Gunners (D2 L1).Arsenal are unbeaten in 13 Premier League matches (W8 D5) and have won the most points of any side from MD11 onwards (29). The Gunners have never had a longer unbeaten run under Mikel Arteta, last going 14 without defeat between August and December 2018 under Unai Emery.Manchester City are unbeaten in six Premier League games (W4 D2) and only Newcastle (15) have won more points since Christmas than City (14), while City have scored the most goals in that time (18).Manchester City have lost just one of their last 40 Premier League matches played from January until the end of the campaign (W33 D6), losing 1-0 to Brentford on the final day of 2022-23. They are unbeaten in their last 23 of these games across the last two campaigns (W19 D4), scoring 66 goals at an average of 2.9 per game.Arsenal have scored the most goals via set pieces (12, excl. pens) in the Premier League this season, while opponents Manchester City have conceded the joint fewest of these goals (2, level with Brentford). One of those was against the Gunners earlier in the season however, with five of the last 10 goals that Arsenal have netted against City coming via corners.39.6% of the minutes played by Manchester City players in the Premier League this season have been given to players aged 30 or older, the second-highest percentage in a Premier League season for City behind the 2016-17 campaign (54%).Since Mikel Arteta’s first Premier League game in charge of Arsenal, the Gunners have received more red cards than any other side (19). Despite this, Arsenal rank 23rd out of the 27 teams to feature in that time for fouls per game (10.1).Erling Haaland has scored five goals in his last five Premier League appearances for Man City, two more than he’d managed in his previous 13 games combined (3). He’s exceeded his xG by 1.1 in his last five games (5 goals vs 3.9 xG), having underperformed by 5.2 goals in his previous 13 (3 goals vs 8.2 xG).Man City’s Phil Foden scored more Premier League goals in January than any other player, scoring six goals from six shots on target. He was the fifth player on record (2003-04 onwards) to score as many as six goals with every shot on target in a month, along with Jermain Defoe in March 2008, Dimitar Berbatov in December 2011, Sergio Agüero in August 2019 and Taiwo Awoniyi in May 2023 (all six goals).HomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright © 2025 BBC.
