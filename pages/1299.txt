Liam Charlton-Killen, the father of an 11-year-old boy who began secondary school and the owner of an online schoolwear company, said he has a "foot in both camps" when it comes to the issue."My son has started at a well-known high school in Belfast in first form and I spent nearly £400 in kitting him out in uniform - I nearly died," he said.He said choice and flexibility is a major issue for parents. For his child, he said it was good that there were four or five suppliers for the uniform itself."But there was only one supplier for the PE kit, so they had a monopoly, and the cost was reflected in that."It was £30 for a pair of tracksuit bottoms for an 11-year-old, which is expensive, he tore them on his first day and I got my Mum to sew them, thankfully."He agrees that uniforms should be more cost-effective "across the board", adding that a number of primary schools are going for "an elaborate bespoke kit by well-known brands" that no one else can replicate. "Tops can range in price from £35 to 50, which I would say is very expensive."Mr Charlton-Killen, from Crossgar in County Down, said he hoped the bill will provide more flexibility to parents. "I sell a lot of schoolwear to England and Wales and they are slightly more lenient there in relation to unbranded clothing," he said."It would be ideal if parents here had a choice."'Price through the roof'Janet WardJanet Ward from County Down has two children at secondary schoolJanet Ward, who runs the ADHD Hub in Newcastle, County Down, said the bill "is a very exciting thing to introduce, as a parent with two secondary school children"."The price of uniforms are absolutely through the roof," she told BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme. She said she spent more than £500 each on her children in their first year at secondary school, which included some extra basics like spare shirts."I know with PE socks, I have paid £10 plus for items like that, then you have got your shoes and bags and everything on top of that."She said her teenage son has sensory needs and that it was important that cost-effective uniform clothing was available for everyone. 'I've had mothers in tears'Una Johnston, is company secretary of community group Tidal, based in Toomebridge, County AntrimMeanwhile, Una Johnston who helps run a "pre-loved, re-loved" school uniform scheme in Toomebridge, County Antrim, said the new law is a good idea.She is the company secretary of the community group, Tidal, that runs the scheme - they have uniforms for eight schools in the area and they're all free.Ms Johnston said she has seen the "emotional distress" parents have gone through in trying to acquire uniforms for their children, because of the price."It is just not fair, the current price of uniforms," she said, adding that uniforms should be plain and easy to adapt or maintain. "I have had mothers in tears, they have bought wee Johnny a brand new blazer for school, and then the next day he has fallen and put the elbow out."This law should be brought in sooner, rather than later."Keeva Watson is Northern Ireland development manager of Redeeming Our CommunitiesKeeva Watson, who helps run a similar scheme, echoed those words.She is Northern Ireland development manager of Redeeming our Communities, which provides free uniform items in seven centres throughout Belfast and Dundonald during the summer months.She said the "new law is a starting point for making school uniforms affordable for families". "Much more will need to be done, as school uniforms continue to be a financial burden for families, particularly in the summer months, when preparing for back to school," she added.Fiona Kane, principal of St Ronan's College in Lurgan, told Good Morning Ulster she recognised that if parents have "multiple children to buy uniforms for it can be extremely expensive".She said the authorities need to look at the current uniform grant that's available to parents, and what it covers. "Our own uniform policy has items that are compulsory and then items that are optional."I'm very pleased with our approach to our PE uniform in that the PE kit is cheaper than branded gear."She said she is pro-uniform as it makes it far easier for children "to know every day what they are wearing – it removes those social barriers as well".How much do parents spend on school uniforms?In 2023, a UK-wide report from The Children's Society found parents were spending about £422 a year on secondary school uniforms and £287 on primary school uniforms.The Education Authority in Northern Ireland currently spends about £6m a year to support 94,000 pupils, external as part of the uniform grant scheme.A consultation carried out on the proposed new law attracted about 7,500 responses.More than three-quarters of respondents were in favour of making school uniforms affordable by law. But there were concerns over whether a "cost cap" on uniforms would work.How can parents get a school uniform grant?In Northern Ireland, some families qualify for a one-off payment to help buy school uniforms.The rates for the 2024-25 school year are:£42.90 for primary school pupils born on or before 1 July 2020£61.20 for secondary school pupils under 15£67.20 for secondary school pupils aged 15 and overAn additional payment of £26.40 is available for secondary school pupils to help with the cost of PE kits.There is no grant available for nursery pupils.Applications can be made online and there is no closing date for the scheme, but payments are not backdated.Eligibility for the scheme in Northern Ireland can be found on the Education Authority website.Schools could be forced to explain uniform price under new lawBranded uniforms are a 'financial drain' on parents Minister to consult on school uniform price capNI educationCrossgarSchool uniformNorthern IrelandRelatedApology for autistic teen left without school for over a year5 days agoNorthern IrelandBelfast girls get a taste of the NFL with JagTag7 days agoNorthern IrelandParents devastated pre-school could close over lack of funding19 Apr 2025Northern IrelandMore52 mins agoEx-Irish police officer  'honoured' to lead Disappeared investigationMr Henry's appointment marks the first time someone from An Garda Síochána has taken the role. 52 mins agoNorthern Ireland3 hrs agoAirbus confirms deal for Spirit operations in BelfastThe deal was first announced in July last year as part of a wider break up of the Spirit business.3 hrs agoNorthern Ireland3 hrs ago'Trailblazer' honoured with Blue PlaqueMay Hezlet, from Aghadowey, won her first golf competition at the age of 11. 3 hrs agoNorthern Ireland3 hrs agoDaughter of murdered MP calls for Kneecap apologyVideo emerged of a 2023 gig appearing to show a band member saying: "The only good Tory is a dead Tory."3 hrs agoNorthern Ireland4 hrs agoBranded school uniforms to change for four million pupils under plansThe government says it will save parents £50 a year, but retailers say it could end up costing more.4 hrs agoFamily & EducationBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.
