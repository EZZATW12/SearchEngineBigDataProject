Other respondents said that girls should have the option to wear trousers and "should not be forced to wear skirts". 'Uniforms add extra pressure to families'Emma MorganEmma Morgan said her son's school is "flexible" with school uniforms but that is not the case for all schoolsSome parents also called for more flexibility on uniforms, especially for children with special educational needs (SEN).Emma Morgan is a mother and a board member of SEN Reform NI. She told BBC News NI that with the costs of sending SEN children to school, uniforms added "extra pressure" on families."I have one member of our group who bought her son's full school uniform that he really wears because of his needs."The next year they changed the uniform and she had to buy another full school uniform."Emma's said her experience with uniforms at her son's school had been "flexible"."They have made it child centred, he doesn't like to wear the school trousers or the jumper and they are okay with that."They are looking at it from an empathetic view point."Getty ImagesSchool rules being too strict was mentioned by responders and that no child should be disciplined if they could not afford the correct uniform.Ties were also called "unnecessary and a potential safety hazard". Among the suggestions for keeping costs low were to:Remove the need for school blazersBan branded PE kitsHave a range of shops where uniforms could be boughtBut the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) told the department that while it supported measures reducing the number of branded items in schools, price caps could have "unintended consequences".It said a cap could reduce choice, impact the quality of goods or lead to higher prices if set too high.Getty ImagesAbout 7,500 responded to a consultation for a new law to make all school uniforms affordableMs McBurney told BBC News NI: "I am in support of the price cap, it is really important."She said it was great that so many responded to the consultation."The big takeaway is that action needs to be taken against uniform prices," she said.Others also warned that a price cap could place "unnecessary and additional administrative burden on schools."In a statement, Givan said once the new laws were in place: "It will remain a matter for schools to determine whether to have a uniform and, if so, what that uniform will be."What the legislation will do is work in tandem with strengthened, statutory guidance to ensure that affordability is transparent and at the centre of school uniform policies."It is not yet clear when the new law will be introduced in the assembly.Should there be a school uniform price limit?'I've seen mums cry when they save money on uniform'Minister to consult on school uniform price capNI educationSchool uniformNorthern IrelandRelatedApology for autistic teen left without school for over a year5 days agoNorthern IrelandBelfast girls get a taste of the NFL with JagTag7 days agoNorthern IrelandParents devastated pre-school could close over lack of funding19 Apr 2025Northern IrelandMore52 mins agoEx-Irish police officer  'honoured' to lead Disappeared investigationMr Henry's appointment marks the first time someone from An Garda Síochána has taken the role. 52 mins agoNorthern Ireland3 hrs agoAirbus confirms deal for Spirit operations in BelfastThe deal was first announced in July last year as part of a wider break up of the Spirit business.3 hrs agoNorthern Ireland3 hrs ago'Trailblazer' honoured with Blue PlaqueMay Hezlet, from Aghadowey, won her first golf competition at the age of 11. 3 hrs agoNorthern Ireland3 hrs agoDaughter of murdered MP calls for Kneecap apologyVideo emerged of a 2023 gig appearing to show a band member saying: "The only good Tory is a dead Tory."3 hrs agoNorthern Ireland4 hrs agoBranded school uniforms to change for four million pupils under plansThe government says it will save parents £50 a year, but retailers say it could end up costing more.4 hrs agoFamily & EducationBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.
