and it finished with Antonio Rudiger and Lucas Vazquez being shown straight red cards from the Real bench.That was the last meaningful act of a first Clasico final in a major tournament since 2014, when Gareth Bale scored a fantastic late winner for Real in a 2-1 victory.England midfielder Jude Bellingham was also sent off after the final whistle for angrily confronting officials.Referee takes centre stage as Real rage againImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Referee Ricardo de Burgos Bengoetxea had his work cut outThe pre-match build-up had focused on referee Ricardo de Burgos Bengoetxea and Real Madrid.Real's TV channel published a video criticising the referee in various aspects, as they have done with other officials, and he talked about the impact that had on him at an emotional news conference on Friday.The club distributed highly critical press releases that evening, but denied reports they could pull out of the game.That backdrop meant every decision the referee made was going to be under scrutiny, but to neutral observers there were none too controversial.Both teams had goals ruled out for clear offsides - and Mbappe was denied a penalty for another clear offside in the build-up.But the major talking point came in the 96th minute with the game at 2-2.Asencio slid in on Raphinha, and De Burgos Bengoetxea pointed to the spot. But after a check of over three minutes he came back and booked Raphinha for diving before overturning the decision.Right at the end of the 120 minutes, it all boiled over. As Mbappe tried to shrug an opponent off, the referee gave a free-kick against him. The Real bench were furious. Several players ran onto the pitch and Rudiger appeared to throw something at the official. Rudiger, who had to be held back by several team-mates, and Vazquez were dismissed, and moments later the final whistle went to confirm Barcelona's win.Bellingham also had to be restrained by team-mates after approaching officials in "an aggressive attitude", for which he was sent off.Real Madrid dismiss cup final fears after referee's tearsPublished2 days agoFlick's first major Barca trophy – and Ancelotti's last chance?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Jules Kounde (right) was Barcelona's hero after Lamine Yamal (left) had set up their two normal-time goalsFormer Bayern Munich boss Flick has now won all three Clasicos since taking charge of Barca in the summer. One was the Spanish Super Cup final, but this counts as his first major trophy with the Catalans.Conversely, it could have been Carlo Ancelotti's last chance to add one final crown at Real. The Italian legend is widely expected to be replaced at the end of the season - and they sit four points behind La Liga leaders Barca, although there is one more Clasico to come in the league.This was a topsy-turvy game.Barcelona should have scored more in the first half with Yamal going close, Kounde having a header saved by Courtois and Dani Olmo hitting the post.But Real were much better when Mbappe, who was a doubt with a knee injury, came on at the break. He won a free-kick which he bent into the bottom corner - his 33rd goal for the club. And after Tchouameni's goal, it appeared as if they were going to win.But Torres popped up to beat Courtois, who had rushed outside his box before a tidy finish.There were plenty more chances too, with Vinicius and Raphinha - Brazil team-mates but Clasico rivals - both missing opportunities.In extra time Torres went close for Barca before Kounde smashed in a memorable winner.The fourth and final Clasico of the season, in La Liga on Sunday, 11 May, could go a long way to deciding if Barcelona will win the double. In fact Barcelona - who were missing top scorer Robert Lewandowski for this game - could win the treble, as they face Inter Milan in the Champions League semi-finals.Related topicsFootballComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 709Copa del Rey Scores & FixturesSaturday 26th AprilBarcelona 3 , Real Madrid 2 After extra timeBarcelonaBarcelonaBarcelona32Real MadridReal MadridReal MadridAfter extra timeAETView all Copa del Rey fixturesTeam Lineupshome team, BarcelonaManager: Hans-Dieter FlickFormation: 4 - 2 - 3 - 1Pitch Formation25, Szczesny, Goalkeeper25Szczesny23, Koundé, Defender23Koundé2, Cubarsí, Defender2Cubarsí5, Martínez, Defender5Martínez35, Martín, Defender35Martín21, de Jong, Defensive Midfielder21de Jong8, Pedri, Defensive Midfielder8Pedri19, Lamine Yamal, Attacking Midfielder19Lamine Yamal20, Olmo, Attacking Midfielder20Olmo11, Raphinha, Attacking Midfielder11Raphinha7, Torres, Striker7TorresStarting lineupNumber 25, W.
