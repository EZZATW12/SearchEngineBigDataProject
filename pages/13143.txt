England internationals Harry Kane, Eric Dier and Jordan Henderson are closing in on their first titles with their respective clubs, while Scotland's Scott McTominay and Billy Gilmour are locked in a race for the Scudetto.BBC Sport takes a look at how things stand across the German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch and French leagues. Unlike the Premier League, there are some thrilling title races inbound.Bundesliga - Germany Bayern Munich will be crowned German champions if they win their game against Mainz and if last season's champions, Bayer Leverkusen, lose to Augsburg on Saturday.Kane and Dier are aiming for their first domestic title win since joining the 31-time Bundesliga champions. Ex-Burnley manager Vincent Kompany is also looking to deliver his first piece of silverware with Bayern Munich.Xabi Alonso's Bayer Leverkusen are currently eight points adrift of Bayern Munich with four games to play, and Kompany's side have a huge goal difference advantage over Leverkusen of +29.Both Bayern and Leverkusen are already guaranteed a Champions League spot next season.Italy - Serie AIn Serie A it is a little more complicated.As it stands, last year's champions Inter Milan are in the driving seat as their goal difference separates them from Napoli, who are level on points.But Serie A reintroduced a rule in 2022 stating that if two teams competing for the title, or fighting relegation, finish level on points they are required to meet in a play-off.Goal difference would still play a role though, with the team holding the better record earning the opportunity to host the one-off tie.With five games to go in the regular season, could Scottish duo McTominay and Gilmour become heroes in Naples, or will it be Simone Inzaghi's Inter again?Image source, Getty ImagesSpain - La LigaIn Spain, Barcelona are aiming to win their 28th title and sit four points clear of Real Madrid in second, and 13 ahead of third-placed Atletico Madrid.Barca and Real Madrid have five games to play in La Liga and will meet each other in El Classico at the Estadi Lluis Companys on 11 May. They would clinch the title in that game with a victory if they also beat Valladolid on 3 May and Real lose to Celta Vigo on 4 May.Real Madrid, who won La Liga and the Champions League last season, could finish the campaign with one trophy, after they beat Mexican side Pachuca in the Fifa Intercontinental Cup in December 2024.As well as the domestic table, Barcelona's players dominate the goals and assists chart.Robert Lewandowski, aged 36, has scored 25 goals this season, three more than Real Madrid's Kylian Mbappe, while 17-year-old Lamine Yamal is continuing to prove that age is just a number as he has the most assists in La Liga this season  with 12.Image source, Getty ImagesPortugal - Primeira LigaManchester United manager Ruben Amorim's old club, Sporting, are currently in the top spot in Portugal, level on points with Benfica.On goal difference, only four goals separate the two sides as Sporting look to regain the Primeira Liga title after Amorim guided them to success last season.Unlike Serie A's play-off style, the Portuguese title would be decided by the head-to-head record if both teams are level on points after the final game of the season.Sporting beat Benfica 1-0 in December, and they face each other again in the penultimate game of the season.If both teams are level on head-to-head results, then it goes down to goal difference.Netherlands - EredivisieJordan Henderson is on track to win his first Dutch title as Ajax sit nine points clear in the Eredivisie.Ajax have not won the Dutch top flight since Erik ten Hag was in charge in 2021.Last season's champions PSV Eindhoven are in pursuit of Ajax - PSV have five games left to play, with Henderson's Ajax only four.In the Netherlands, goal difference does hold a little more importance. If Ajax and PSV finish with the same number of points, goal difference is then used to determine the final standings.As it stands, PSV boast a much healthier goal difference compared with Ajax. France - Ligue 1Finally, there is Ligue 1.Paris St-Germain have already been crowned French champions for the fourth consecutive season.Done and dusted? Not quite. Similar to the Premier League, there is quite the race for Europe with six teams in contention for a Champions League spot.Marseille, Monaco, Lille, Nice, Lyon and Strasbourg all have a chance of qualifying for Europe's most coveted competition with four games left to play.
