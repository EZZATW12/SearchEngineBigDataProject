It was saying 'let's make sure we have a process'. He agreed with me and said we need to have more passes and a bit more control," he said."I didn't just say it to Joao. I didn't know there was a camera there. But I still wouldn't have changed anything I did say."Walker explained that there are only a few players in the world he thinks can change a game single-handedly, while referencing Barcelona and Argentina legend Lionel Messi, who currently plays for Inter Miami."The comment I said was nobody is Messi," the ex-Tottenham player added. "That's in every team in the world bar certain individuals who can turn a game on its head when they want to. I give them their plaudits - it's Kylian Mbappe, Vinicius Jr, Mo Salah and Ousmane Dembele, who has been on fire since the start of the year."Apart from that you say it's a team game."Talking about Milan winger Rafael Leao - Felix's Portugal team-mate - Walker said: "What I was saying to Joao is Leao is fantastic. One of the players who you can give him the ball and he can go past three, four, five players and put it in the top bin. "At [Manchester] City most of our joy over the last number of years was from a process. Everything was the process of working out where you were on the pitch. That was with passes."If you have a player like Messi he can take on four players and put it in the back of the net. It makes the game so much easier. "But against good-level opposition like Napoli I feel you need a process of passing the ball and wearing them down. Then the gaps appear. That was the conversation with Joao."Related topicsItalian Serie AFootballAC MilanCould Serie A title be decided by a play-off?Published6 days agoNo-one is Messi, except MessiMore on this storyListen to the latest Football Daily podcastGet football news sent straight to your phonePublished31 JanuaryTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9460 viewing9.5k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished17 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
