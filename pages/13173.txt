The image caught on and now fans carrying giant yellow toothbrushes is the norm. The club even have their own brand sold throughout Norway.Who are Athletic Bilbao?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Athletic Bilbao knocked out Rangers in the quarter-finalsAthletic are a club who traditionally only field players with a Basque background, and as such they are built on emotion and identity.Their home stadium of San Mames has been chosen to stage the Europa League final, meaning players and fans can sense a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, yet the current squad appear to be carrying the pressure lightly.Experienced coach Ernesto Valverde is a calming influence and has his side playing disciplined but exciting football.In Spain's European Championship winner Nico Williams they also have a star man who will surely cause Manchester United problems in the semi-finals.Athletic reached the final of the Europa League in 2012 when they were managed by Marcelo Bielsa, who went on to boss Leeds United.On that occasion they lost 3-0 to Atletico Madrid.Who are Djurgarden?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Djurgarden island is located in StockholmThe club's origins can be traced back to the late 1800s and the island of Djurgarden - which means 'animal island' and is located in the centre of Stockholm.These days their home ground, the 3Arena, is located in the Johanneshov district of the city.Djurgarden have won their domestic league 12 times, but this is the farthest they have gone in a European competition.While semi-final opponents Chelsea are nearing the end of their season, Djurgarden's domestic campaign is only just beginning, but they have not had the best of starts and have won just one of their first three games.Until joining Tottenham last year, highly rated teenager Lucas Bergvall played for them.Bergvall made a swift impression at the club, with one of his early performances leading newspaper Aftonbladet to predict he would become "Djurgarden's biggest transfer ever".They beat Rapid Vienna 4-1 after extra time on Thursday for a 4-2 aggregate win to progress to the last four.Related topicsManchester UnitedChelseaTottenham HotspurFootballThe Debrief: Maguire sends Man Utd through in Europa League classicMore on this storyListen to the latest Football Daily podcastGet football news sent straight to your phonePublished31 JanuaryTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions10257 viewing10k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished18 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
