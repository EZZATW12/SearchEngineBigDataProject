Athletic are flying high in La Liga and on a mission to win this tournament.However, the Ibrox side have had a habit of performing near miracles on the Europa League stage, consistently defying the odds.But when Dessers' ripped shirt only lead to a yellow card for the Nigerian for dissent rather than a penalty, you got the sense there would be no luck on their side.Injuries to Yilmaz, Ianis Hagi, and Balogun forced Ferguson and his staff into multiple changes of shape as they tried to adjust.But luck and injuries aside, Rangers were also outclassed over the tie. Athletic, channelling the energy of a fervent crowd, hounded them out of possession and piled the pressure on in the first half.Rangers went close to holding out until half-time, but Souttar's foul robbed them of the chance to regroup with the game goalless.A brief flurry after the break and the fact their hosts had only found one goal kept hope flickering, but Athletic have the best defensive record in La Liga and largely held them at arms' length until Williams pounced to extinguish it.Rangers can be proud of another good run at this level, but their season is now over and the questions will start about an uncertain future.When will the takeover by the San Francisco 49ers group be completed? Who will the manager be? How many players will leave?These are the only questions left for the club to focus on after a trophy-less season.Athletic impress as home final loomsAthletic, a club who only play Basque players, are built on emotion and identity. A chance to win a Europa League at San Mames is once in a lifetime for these players and their fans, and this squad appear to be carrying that pressure lightly.Experienced coach Ernesto Valverde is a calming influence and has this side playing disciplined but exciting football, with their first-half pressing particularly impressive.While in the second half they kept calm when Rangers had their moments to get the job done with a bit to spare.In Spain's European Championship winner Nico Williams they also have a star who will cause Manchester United problems in the semi-finals as they aim to reach a first final since 2012 when Marcelo Bielsa guided them to the showpiece.What they saidThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, 'I just want my club to get back to where it belongs' - FergusonRangers interim head coach Barry Ferguson: "Obviously disappointed.

The only other time Athletic have hosted a Scottish club was in two games against Dunfermline in 1965, also in the Fairs Cup, winning 1-0 and then 2-1 in a deciding game.Rangers won 3-2 away at Real Betis in their last European game in Spain, having gone 13 away games without winning there beforehand between 1962 and 2018 (D3 L10).On the last five occasions Athletic Club have drawn the first leg of a major European tie, they’ve been eliminated each time. The last time a draw in the first leg was followed up with Athletic getting through to the next round was in the 1976-77 UEFA Cup semi-final against RWD Molenbeek (1-1 first leg, 0-0 second leg, progressed on away goals).Rangers scored in each of their first nine UEFA Europa League matches this season, netting 19 goals. However, they have failed to score in either of their last two, having 27 shots without finding the net.Athletic Club are the only team with a 100% win ratio on home soil in the UEFA Europa League this season, winning all five games. They’ve never won six home games in a major European season before, winning five in 1976-77 under Koldo Aguirre and five in 2011-12 under Marcelo Bielsa.Only Lyon (13) have scored more away UEFA Europa League goals than Rangers (11) this season, while only Lazio (4) have won more games than the Gers (3). Rangers have never previously won four away matches in a major European campaign.Rangers captain James Tavernier has played 62 major European matches for the Gers, level with John Greig, with only Allan McGregor playing more times (78). He’s also made the most appearances of any Englishman in the UEFA Europa League (58 – 56 for Rangers, 2 for Newcastle) and only Andreas Ulmer for RB Salzburg (61) and Matheus for Braga (58) have more for a single club than his 56 for Rangers.Óscar De Marcos could make a record breaking 58th major European appearance for Athletic Club in this match, overtaking former teammate Markel Susaeta who is level with him on 57 games currently.HomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright © 2025 BBC.
