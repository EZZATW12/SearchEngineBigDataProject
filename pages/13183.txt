Control, structure, counter, quality, a player of genius but submitted to the group, they all think the same way. The only way to beat them is if they have to defend a lot in their own box. Barcelona could do that. If that's the final, it's a final for our times. Two Pep Guardiola disciples showing where football is going.Barcelona - Chief football news reporter Simon StoneI went for them at the start of the competition – admittedly because I wanted someone different to win it – and I am not going to change now. They are durable defensively, creative in midfield and have the X-factor in attack. They have not won the trophy since Lionel Messi's time. They will do this season.Paris St-Germain - Chief football writer Phil McNultyOn the evidence of Arsenal's brilliant win over two legs against holders Real Madrid it will be a classic Champions League semi-final against PSG - but I am going with the best team I've seen in the competition this season.PSG wobbled against Aston Villa in the second leg, but they have a strong team - with emphasis on team - and a world-class attack in the shape of Ousmane Dembele, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and a choice of brilliant teenager Desire Doue or Bradley Barcola.Inter Milan - BBC Radio 5 Live senior football reporter Ian DennisI know Arsenal have been very impressive against Real Madrid but the team who appear to have gone under the radar to reach the semi-finals for me are Inter Milan.The Italian champions have the best defensive record in the competition, nobody has kept more clean sheets than keeper Yann Sommer.They have a solid platform and a real goal threat in Lautaro Martinez.It's the second time in three seasons Inter have reached the semi-finals and I just think they could prove to be stubborn opposition for Barcelona.Paris St-Germain - Former Arsenal defender and pundit Matt UpsonIt's easy to change opinion once you get through another set of games but I'm going to stick with my gut feeling of PSG to win the competition.I think they've been standout performers all the way through. They had a real tough spell at Aston Villa and they survived.This side has a grit about it that I've not seen in any other PSG team.Arsenal - Football news reporter Alex HowellI'm going with Arsenal as Mikel Arteta's side have faced a lot of adversity this season and have found their stride in the Champions League. Defensively, they are excellent and with the attacking threat of Bukayo Saka, the Gunners have the quality to hurt any team left in the competition.Paris St-Germain - Senior football correspondent Sami MokbelLuis Enrique has built a team without egos, without the stardust, but look stronger for it. Lionel Messi, Neymar and Kylian Mbappe have gone - but this new-look PSG side represents a triumph for work ethic, togetherness and structure.They made Liverpool look mere mortals over two legs in the last 16 - that's no mean feat. Expect the Parisians to lift their first Champions League.Paris St-Germain - BBC Sport football expert Chris SuttonI think they are such a well-balanced team. They've got rid of all the big hitters now. They've got Ligue 1 wrapped up already so they can concentrate on the Champions League and they just ooze class and quality.Arsenal - Former Arsenal forward and pundit Theo WalcottThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Arsenal's best opportunity to win Champions League - WalcottI want Arsenal to win it and they are certainly capable of going all the way. They will be favourites now, after going to the Bernabeu and beating Real Madrid, but there is something about Inter Milan that worries me. The way they defend makes me think they have a real chance too. It is still so open, though, and I can't even call either semi-final right now, let alone the final - it's too hard to say who will win it with any certainty.Arsenal - Former Manchester City defender and pundit Nedum OnuohaAs I look at the two ties left now, I think it's going to be one of the first-time winners, so either Arsenal or PSG, whoever comes through their semi-final. That's a shame for one of them because they are the two best teams in the competition. It's very hard to choose between the two but I am going to go for Arsenal. Beating Real Madrid, even if this isn't the best version of Real Madrid is one thing, but to go to the Bernabeu with all the talk about a comeback and be so robust, showed they have what it takes. Overall, in terms of how they are prepared to defend  and suffer, and still have a threat in attack, I would argue they are the most complete team left in the competition.Listen to the latest Football Daily podcastGet football news sent straight to your phonePublished31 JanuaryWatch highlights of every Champions League game from 22:00 on Wednesday on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app.There will also be a Champions League Match of the Day on BBC One on Wednesday, from 22:40 to 00:00.Related topicsBarcelonaParis Saint GermainInter MilanArsenalUEFA Champions LeagueFootballComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 576Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions10259 viewing10k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished18 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
