It has been an inspiration for all of us on this competition."The history we have in this competition is so short. The third time in our history of what we have just done and we have to build on that."And now we have to continue to do that because I think we have some momentum now."Former Arsenal forward Theo Walcott, speaking to BBC Sport, said: "Mentally, these Arsenal players are ready for the big time now."What a statement result and performance by Arsenal."'The message will be clear - it's time for Ancelotti to move on'Published17 AprilChampions League semi-finals - how it stands & route to finalPublished16 April'Arsenal's aura is Arteta'This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch full-time scenes as Arsenal celebrate historic winThere were impressive Arsenal performances throughout over the two legs, with Myles Lewis-Skelly defying his 18 years of age and Saka impressing again, but the standout was England midfielder Declan Rice.Following on from his two stunning free-kicks in the first leg, Rice was everywhere in Spain, defending resolutely and looking a threat going forward as he dominated Real's superstars.The hosts did not have a shot on target before the 55th minute as Arsenal made a mockery of Real's star-studded squad and their tag as tournament favourites.Not bad for a team without a recognised striker, with injuries to key players like Kai Havertz, Gabriel, and Gabriel Jesus and with makeshift striker Mikel Merino playing as a false nine.Arteta's preparations for the tie were meticulous, including asking advice on the phone from his former Man City boss Pep Guardiola and testing his players in stressful situations in training.Arteta, said: "I called him (Guardiola) this morning because I am here thanks to him. As a player and a coach he has been an inspiration to me. I had four amazing years with him, and I will always be grateful to him.""Mikel Arteta has built this Arsenal team from his mind and his connections with each individual talent in that team, and he's built them to be one mind," said Walcott."When I say one mind, I mean he's so serious and some people say he's too serious, but everyone's on the same path as him. And that's why I think their aura is him."That's the difference about Arsenal, they don't have the players with the big egos. They're a team and I think Arteta takes it away from the team. I think its a good thing."'He was immense' - Rice lauded as 'one of the best on the planet'Published17 AprilA tale of two penalties & Saka's redemptionThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Arteta praises Arsenal's 'maturity' after Real Madrid victorySaka will be one relieved man after passing up the chance to extend Arsenal's three-goal lead early on - seeing his Panenka penalty clawed away by Thibaut Courtois.The Real goalkeeper celebrated with a wild home crowd as Saka was left to ponder his choice of penalty."It can happen," he said. "I tried something, but it didn't work. I was confident I was going to score tonight."I learn in every moment. Tonight, I am more focused on enjoying the win and then I will review it properly."While Arteta joked: "I would have liked to slap him. But the player has to make the decision, and he was bold enough to do it."That could have been a turning point emotionally in the game because it gave them a lot of belief. But then the way he handled the situation, and the way he played afterwards was incredible."Former Arsenal defender Matt Upson told BBC Radio 5 Live: "I just can't believe the selection of penalty here from Bukayo Saka. I am so surprised. It's such a bad penalty."Walcott added: "This man [Bukayo Saka] typified it from start to finish because he had a night where it could've gone the other way for him but, for me, he is such a resilient character in that dressing room."Mbappe had already had a early goal ruled out for offside before Saka's moment to forget, and the France striker was then involved in a moment of controversy that was to prove key.When he went down in the penalty area under the challenge of Rice, it looked as though Real had been handed a route back into the game when referee Francois Letexier pointed to the spot.A five-minute delay followed before the decision was overturned after a video assistant referee review. "He has his arm round the inside of him and Kylian Mbappe has thrown himself to the floor. That is embarrassing," said Upson.Saka, who was involved in a half-time bust-up with injured Real defender Danny Carvajal, then dinked home to give Arsenal the lead on the night and - despite Vinicius' equaliser - the visitors never looked like losing control.The one blot on an otherwise memorable night for Arsenal was a booking for midfielder Thomas Partey, meaning he will miss the first leg of the semi-final.'The message will be clear - it's time for Ancelotti to move on'Published17 AprilArteta's tenure has been a 'rollercoaster'It hasn't been an easy season for Arteta to say the least.In his five years at the club, he has helped Arsenal recover from mediocrity to become consistent challengers at the top of the game but - with just the 2020 FA Cup to his name - frustration has been growing in some quarters.Having to settle for what looks like second place again in the Premier League and going out of the FA Cup has started to test the patience for some supporters - even though other sections say injuries to players - plus the obvious lack of a striker have been a mitigating factor.The manner of this victory over Real should help to win over some doubters though as Arteta's Arsenal again show their new-found big-game mentality.Over the past two years, Arsenal are unbeaten against the Premier League's traditional big six in the league, winning 12 and drawing eight - a remarkable turnaround from an side who had previously performed atrociously against these teams.Between 2017 and 2023, Arsenal lost by three or more goals to just Liverpool and Man City nine times in the Premier League alone. But, as shown in their European run this season, this fear has disappeared.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, This is just the third time Arsenal have reached the Champions League semi-finals'PSG can beat anyone'This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Saka 'very very proud' of ArsenalSo can Arsenal beat PSG and make their second Champions League final?The Gunners have the second-best defensive record in the competition, conceding just seven goals in 12 matches, while going forward only five teams have scored more.Standing in their way though are a youthful, vibrant PSG side, who many are tipping to win their first European crown.Julien Laurens, told BBC Radio 5 Live: "Over 90 minutes, 120 minutes, I really believe PSG can beat anyone because they have that style of football, the intensity, the energy, the youth, they've got so much talent. "The two full-backs in Achraf Hakimi and Nuno Mendes, I think you can look at the Arsenal full-backs, Inter Milan full-backs, Barcelona, I just think they don't have better full-backs in Europe right now. "And when you've got the midfield three that PSG have plus Ousmane Dembele, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, Desire Doue and [Bradley] Barcola and when [goalkeeper Gianluigi] Donnarumma is on his game, then you have a huge chance of course."Arsenal though will take confidence from PSG's second-half second-leg collapse at Aston Villa on Tuesday night, where Luis Enrique's young side appeared to crumble against heavy pressure.The Gunners also comfortably beat PSG 2-0 in October, although Laurens says the French champions are now a different side.He said: "I think Arsenal are so good without the ball, they are so good defensively. "I know they've conceded goals lately but they're still so strong and this is kind of more maybe than a team that attack you and play the similar style that PSG play, this is where they could be undone."What information do we collect from this quiz?'For us to be here, it's credit to the manager'Arsenal fans outside the Bernabeu on Wednesday night were in a buoyant mood.One supporter, Akkani, told BBC Sport: "Arteta's tenure in general has been a rollercoaster. Now we are in our best moment. Given the context of our season, the adversity we have gone through. The ups and downs. It has been a great season. "It's been the most beneficial season in our recent history. This season more than ever he has had to earn his stripes. He has exceeded all expectations. For us to be here, nobody expected it. For us to be here with this group of players, it's credit to the manager."Fellow Gunners fan Tyler, added: "I think from day one we had a depleted squad that wasn't where we should be historically if you look at an Arsenal side."He has done very well to get us to where we are now, everyone reading off the same hymn sheet. It's exciting. The season hasn't panned out how we expected. "With the tools we have, he has done very well and probably exceeded expectations. It will be a fantastic achievement for us to reach a semi-final and maybe a second final in our history."Related topicsEuropean FootballArsenalUEFA Champions LeagueFootballMore on this storyLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan viewsGet Arsenal news sent straight to your phonePublished26 July 2022Comments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 1021Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions10259 viewing10k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished18 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
