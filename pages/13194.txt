They are usually huge and visually spectacular - and make use of club colours - running the entire height or length of a stand.They can also be like a giant mosaic, where fans come together to hold coloured card or material to form a single image.They are revealed by fans in the stands before a game, and are intended to add to the atmosphere.Why are they becoming common?Tifos are becoming more common as fans seek ways to build atmosphere and try to boost their team's chances of winning.Many clubs refer to their fans as their unofficial 12th player - with some making it official by giving their supporters the number 12 on their squad list. Tifos are a creative way to tap into that fan passion, specifically during local derbies or European football nights.Aston Villa fans have displayed a series of distinctive tifo banners at their home Champions League matches this season, including one featuring rock legend Ozzy Osbourne before their match against Celtic in January.What do they mean to fans?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Borussia Dortmund's Yellow Wall is famous for its tifosTifos are a way for fans to come together to express their support and loyalty.Borussia Dortmund's famous Yellow Wall - homed on the largest terrace in European football - has hosted a series of distinctive tifos, including one as a tribute to long-serving midfielder Marco Reus when he left the club last summer.But tifos can also be used to mock opponents - as happened when Manchester City fans displayed a banner at their match against Real Madrid in February.The banner highlighted Rodri's Ballon d'Or win and referenced the song Stop Crying Your Heart Out by Manchester band (and City fans) Oasis - making fun of the fact that Real boycotted the ceremony because they felt Vinicius Jr should have won.How are they made?Supporter groups plan out their designs, which are then printed or hand-painted.If it is a mosaic banner, coloured card is left on seats or terracing for fans to hold up at the right moment.Tifos are often paid for by fans, through groups or funding, though clubs and players can get involved too.Fans will arrive at the stadium early, ready to set up the banner.
