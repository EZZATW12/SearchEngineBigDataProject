Maybe we ran out of luck because the margins were so small."We played the perfect game, except for scoring a goal. It was similar to Paris last week, when they played the perfect game and didn't score. And then in extra time, they were maybe a little bit better."Defeat leaves Liverpool with a domestic double to play for. With a 15-point lead at the top, the Reds are all but certain of winning the Premier League, while they face Newcastle in the Carabao Cup final at Wembley on Sunday."We were pretty good and you want to go as far as possible, but we knew when we drew Paris that it was going to be very difficult," admitted Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk."In Paris, we struggled but we won. Today we saw a very good Liverpool side, but we're out of the competition."Scotland left-back Andy Robertson said the focus will turn to Newcastle now as he added: "It wasn't meant to be and we need to dust ourselves down. We always bounce back, there's a lot of tired legs in there. Cup finals, we enjoy them, and that's the biggest game."PSG boss Luis Enrique felt Liverpool were unlucky as he said: "Both of the teams deserve to go to the next phase."They played better than us here, but I think my team at Anfield, in a special stadium showed great personality and character."I think it shows clearly the team we are."Alexander-Arnold doubtful for finalLiverpool defender Trent Alexander-Arnold is a doubt for Sunday's final against Newcastle at Wembley.The England defender was substituted in the second half against PSG after appearing to jar a knee in a challenge with Vitinha."He had to come off - that's never a good sign," said Slot."From what I heard from people that saw the images of how he got injured, it didn't look very good."I would be surprised if he is [available] for Sunday."Alexander-Arnold missed last year's EFL Cup final win over Chelsea. England manager Thomas Tuchel will name his first squad on Friday for World Cup qualifiers against Latvia and Albania this month.Alexander-Arnold, who has 33 caps, was expected to be included.Related topicsLiverpoolParis Saint GermainEuropean FootballUEFA Champions LeagueFootball'Nunez not to blame - but you felt his miss carried more weight'Published12 MarchMore on this storyListen to the latest Football Daily podcastGet football news sent straight to your phonePublished31 JanuaryComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 929Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions10218 viewing10k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished19 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
