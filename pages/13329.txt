But I signed because I think we have a chance to win other trophies and enjoy my football."I have played eight years here, hopefully it's going to be 10. I'm enjoying my life here, enjoying my football. I have had the best years of my career here."Salah has scored 32 goals in all competitions this season, including 27 in the Premier League as the Reds chase a 20th top-flight title. He is averaging the most goal involvements per 90 minutes (1.44) in the Premier League this season - the most of any player in a single campaign.Liverpool are 11 points clear of second-placed Arsenal with seven games remaining.Salah, who joined Liverpool from Roma in 2017, has won the Champions League, Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup and Fifa Club World Cup with the Reds.He was one of three key Liverpool players who will be out of contract this summer, along with right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold and centre-back Virgil van Dijk.Netherlands defender Van Dijk has said there has been progress on talks over a new deal but Alexander-Arnold has been heavily linked with a move to Real Madrid.Salah's previous deal was understood to be worth more than £350,000 a week and made him the highest-paid player in the club's history.It is believed negotiations over his new contract did not involve a pay cut.When Liverpool nearly missed out on SalahPublished3 April'Perfect marriage goes on - Liverpool and Salah need each other'Published11 AprilReal in talks over finalising Alexander-Arnold signingPublished25 MarchLong-running Salah saga finally endsThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Slot 'very happy' with Salah contract extensionAmid uncertainty about his future, Salah has already had his second-best season in terms of league goals at Liverpool in 2024-25. With seven games left, he could feasibly reach the 32 he scored in his first campaign.In September, he said in a Sky Sports interview it was his "last season" at Anfield because nobody at the club had talked to him about a new contract.Those comments were made after he had scored in a 3-0 win at Manchester United - a match he had treated like it was his last at Old Trafford. Two months later, following a win at Southampton, Salah stated he was "disappointed" at not having been offered a new deal by Liverpool and that he was "probably more out than in".At the time, the Reds claimed positive talks had been taking place with the player's representative.However, in January Salah again spoke publicly about his contract situation when he said the two parties were "far away from any progress".The forward has consistently been linked with a move to Saudi Arabia, with Liverpool rejecting a £150m offer from Al-Ittihad for Salah in 2023.Saudi Arabia's sports minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al-Faisal had said the forward would be "a big prize" and they "would love to have him".However, Liverpool manager Arne Slot said in January he wanted the player to stay and Salah is "wise enough to make the right decision" over his future.In announcing Salah's new deal, Liverpool posted a picture of the player - who is nicknamed the 'Egyptian King' - sat on a throne on the Anfield pitch with the caption 'more in than out'.

Salah reaction and Premier League weekend previewSalah's mentality impresses SlotThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Are Liverpool taking a gamble with Mohamed Salah?Slot, speaking before his side's game against West Ham on Sunday, said he was "happy" Salah had chosen to stay given he would have been a free agent in the summer and could go to "probably any club in the world".The Dutchman added: "First of all, he has always been judged as a player but I also see him as a human being and he is a humble person. "He always wants to work hard and always puts a lot of effort into becoming the player he has become. He wants to stay at that level, so he just keeps on bringing that effort every single day."What makes him special on the pitch, in my opinion, is that he can score goals. "There are other players who can score goals, but Mo can score a goal even if he is not in the best half an hour or best 15 minutes - and that's why he is mentally so strong."You need to be that if you want to be at the highest level every three or four days for seven or eight years. Apart from quality and physique, you need to be mentally really strong as well."Apart from all the other things, how mentally strong he is is probably what stands out for me."This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch "How to Win the Champions League: Liverpool" on iPlayer nowSalah's seasons in statisticsAnalysis - The importance of contracts being two yearsBBC Sport senior football reporter Sami MokbelThere is a growing expectation at Liverpool that captain Virgil van Dijk will join forward Mohamed Salah in signing a new contract.Following months of discussions it is understood Van Dijk is extremely close to signing what would be a new two-year contract.There is an importance to both contracts being two years in length.The first, and most obvious, benefit to Liverpool is they get to keep two of their most important players.But it also means they can avoid a repeat of the unsettling narrative that has clouded Arne Slot's first season as manager for at least another year.Liverpool, barring what would be a remarkable capitulation, are set to win their 20th league title - yet the achievement has come against the backdrop of Van Dijk, Salah and defender Trent Alexander-Arnold approaching the end of their contracts.The club's hopes of retaining Alexander-Arnold have waned in recent weeks, with the right-back in talks with Real Madrid over a free transfer in the summer.Related topicsLiverpoolPremier LeagueFootballMore on this storyLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan viewsGet Liverpool news sent straight to your phonePublished26 July 2022Comments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 1362Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions10218 viewing10k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished19 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
