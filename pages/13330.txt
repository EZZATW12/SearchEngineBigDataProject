"This is a pathway and a stepping stone to that."By the summer of 2024, he had just a year left on his contract and with no suggestion that a new deal was close to being agreed, the relationship between Liverpool fans and Alexander-Arnold has become more strained.Alexander-Arnold irritated some Reds supporters in October by saying in an interview with Sky Sports that he would rather win a Ballon d'Or,, external football's most prestigious individual honour, than another Champions League with Liverpool.Since then, there has been a belief among some fans that he is more focused on his own achievements.In December, he celebrated scoring against West Ham with a 'chat' gesture, referencing the gossip about his future.That brought more fan frustration given that by not publicly stating his desire to stay or leave, Alexander-Arnold had done little to quieten speculation over where he will be playing football next season.Reports that Real had made an offer to bring the Liverpool number 66 to Madrid in January coincided with a tough afternoon for Alexander-Arnold against Manchester United, leading to abuse from some of his own fans inside Anfield.While the defender has helped put Liverpool in a strong position to win the Premier League title in the months since, it remains to be seen what kind of reception Alexander-Arnold will receive from supporters as he looks increasingly likely to leave his boyhood club for nothing.'No doubt Trent would be a superstar in Madrid'Should Alexander-Arnold join Real, he would emulate Steve McManaman, who moved from Liverpool to Madrid on a free transfer in 1999."If he does choose to go to Real Madrid and he does choose to forge a new adventure with a new language and a new lifestyle, all credit to him," McManaman told BBC Sport."It's a fantastic opportunity for him if he does go, and no doubt that he will be a superstar there as well."Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk and top-scorer Mohamed Salah are also out of contract at the end of the season but McManaman thinks a homegrown player like Alexander-Arnold leaving for free would be viewed differently by supporters."It's unfair [to expect homegrown players to commit to one club for their entire career]. If Van Dijk or Salah leave then it it's Liverpool's fault, if Trent were to leave then it's Trent's fault," he added.While Northern Ireland international Conor Bradley has proven a reliable replacement when called up in the past two seasons, McManaman believes Alexander-Arnold would leave "a considerable hole" at Liverpool. "[Bradley is] a completely different player to Trent Alexander-Arnold," the two-time Champions League winner said."Trent's numbers in an attacking sense are absolutely fantastic... but Liverpool fans and everybody will hope that Conor Bradley will be able to fill that void."You have a standard level and every year, you try and improve and get better and better. "We all hope that Conor Bradley achieves that and becomes the superstar that people are talking about when they talk about Trent Alexander-Arnold."Related topicsLiverpoolPremier LeagueReal MadridFootballMore on this storyHow Anfield's Alexander-Arnold toxicity came to a headPublished6 JanuaryLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan viewsGet Liverpool news sent straight to your phonePublished26 July 2022Comments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 2459Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions10218 viewing10k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished19 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
