But the Portuguese coach arrives at Old Trafford with a reputation as one of Europe's most promising managers. The former Portugal midfielder started his managerial career with third-tier Casa Pia in 2018.He joined Braga's B team the next summer and managed the side for just 11 matches until being appointed manager of the first team where he oversaw 13 games before Sporting made a move.In his 13 matches in charge, Amorim inspired Braga to their first away win against Benfica in 65 years and victory in the Taca da Liga cup final - Portugal's equivalent of the EFL Cup - against Porto.His success with limited resources convinced Sporting to make Amorim the most expensive managerial hire in Portuguese history when they paid £8.5m to extract him from his contract at Braga.Sporting's gamble paid off as Amorim guided the club to the 2020-21 league title in his first season with the club. It was their first in 19 years and they lost just once during the campaign, after the title had already been won. Despite a number of high-profile departures - including Manuel Ugarte to Paris St-Germain - Amorim guided Sporting to a second league title in four years last season. As part of his managerial training, Amorim spent time at Old Trafford in 2018 when the club was managed by compatriot Jose Mourinho. He has often been compared to Mourinho, who has also coached at Real Madrid, Chelsea and Tottenham, and is currently at Fenerbahce. Amorim met with representatives of West Ham United in April 2024 with a view to replacing David Moyes as manager.He later apologised for the trip to London, saying it was "disrespectful" and "a mistake". Chelsea expressed interest in Amorim following Mauricio Pochettino's departure at the end of last season, while Liverpool considered him as a successor for Jurgen Klopp before appointing Arne Slot.'United have focused on Amorim's style of play'BBC chief football news reporter Simon StoneAlthough Amorim likened the situation around Manchester United's managerial situation to a "soap opera", the Premier League club actually acted pretty quickly.Once it had been decided Ten Hag had to go following Sunday's 2-1 defeat at West Ham, United knew who they wanted and sent chief executive Omar Berrada to Lisbon on Monday to speak to Sporting directly.The interim period has been spent negotiating down a 30-day notice period.It quickly became obvious Amorim was not going to be in the dugout for United's Premier League game against Chelsea this weekend, which took some of the pressure off and while there was a hope Sporting may release the 39-year-old early, that did not happen either. It is thought Amorim is earning about £3m a year with Sporting. It is estimated he will more than treble his salary at United to about £10m.That puts him way behind Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola - but will move him into the Premier League's high earners.Under the circumstances, Old Trafford officials feel they have ended up with a satisfactory situation that allows Van Nistelrooy to stay in charge for another three home games.Despite reports to the contrary, United officials are adamant the club did not speak to anyone else about their vacancy, having decided Amorim fits their structure, headed up by sporting director Dan Ashworth and technical director Jason Wilcox. It completes the overhaul triggered by Sir Jim Ratcliffe's part-purchase on Christmas Eve last year.United have focused on Amorim's style of play, personality, development of young players and energy as the key characteristics that make him suited to the role, although there is no suggestion Ten Hag lacked these qualities.United feel they have recruited what club officials are calling "the most exciting young coach in Europe". Their optimism about the future has been familiar around all their previous managers post Ferguson. This appointment is the first of the Ineos era. Club officials know after all the talk, Ratcliffe will take full responsibility for what happens going forward.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, The Football News Show: Are Manchester United or Ruben Amorim taking the bigger risk?Related topicsManchester UnitedFootballMore on this storyLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan viewsGet Man Utd news notificationsPublished26 July 2022Comments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 3287Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9325 viewing9.3k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished22 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
