"Every player wants to play for Manchester United."If you look at our club in the moment, with all the problems, including changing coach, it looks a little bit of a problem."But we have a clear idea and that's the easiest part to explain for a player."Amorim refused to confirm United's interest in Cunha, who has a £62.5m release clause and is understood to be open to an Old Trafford switch.The former Sporting boss cited veteran midfielder Casemiro as an example of a player who has changed his mind about their long-term future at the club.The Brazil midfielder, 33, has a year left on his deal and recently said he would like to stay at Old Trafford.And Amorim said United's plans for next season's squad are starting to take shape."It is a conversation for the end of the season and things can change," he said."But we want to do things early and we have an idea."Related topicsManchester UnitedFootballMore on this storyLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan viewsGet Man Utd news notificationsPublished26 July 2022Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions10340 viewing10k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished25 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
