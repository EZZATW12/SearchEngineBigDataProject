"She knows how I have helped her and supported her publicly."I can't accept it [the apology] but I also want to move on from it. I don't need any further social commentary directed at anyone."Wright has long been an advocate for women's football, on which he has worked regularly as a pundit, with particular focus on Lionesses matches.In her interview with BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour on Wednesday, Aluko - who has worked alongside Wright as a pundit - said he needed to be aware of how much he works in the women's game as there are only a "finite amount of opportunities" for women.The former Chelsea player, 38, has faced scrutiny for her comments.She apologised on Instagram on Friday, saying: "Ian Wright is a brilliant broadcaster and role model whose support for the women's game has been significant."In my interview with Woman's Hour this week, I was trying to make a broader point about the limited opportunities for women in football - whether that's in coaching, broadcasting or commercial spaces - and the importance of creating more space for women to thrive on and off the pitch."But it was wrong for Ian's name to be raised in that conversation, and for that I sincerely apologise. I've known and worked with Ian for many years and have nothing but love and respect for him."Wright thanked the public for their comments of support towards him, but said more needs to be done to help the women's game grow. "Because of the past, where men blocked the women's game for 50 years, the game has serious systemic challenges and it is going to take everyone to help fix it," he added."We are the country that invented modern football so we have a responsibility to lead the way in women's football."For me, I will always give back to the game. It has given me so much."It has never bothered me about who is playing the game, as long as they are playing the game. If you know my story, you know how much football means to me."Related topicsFootballMore on this storyListen to the latest Football Daily podcastGet football news sent straight to your phonePublished31 JanuaryTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8944 viewing8.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
