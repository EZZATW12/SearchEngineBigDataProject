I am told the FA report in particular has missing pages and appears with a large number of redactions, whole pages."She later added: "The scope of this inquest is very much a work in progress. The family wants some transparency."However, coroner Sophie Cartwright said that disclosure had been made under "the Worcestershire principle", which permits redactions according to matters such as relevance.Ms Cartwright added that while she was given "full, unfettered access", both the FA and Sheffield United had sought redactions before onward disclosure, and she had considered additional ones necessary.Legal representatives for both the FA and Sheffield United said they had acted in accordance with those principles.However, Ms Cartwright did issue an apology to the Cusack family for the length of time it had taken to collate the disclosure bundle, which extends to more than 700 pages and was sent to them earlier this week."I apologise to the family, you have been waiting a long time for disclosure that is important to you," she said.Shortly after Cusack's death, her family complained about "processes and conduct" at Sheffield United, including the conduct of former women's team manager Jonathan Morgan.An investigation commissioned by the club found no evidence of wrongdoing.But the FA launched its own investigation to establish whether "further action is required under our jurisdiction within football".At a previous hearing, the FA's legal counsel said the organisation would file a report to the coroner by the middle of January. It is understood this took place.Mr Morgan attended the hearing alone, while the FA's legal counsel Stephen Walsh and head of integrity David Matthews were also present.Sheffield United's chief executive Stephen Bettis appeared remotely.A fourth pre-inquest hearing has been scheduled for 3 June. The earliest date for the inquest is late July, but the coroner indicated it might not take place until the end of the year.Related topicsFootballWomen's FootballMaddy Cusack's legacy will be 'a voice for girls'Published20 September 2024Sheff Utd 'devastated' by death of Cusack at 27Published22 September 2023More on this storyGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated pageTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions10675 viewing11k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished29 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
