Dane Sorensen, 44, joined in April 2022 and led the Toffees to sixth place in the WSL in his first full season. Everton are eighth this season, level on points with seventh-placed West Ham, and face Brighton on Sunday at 14:00 BST.Sorensen told Everton he has spoken to owners the Friedkin Group and both want "stability" and to "create consistency" at the club. Building a competitive squad is also Sorensen's main target for the summer transfer window following an injury-plagued season.Everton lost two players - Inma Gabarro and Aurora Galli - to ACL injuries in their opening two WSL games of the season, while captain Megan Finnigan suffered the same injury in January."I won't lie and say it hasn't been a bumpy time," said Sorensen."It's just we haven't basically had any consistency in the three years I've been here. I don't know how many times we've been able to put the same team out back to back - if ever, to be honest."Sorensen suggested Everton would not be able to compete financially with the division's top clubs, but that consistency around player selection could help them move up the WSL table."It's not like financially we're just going to close the gap to the top four, or I'll say five, six, seventh almost, with what some of the teams are spending," he said.He added "consistency in players and player selections" would make "the results come" and bring them "even closer to the top four".Head here to get involvedRelated topicsFootballWomen's FootballMore on this storyGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated pageTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions10675 viewing11k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished29 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
