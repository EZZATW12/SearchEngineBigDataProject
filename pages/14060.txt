There was one week in particular that I just hit a brick wall," she added."I made my Championship debut with Coventry, a couple of days later I made my debut with Wales in the senior squad. I remember flying home and it just felt like everything crashed around me."I couldn't function, I couldn't speak, I couldn't regulate my temperature."I remember sitting on my bed crying and my mum came in and said 'what's happening?'. The first thing I said was 'I need help'."I was being so hard on myself and struggling with simple daily activities. I said 'I think there's something wrong with me' but now I look at it, there was nothing wrong with me, it was just the way my brain worked."How it stands after second block of Women's Nations League matchesPublished8 AprilWales international Wynne suffers fresh ACL injuryPublished5 days agoWales keeper O'Sullivan-Jones ruled out of EurosPublished17 AprilMiddleton-Patel has featured just once for Manchester United this season, with her sole appearance for Marc Skinner's side this term coming in the League Cup.She recently made her third international start, producing a string of vital saves as Wales earned a highly-impressive 1-1 draw with Sweden in Gothenburg in the Nations League.The 21-year-old is now vying for selection at the upcoming Euro 2025 tournament in Switzerland, where Rhian Wilkinson's Wales face Netherlands, France and defending champions England in the group stage.And Middleton-Patel says she is relishing locking horns with neighbours England this summer."I'm just happy. I am excited but I don't want to get too excited," added Middleton-Patel."I'm trying to keep cool, but I'm just so proud to be Welsh. "When we got that draw, we were all ecstatic.
