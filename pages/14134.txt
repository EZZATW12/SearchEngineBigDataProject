I was watching it myself and it was just unbelievable," Bradley told BBC Sport NI."I'm really proud of him and I'm sure everyone back home has the same feeling."Bradley is available again for Liverpool after a spell out because of injury and is set to help the Anfield giants complete their Premier League triumph in the coming weeks. "It's been a frustrating year for me with injuries but I'm really happy to be back with the team and hopefully help bring the Premier League home," he added."It would be pretty special to do that especially since I've supported Liverpool all my life."
