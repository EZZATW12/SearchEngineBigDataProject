It started 132 years agoCeltic's first Scottish league title came in 1893, when the side managed by Willie Maley finished a point ahead of Rangers and scored an impressive 4.31 goals per match.4 - Rangers catch upRangers caught up with Celtic's four titles in 1901 and overtook them the following season, with their city rivals runners-up on both occasions.Celtic were level again when they won their fifth title in 1905 - the first of six in a row.Rangers would not level again until their 18th title in 1930, but since overtaking Celtic the following season, they have remained ahead - until now.9 - In a rowImage source, SNSImage caption, Jock Stein (left) won the title 10 times as Celtic managerCeltic ended a 12-year spell - their longest ever - without a league title in 1966, when they lifted the trophy for the 21st time in Jock Stein's first season as manager.They would go on to win it nine years in a row under the legendary boss.Rangers ended Celtic's dominance in 1975 as Stein's ageing side slipped to third behind Hibernian.Celtic, under Wim Jansen, prevented Rangers breaking that nine-in-a-row record in 1998.Meanwhile, Steven Gerrard's Rangers also denied Celtic a 10th consecutive title in 2021.11 - No bucking RodgersRodgers has now won the Scottish title in each of his four seasons at Celtic.Indeed, he has now won 11 of the 12 domestic trophies in which his side have competed during that time - the only miss being last season's League Cup, won by Rangers.Only Aberdeen - in the Scottish Cup final - can prevent Rodgers becoming the first Celtic manager to win three domestic trebles.11-0Celtic's 11-0 win over Dundee on 26 October 1895 remains the largest top-flight home victory.In a time before substitutes, the visitors had three players injured and played the second half with nine men, although by then they were already 5-0 behind.Maley's team would go on to win the title by four points from Rangers.16 - Beaten by StruthMaley's 16 league titles - between 1897 and 1938 - are the most won by a Celtic manager, but Bill Struth surpassed that for Rangers with 18 between 1920 and 1953.Meanwhile, Rangers outside-right Sandy Archibald's 13 title-winning medals during his 17 seasons with the Ibrox club between 1917 and 1934 remain the most for any player.16+9 - Maeda out in frontCeltic's Daizen Maeda is the Premiership's top scorer this season, despite playing mainly on the wing until fellow Japan forward Kyogo Furuhashi was sold to Rennes during the January transfer window.The 27-year-old has 16 goals from 30 appearances - one ahead of Dundee striker Simon Murray, who has played three games more.Maeda also lead the assists table, his two against Dundee United in their title-clinching win at Tannadice, equal on nine along with team-mate Alistair Johnston.21 - Since last non-Old Firm winnerSince Aberdeen won it for the fourth time in their history in 1985 - under Alex Ferguson - only Celtic (22 times) and Rangers (17 times) have secured the Scottish title.25 - O'Neill streakImage source, SNSImage caption, Martin O'Neill (left) won the Scottish Premier League three times with CelticCeltic enjoyed the most consecutive top-flight victories in history as Martin O'Neill's side went on a 25-game streak that helped win the title in 2003–04.55 -

Chasing 'Invincibles'Celtic have so far scored 102 league goals this season - just four short of Rodgers' unbeaten 'Invincibles' team that won the title in 2016-17.They have scored in 31 of their 34 games and have hit three or more in 23 of them.120 - Second in worldCeltic's 55th league title, added to 42 Scottish Cups, 22 League Cups and one European Cup, takes their total of major trophies to 120 - now two more than Rangers.However, that is only second in the world, with Egyptian club Al-Ahly amassing 125.128 - Long stayCeltic have spent a record 128 years in Scotland's top flight - four ahead of Rangers, with Heart of Midlothian third with 122.The Parkhead club's run is also in successive seasons, with Aberdeen second in those standings with 113.410 - McGrory goalsScotland centre-forward Jimmy McGrory scored a record 410 goals in almost as many games - 397 for Celtic and 13 for Clydebank - between 1922 and 1937.That is more than 100 clear of than the second best, Bob McPhail for Airdrieonians and Rangers between 1923 and 1940.McGrory also scored the most goals in a single top-flight game - eight as Celtic thrashed visitors Dunfermline Athletic 9-0 on 14 January 1928.His 48 top-flight hat-tricks also remain a record.1,256 - Forster minutesImage source, SNSImage caption, Fraser Forster (right) was a clean sheet hero for CelticTottenham Hotspur goalkeeper Fraser Forster went a record 1,256 minutes without conceding a league goal for Celtic during 2013–14.Kasper Schmeichel, who is currently injured, has had 19 Premiership clean sheets this season - seven ahead of Dundee United's Jack Walton.Overall, Celtic have kept a clean sheet in 21 of their 34 games.118,567 - At IbroxCeltic fans helped pack a crowd of 118,567 - a record for a league game in the UK -
