And, in the end, it was done at something of a canter. There were signs earlier in the campaign that Brendan Rodgers' men would take some stopping. Christmas came and went with the concession of just four points, a consistency no one else could come close to matching.  Here, BBC Scotland takes a look back at the key matches that sign-posted the inevitable.Celtic thrash Dundee Utd to clinch 13th title in 14 seasonsCeltic's Scottish league dominance in numbersPublished1 day agoLatest Celtic news, analysis & fan viewsCeltic 3-0 Rangers - 1 Sept Image source, SNSImage caption, Kyogo's strike put Celtic 2-0 up in the opening Old Firm derbyThe first derby between Scotland's big two often lays down a marker for the season to come. It's now been first blood to Celtic for the past three seasons in a row, even if Rangers won the subsequent two league meetings.  A big question was being asked of Philippe Clement's side even that early in the campaign: would there be a meaningful title race this time around?   The home side were two goals up inside 40 minutes thanks to the scourges of Rangers, Daizen Maeda and his Japanese compatriot Kyogo Furuhashi.   When captain Callum McGregor lashed in a third, it felt like a big statement of intent from the reigning champions, who were already five points clear of their old rivals after just four games.Ross County 1-2 Celtic - 6 OctWhat's this, you say? An away win in Dingwall significant to title success? It certainly felt like it at the time, as it again provided proof of the reserves of resilience this Celtic side has built up. There was also the juxtaposition of Rodgers' worst result of the season by a mile since the trip north came just a few days after Borussia Dortmund hit Celtic for seven in Germany.How would they respond? By going in at half-time a goal down to Ronan Hale's retaken penalty.   There were a fair few nerves among the travelling support, who had to wait until the 76th minute for Alistair Johnston's somewhat fortunate equaliser before Nicolas Kuhn claimed all three points with a fine winner in the dying minutes.   Aberdeen 0-1 Celtic - 4 DecThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Highlights: Aberdeen 0-1 CelticThis was the day Celtic separated themselves at the top.  Jimmy Thelin's Aberdeen had been hanging on to the champions' coattails with their own marvellous run, which included a 2-2 draw at Celtic Park.Going into the game under the Pittodrie lights, the hosts were still within four points of the Glasgow side. Until they weren't.A pass over the Aberdeen defence from the left boot of Greg Taylor was taken on the chest by Reo Hatate before the most assured of first-time finishes. It was the only moment of real quality in a tense match.   People were starting to say the league was won, with advent calendars barely opened.Celtic 3-0 St Mirren - 5 JanAgain, your eyebrows are raised at this one, aren't they? A routine win at home to St Mirren crucial to the title run-in? Context is everything...A double from Kuhn helped Celtic to an important bounce-back win after they had just been thumped 3-0 at Ibrox.This victory, in which Auston Trusty was also on the mark before half-time, not only got then back to winning ways but was psychologically significant as well.   Not for the first, or last, time this season, Rangers were unable to build on their good work of the week before. Two more points were spilled at Easter Road and that allowed Celtic to restore their advantage to 13 points.   If there had been any minor lingering doubts about the destination of the Premiership trophy, they were extinguished here.   Celtic would go on to win five of their next six league games - drawing the other one at Dundee - putting further daylight between them and the rest.Celtic 5-1 Kilmarnock - 12 AprilImage source, SNSAlmost there...  After a hugely unexpected defeat at rock-bottom St Johnstone, Celtic no longer had the chance to seal the trophy at home before the split. With Rodgers' grumbles ringing in their ears, Celtic responded in style and put four past Kilmarnock in the opening half hour.Hatate and Cameron Carter-Vickers both scored beauties from distance. Hatate completed his double, Maeda took his season's goal tally to 31 and Anthony Ralston completed the rout.Then it was all eyes on Rangers the following day. Defeat for the Ibrox side at Pittodrie would confirm Celtic as champions, but the visitors clawed their way back from 2-0 down with 10 men to find a last-gasp leveller.That left Celtic 15 points clear with 15 to play for...Dundee Utd 0-5 Celtic  - 26 AprilRodgers' side only needed a point but took all three with a rampant performance.After a slow start, it taking half an hour before a Ryan Strain own goal put them ahead, Celtic were 3-0 up at the break thanks to a Kuhn double.The travelling fans were already celebrating in the Tannadice stands before Adam Idah scored twice early in the second half to heighten the joy among those in green and white.Related topicsScottish PremiershipCelticScottish FootballFootballTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions10747 viewing11k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished34 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Scottish sportWhat is still to be decided as season reaches climax?League reconstruction - why, when & what might it look like?Scotland men's internationals to be shown live on BBCCommonwealth Games: Why is it so special to be part of Team Scotland?From titles to tinpottery - rank Scotland's top 10 clubsElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
