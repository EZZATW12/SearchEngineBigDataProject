These are the people you are dealing with. They closed the scales off early," said Eubank."I asked to go and urinate but they said no. These are tactics people use to try and get under your skin, to try and derail you from the task at hand, which is to go out there and win."They had an agenda - they wanted that money," he added.The British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC) set the rules for the weight cut and oversaw the official weigh-in on Friday morning, which was also attended by representatives from Matchroom, Eubank's promoters Boxxer and Benn's trainer Tony Simms.BBC Sport has approached the BBBoC for comment."He was expecting some sympathy, but he isn't getting any sympathy from around here," said Benn.Eubank v Benn to be broadcast on BBC Radio 5 LivePublished2 days ago'My father thinks I'm a disgrace' - Eubank reveals painPublished3 days agoEubank defiant after £375,000 fine for being 0.05lb over weightPublished2 days agoBoxing's 'antihero' Eubank hopes for father reconciliationPublished3 days agoI'm not sure what I will do - Eubank on rehydration clauseThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Eubank and Benn weigh in for fight after weight dramaEubank will have to weigh in one final time at about 08:00 BST on Saturday in line with the rehydration clause.Neither Benn nor Eubank are allowed to put on more than 10lb from the 11st 6lb limit.Benn, 28, weighed 11st 2lb and is not expected to have any issues with the rehydration limit.Eubank says he is still unsure how he will approach the next 24 hours. He will be fined again if he misses the weight."This is the peculiar situation that I find myself in," said Eubank."I have to watch what I eat and drink, or I can eat and drink whatever I want but then I have to get in the sauna tomorrow morning and sweat off 4lb - I still don't know which one I'm going to do."Benn is coming up two weight classes to fight Eubank.The pair will fight three decades after their fathers' rivalry in the 1990s and two and a half years since Benn's failed drug tests led to the cancellation of their 2022 bout.Benn has always denied intentionally doping and had his suspension lifted in November 2024.Despite Friday's hefty fine, Eubank said the only victory to celebrate will be when his "arm is raised"."If they want to look at this as their victory then that's great for them," he added."All that matters for me is who performs on the night, who puts in on the line and who represents their family name to the best of their ability."More on Eubank v Benn5 Live Boxing with Bunce podcast from Eubank v Benn fight weekEddie and Barry HearnProfiling the fightersRelated topicsBoxingBoxing schedule and results 2025Published1 day agoWatch every Born to Brawl episodePublished28 April 2024More boxing from the BBCNotifications, social media and more with BBC SportPublished31 JanuaryTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9833 viewing9.8k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished34 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
