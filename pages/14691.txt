I expected the crowd to be good but they were another level," Yee told BBC Sport."I am so proud to have completed the marathon."An amazing experience but it was hard at the end. Emotions about [the] time will come afterwards, but the main thing for me today was to enjoy it, do something unknown and embrace it. I did that to my best of my ability."This is bigger than running. It's an amazing day and I wanted to be a part of it. This was the perfect opportunity."Asked how running a marathon compared to a triathlon, he added: "My legs have never been this sore. Physically they are quite similar but my legs have never felt like this in my whole life. It's a new experience definitely."Yee confirmed that the switch to the marathon would "definitely not" be a permanent one as he plans to try and defend his Olympic title in Los Angeles in 2028."Definitely a lot more dark moments, I'd say, than Paris, today," he said."Once I got to 32, 33k there's a lot of pain there. My legs are cramping and I just had to keep fighting through that."Assefa sets women's record as Sawe wins men's racePublished1 day agoDebrunner and Hug win London wheelchair races againPublished1 day agoLondon Marathon breaks world record for most finishersPublished16 hours ago'Definitely more marathons in future' for McColganImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Eilish McColgan beat Steph Twell's previous Scottish marathon record of 2:26:40Eilish McColgan also made her marathon debut after injury had prevented her running in London in previous years.The Commonwealth 10,000m champion secured the highest finish among British runners in the elite women's race in eighth, and clocked a Scottish marathon record of 2:24:25.In doing so, she also beat the personal best of her mother - 1996 London Marathon winner Liz McColgan - who ran 2:26:52 in 1997."I was very, very nervous. Probably the most nervous I have been," the 34-year-old told BBC Sport."The distance was an unknown. I have never raced more than a half marathon so the thought of doing it back-to-back was scary. The crowds were insane."I knew my first [marathon] would be tough. I was coming in underprepared. I can now call myself a marathoner which I was incredibly proud of. It was a really good learning experience."I would love to break two minutes 20 seconds. It is what I think I am capable of doing. I will make some tweaks in training."There will definitely be more marathons in the future. Hopefully there can another before the end of the year."McColgan finished a place above fellow Briton Rose Harvey with Phily Bowden in 11th and Holly Archer 13th.Related topicsAthleticsTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9804 viewing9.8k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished35 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
