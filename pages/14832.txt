There has been no official word from Ancelotti or Real Madrid that he will depart the club next year.The 64-year-old began his second spell at the Bernabeu in 2021, after leaving Everton, and has won the Champions League, La Liga, a Copa del Rey and the Club World Cup among a string of successes since his return.The Champions League final win against Liverpool in 2022 was Ancelotti's fourth European triumph as a manager, and second with Real Madrid, after also winning the competition twice with AC Milan.Image source, BBC SportOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a momentImage source, BBC SportRelated topicsBrazilReal MadridFootballTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions10559 viewing11k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished38 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
