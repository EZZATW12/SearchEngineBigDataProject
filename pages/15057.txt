He came agonisingly close to a century on three separate occasions as he made 98 in frame eight, 89 in frame 10 and 97 in frame 12.But successive centuries, 106 in frame 14 and 132 in frame 15, with what BBC commentator John Virgo called "a masterclass in break building", took Trump to the feat, much to the delight of a packed Crucible crowd.He marked the achievement with a fist pump and a smile after initial relief, while he got a standing ovation from the fans with Murphy joining in the applause.Australian Neil Robertson made 103 centuries in 2013-14, while Trump is the only other person to get to 100 with his 102 in 2019-20.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, If Judd Trump beats Shaun Murphy in the last 16, he will play either Luca Brecel or Ding Junhui in the quarter-finalsAfter his 10-4 win over Zhou Yuelong in the first round, Trump - then on 98 centuries - was asked what an achievement it would be to get to 100.He said: "It would be way better than the achievement last time because I played far more tournaments and far more games [in 2019-20]."I don't know how many games I played this season, but it would have to be a record as I've missed three or four tournaments."I didn't target it at all, I didn't think it was a possibility. I didn't want to be in contention but after the Championship League, I didn't expect the pockets to be so big, and the centuries were flying in for everyone."Trump, the 2019 world champion, leads 10-6 over Murphy and needs three more frames to move into the quarter-finals when the match is played to a finish from 13:00 BST on Monday.The overall champion will get £500,000 in prize money.O'Sullivan & Brecel one frame each from last eightPublished18 hours agoAll the updates from day nine of the World ChampionshipWorld Championship: Schedule, results & BBC coveragePublished13 hours ago'Playing better than he's ever played'Image source, Picture courtesy of WSTImage caption, Referee Rob Spencer congratulated Judd Trump after the achievementJohn Parrott, the 1991 world champion, called Trump's performance "snooker from the gods" and added: "That is some achievement. You can't play better than this. Those two frames were of the highest order."Seven-time world champion Stephen Hendry agreed and added: "Judd Trump is world number one, he's had seasons where he's won six ranking tournaments, but I think he's playing better than he's ever played at the moment."He came into the World Championship having lost a final to Kyren Wilson at the Players Championship and lost in the first round of the Tour Championship, so he came into it with not the success he's been having."But he was obviously able to go away for three or four weeks, put in some practice, recharge and he's come back - he's just getting better and it's the best I've seen him playing."Most century breaks in one seasonNeil Robertson (2013-14) 103Judd Trump (2019-20) 102Judd Trump (2024-25) 100Judd Trump (2020-21) 90Neil Robertson (2018-19) 84Judd Trump (2018-19) 83Judd Trump (2014-15) 82Judd Trump (2023-24) 79Ronnie O'Sullivan (2017-18) and Kyren Wilson (2020-21) both 74'Wonderful break building' - fans views on social mediaImage source, Picture courtesy of WSTImage caption, Trump's opponent Shaun Murphy joined in with the applauseAlistair: What a special player. Congrats on 100.James: Great stuff Judd Trump. 100 tons for £100k!Joseph: Take a bow, Judd Trump. Wonderful break building. A century of century breaks in a single season. And he makes the 100th at the Crucible.Connor: Criminal that Judd Trump has only ever won a single World Championship. A man of his quality should have three or four to his name at the very least. Exceptional player.Patrick: A century of centuries for Judd Trump in a season, a £100,000 bonus and to complete it at the Theatre of Dreams makes it that extra special.Related topicsSnookerTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions10156 viewing10k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished13 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
