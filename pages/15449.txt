meetingsSkip back to form guideSkip back to season so farMatch FactsScroll LeftScroll RightFollowing their 4-0 win at Portman Road in December, Newcastle are looking to complete their first league double over Ipswich since 1973-74.Ipswich are winless in their last 11 away league games against Newcastle (D5 L6). This is their first game against them at St James’ Park since October 2016 (0-3 in the Championship), and first in the Premier League since March 2002 (2-2).Newcastle United have won each of their last four Premier League games at St. James’ Park, scoring 4+ goals in the last two of those. The Mapgies have only ever scored four or more in three successive Premier League home matches once before, doing so in August/September 1994.If Ipswich fail to win (or West Ham avoid defeat vs Brighton), their relegation back to the Championship will be confirmed. It would be the first time in Premier League history that all relegations are confirmed with as many as four games to go, and the second time all three have happened before May after 2005-06.Despite being just one of five teams to score at least 60 Premier League goals this season, Newcastle have had just nine different goalscorers (excluding own goals). The Magpies had the most different scorers in the competition last term (20).Ipswich have had fewer than five shots in five different Premier League games this season, including their 4-0 defeat to Arsenal last time out (4). Only Leicester (6) have done so in more games than the Tractor Boys this term.Newcastle United have conceded the first shot they have faced in 10 Premier League matches this season (excluding own goals), the second-most on record (from 2006-07) by any side in a single campaign in the competition, after Aston Villa in 2022-23 (11 times).Ipswich have dropped a league-high 27 points from winning positions in the Premier League this season, while Newcastle have lost a league-low seven points when ahead this term.Jacob Murphy has been involved in six goals in his last five Premier League games for Newcastle (3 goals, 3 assists). Meanwhile, 41% of his overall Premier League goal involvements have come this season (19/46 – 8 goals, 11 assists).Newcastle’s Alexander Isak has scored 15 goals in his 14 Premier League appearances against promoted sides, including a hat-trick against Ipswich in this season’s reverse fixture.Live TextPostat 90 minutes plus 590'+5Match ends, Newcastle United 3, Ipswich Town 0.Full Timeat 90 minutes plus 590'+5Second Half ends, Newcastle United 3, Ipswich Town 0.Postat 90 minutes plus 590'+5Offside, Newcastle United.
