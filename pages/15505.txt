It's going to be exciting, the first six rounds will be explosive.''Retired world champion Tony Bellew: ''I think Conor Benn will get to Eubank. If he does get through those first five or six rounds, he's took what Conor's got and he starts unloading himself. It's a fight of two halves. Neither's defence is that good and both of them want to get at to each other, bad.''Retired world champion Barry Jones: "I think Eubank wins on points. Benn might be able to tough it out as he is a tough kid, but I don't know if he has the ability. Eubank can't make middleweight no more, it drains him and he beat an old Liam Smith in their rematch. But he's a massive guy, so if he's able to rehydrate correctly, he is just too fast and too big."Heavyweight Fabio Wardley: "My initial feeling is Eubank will get the win. The weight factor will play quite a big part, asking Benn to come up two weights is a lot against someone who is naturally comfortable fighting at that weight. Benn can carry some strong power at his weight, but there is a large difference when those punches which you hit in your previous weight would take them out, but a bigger guy is more used to taking bigger shots and they don't have the same effect."Scotland's first female world champion Hannah Rankin: "I think it will be a later-round stoppage from Eubank. Experience and size is in his favour. I will be very surprised if Benn gets the win. Eubank is stronger. He's been in there with solid opponents that have tested his chin. I'm surprised how many people see this as a 50-50."Unbeaten light-welterweight Adam Azim: "Benn to knock him out. He's the younger fighter, very powerful. Eubank's last performance wasn't the greatest."Chris Eubank Jr v Conor BennSaturday, 26 AprilTottenham Hotspur StadiumListen on SoundsLive text and radio commentary from 19:00 BST on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app before switching to BBC Radio 5 Live at 21:30
Middleweight Hamzah Sheeraz: "I think Benn is going to win. I want Eubank to win for selfish reasons and wanting to fight him in the future, but I feel like Benn will do the job."Heavyweight Delicious Orie: "I see Eubank doing the job. It will be a great fight but Eubank edges it. He has the experience and weight advantage. I think he's probably got into Benn's head a little bit as well in the press conferences. It's more than just about the physicality of it, it's about the mental side too." Scotland's former undisputed light-welterweight world champion Josh Taylor: "Eubank is the naturally bigger and more experienced opponent but Benn is a young, hungry lion. He has the advantage of not having to cut weight and to be able to get bigger and stronger. He also has youth on his side. But my head is going with Eubank." Benn's promoter Eddie Hearn: "Benn has to start fast in this fight, he has to land and he has to hurt him early and get his respect and, quite frankly, get him out of there. I think we need him out in six rounds. He lands early, clean and cold, and I believe Eubank is stopped."Light-heavyweight Lyndon Arthur: "I think Benn's going to come out and he might shock Eubank. He could get caught coming in though."Cruiserweight Cheavon Clarke: "I'm on the fence. Maybe a draw."Former light-middleweight world champion Liam Smith: "I find it hard to pick a winner, I won't be surprised with either result. I do edge towards Benn winning on points."Eubank's promoter Ben Shalom: "I think Eubank wins by knockout. It will be a frantic first two or three rounds and then it will calm down and Eubank will take over. A knockout in round six."This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Fighting Benn is 10 times bigger now - EubankBritish heavyweight Derek Chisora: "The smart money is on Eubank. He had fights when Benn was on holiday. But I'm friends with Benn, he comes to my house so my money is on him. I'm 50-50 but I'll go with Benn because I want him to win because of his family and legacy."Former cruiserweight world champion Johnny Nelson: "I'm saying Eubank because he had more consistency in his career. Benn's style is so ferocious and attacking, that should suit Eubank in the first six rounds."Light-heavyweight Anthony Yarde: "If Benn wins it is because he goes in with controlled aggression and detonates when he needs to. If Benn hurts Eubank then he is good at finishing. If Eubank wins then it's being himself but an aggressive version of himself. He needs to be switched on - the version we saw in his second fight against Liam Smith. Eubank is a world-class operator and he has shown that."Eubank Sr's former promoter Barry Hearn: "I think this is a 50-50 fight - of course I'm on Conor's side, but I'm not going to ignore that the other man is a much bigger man with more experience. It is going to be something awesome. I think Nigel will have Conor ready for war but in a more controlled way."Super-bantamweight Francesca Hennessy: "They're both great fighters. I've been going back and forth. Eubank is bigger at the weight but Benn is strong and will come forward. I keep changing my mind."This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, An inside look at Conor Benn's training camp in MallorcaRelated topicsBoxingBoxing schedule and results 2025Published1 day agoWatch every Born to Brawl episodePublished28 April 2024More boxing from the BBCNotifications, social media and more with BBC SportPublished31 JanuaryTop storiesLive. Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win - latest & reaction10224 viewing10k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published15 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished45 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
