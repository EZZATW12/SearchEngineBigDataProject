"I have a brother who is buried in the desert in Dubai - that is pain."I have his son, three years old, he asks: 'Why can't I see my daddy? Why can't he take me to school?' That is pain."It is becoming increasingly unlikely Chris Eubank Sr, who beat Nigel Benn in 1990 before a contentious draw three years later, will be at Saturday's bout.Eubank Sr has fallen out with his son and not been involved in any of the fight build-up."My own father, a man I idolised for my entire life, and he doesn't speak to me," added Eubank Jr."We haven't spoken for years and he thinks I'm a disgrace. These things are what pain is to me."Eubank Jr and Benn were scheduled to fight in October 2022, before Benn failed a voluntary drugs test.A long and intense stare down ensued at the face-off, although there was no repeat of February's infamous news conference when Eubank Jr slapped Benn with an egg.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Fighting Benn is ten times bigger now - EubankEubank v Benn to be broadcast on BBC Radio 5 LivePublished2 days agoHow 'nepo kid' Benn has prepared for Eubank fightPublished5 days agoInherited rivalry to bona fide hatred - 934 days of Eubank-Benn carnagePublished6 days agoHearn heckled & Benn accused of 'fleeing' UKImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Eddie Hearn has promoted Conor Benn for his entire professional careerEubank Jr took his seat 15 minutes after the scheduled start time, leaving Benn and a few hundred of the boxing media waiting in a conference room overlooking the pitch at the fight night venue.Just like he did in February, Eubank Jr heckled promoter Eddie Hearn the moment the Matchroom boss began to speak."I can't wait for him to smash you to pieces on Saturday," Hearn said, raising his voice to be heard.Hearn swapped places with Matchroom chief executive Frank Smith, but Eubank Jr did not back down.He then accused Benn, who based his training camp in Spain, of "fleeing" the United Kingdom."He knew he couldn't handle the pressure of the UK streets and have people shouting drug cheat and egg jokes," added Eubank Jr.Benn, who has always maintained his innocence, had his suspension lifted in November after a two-year-battle with anti-doping authorities.With his father sat beside him, he refused to bite back and felt "no pressure" in a bid to extend his 23-fight unbeaten record.Nigel Benn on son's sparring surpriseThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch Benn train for Eubank fightFormer world-title challenger Eubank Jr has won 34 fights and lost three, but competed at a much higher level than his opponent.Benn has operated the majority of his career two divisions below the middleweight limit.Both fighters will weigh in on Friday and are prohibited from adding more than 10lbs by a second weigh-in on Saturday morning.Eubank Jr remains favourite with bookmakers, but those in Benn's inner circle say he looks in phenomenal shape.Nigel Benn, as he has done throughout camp and in every media event, was by his son's side and predicted the fight "won't go past four rounds".He raved about his son "bullying" sparring partners as he spoke of a session in which Benn supposedly got the better of undefeated IBF world super-middleweight champion William Scull, who fights Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez on 4 May."He couldn't take no more after eight rounds, he was meant to be doing 10 rounds," added the 61-year-old former two-weight world champion.Whether where is any truth to all the noise, or if it's just smoke and mirrors and the usual pre-fight hype, remains to be seen.What information do we collect from this quiz?Related topicsBoxing5 Live Boxing with Bunce from fight weekBarry & Eddie HearnProfiling the fightersFight week beginsBoxing schedule and results 2025Published1 day agoWatch every Born to Brawl episodePublished28 April 2024More boxing from the BBCNotifications, social media and more with BBC SportPublished31 JanuaryTop storiesLive. Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win - latest & reaction8924 viewing8.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published15 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished47 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
