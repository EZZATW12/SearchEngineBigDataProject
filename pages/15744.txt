The 28-year-old had his British licence revoked in 2022 by the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC) after two failed drugs tests in the lead up to his cancelled fight against Chris Eubank Jr.The suspension was lifted earlier this month, with Ukad saying the National Anti-Doping Panel was "not comfortably satisfied" it and the BBBofC had proved he had committed an anti-doping rule violation.Ukad was given 21 days to appeal but the organisation has decided against doing so.Following the decision, the BBBofC also confirmed, external it would not be lodging an appeal. The World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) has a separate period in which it can appeal.The 28-year-old, who has an unbeaten 23-0 record in the welterweight division, tested positive for women's fertility drug Clomifene.Benn, who has not fought in Britain since April 2022, has always denied doping and said he had been "cleared of any wrongdoing" when his suspension was lifted. He has fought twice since his suspension, but both fights - victories against Rodolfo Orozco in September 2023 and Peter Dobson in February 2024 - were in the United States.Benn is now free to resume his fighting career in the UK and plans to reschedule a bout with Eubank Jr.Both fighters' teams are pushing for the contest and the preference is for it to take place in the UK rather than in Saudi Arabia.Related topicsBoxingBoxing schedule and results 2024Published17 December 2024Watch every Born to Brawl episodePublished28 April 2024More boxing from the BBCNotifications, social media and more with BBC SportPublished31 JanuaryTop storiesLive. Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win - latest & reaction8924 viewing8.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published15 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished47 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
