Benn, who hit the scales at 11st 2lb on Friday, added 9lb.Eubank is the bigger of the two men and normally fights two weight classes higher than Benn, who is a natural welterweight.  Eubank, 35, and Benn, 28, meet over 30 years after their fathers' rivalry in the 1990s.The sons were scheduled to face each other in 2022 but the fight was cancelled because Benn failed a drugs test.Benn, who has denied intentional doping and has been cleared to fight by anti-doping authorities, is unbeaten in 23 pro fights.Eubank, who has won 34 and lost three, has paid more than £500,000 in fines and payments to undercard fighters before he has stepped in the ring.Both men are expected to earn a seven-figure purse for the fight.Eubank v Benn - big-fight predictionsPublished2 days agoEubank v Benn - all you need to knowPublished2 days ago'My father thinks I'm a disgrace' - Eubank reveals painPublished3 days agoWhat is a rehydration clause?This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch Eubank and Benn weigh inEubank's weight has been a major talking point in the build-up and particularly during fight week.He weighed 0.2lb over the 11st 6lb limit at the first attempt on Friday and was still too heavy the second time.The rehydration clause has been criticised by some in boxing, including Eubank’s father Chris Eubank Sr.Former undisputed light-welterweight champion Josh Taylor has said the contest should be called off. "I think this is potentially a very disastrous night for boxing waiting to happen. I desperately hope this is not the case," the Scotsman added on social media.  Benn's team feel the rehydration clause allows for a more level playing field.Fighters generally shed some fat over the period of their training camp to get close to the agreed or stipulated weight limit.Before the weigh-in, which takes place a day before the fight night, they may dehydrate to lose the final bit of weight.Losing water weight close to the fight allows them to refuel with food and water much more easily.Eubank says he would usually put on about 14lb after a weigh-in.Before the first weigh-in, he said his two options were to either put on what he usually would and then cut 4lb early on Saturday, or remain within the 10lb window.Chris Eubank Jr v Conor BennSaturday, 26 AprilTottenham Hotspur StadiumListen on SoundsLive text and radio commentary from 19:00 BST on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app before switching to BBC Radio 5 Live at 21:30
