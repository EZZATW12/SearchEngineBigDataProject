You can argue Eubank Jr deserved to win the fight, but 116-112 is ridiculous. A superb scrap though.JarListened to the Eubank jr v Benn fight on radio, and what fantastic commentary!!! Boxing works so well on radio! Expected Eubank to win on paper and love Connor Benn's attrition and perseverance! Connor Benn has done himself so much credit by battling to the enth degree!!!

I'm not going to say 'yeah I should have won that', I've got to watch it back. It was close. I stayed on the ropes maybe a bit too long and he worked harder towards the end."A massive thank you to all my supporters who came out, it was some homecoming."43249Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingStat attackpublished at 23:36 British Summer Time 26 April23:36 BST 26 AprilEubank beats Benn by unanimous decisionI've seen a fair few texts suggesting Chris Eubank Jr was handed this victory but I think that is an unfair characterisation of what we have just witnessed.Sure, Conor Benn started strongly and there were some close rounds, but the statistics don't lie.Eubank landed more punches, landed more power punches and a higher percentage of his punches thrown landed.It's difficult to argue with that, right?1614113Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingPostpublished at 23:30 British Summer Time 26 April23:30 BST 26 AprilEubank beats Benn by unanimous decisionThe seal of approval from Dustin Poirier.
