They were wearing T-shirts that said "Youth Demand: Stop Arming Israel".The Metropolitan Police said a member of the London Marathon event staff intervened to remove the protesters from the path of the men's elite race, which was able to pass unobstructed moments later.Police said the paint appeared to be "chalk-based" and was not expected to present a hazard to runners.The protesters were arrested on suspicion of causing a public nuisance and they remain in custody.Hugh Brasher, chief executive of London Marathon Events, said: "It's very disappointing that two people attempted to disrupt the London Marathon which does so much good, raises so many millions for charity, brings so much joy and brings communities together."Our staff and the police intervened immediately and the event was not impacted in any way."Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.
