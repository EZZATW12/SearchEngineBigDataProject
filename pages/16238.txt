The letter said: "Decisions against Real Madrid have reached a level of manipulation and adulteration of the competition that can no longer be ignored."Speaking at a meeting with La Liga clubs, RFEF and representatives of Spain's refereeing committee (CTA) on Thursday - which Real Madrid did not attend - Tebas said: "Real Madrid wants to harm the competition, not just the refereeing group."They have built a story of victimhood and I think the cherry on top was the letter they published the other day."The issue has been blown out of proportion, they have lost their head. Football doesn't revolve around Real Madrid."Meanwhile, earlier on Thursday, RFEF chief Rafael Louzan had his seven-year ban from holding public office overturned by Spain's Supreme Court.In 2022 a provincial court ruled against Louzan for misconduct during his tenure as president of Pontevedra Provincial Council.He was elected RFEF president in December after the Supreme Court allowed him to run."Let this be the beginning of a new, different era, we have the opportunity to create it together," said Louzan.Related topicsSpanish La LigaReal MadridFootballMore on this storyListen to the latest Football Daily podcastGet football news sent straight to your phonePublished31 JanuaryTop storiesLive. Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win - latest & reaction10888 viewing11k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published15 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished53 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
