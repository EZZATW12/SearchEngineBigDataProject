Montero has since received abuse on social media, while his family have also been targeted. "The professional referees are absolutely repulsed by the attacks and threats that our colleague Jose Luis Munuera Montero is receiving through social networks," the RFEF said in a statement. "These attacks add to the hatred and verbal violence through which we have to carry out our professional work every weekend, and that in the base categories becomes, even more regrettably, physical violence in many cases."Former Birmingham City midfielder Bellingham said his language was misconstrued by referee Montero."He believed that I said [something insulting] to him," said Bellingham. "There was no intent to insult him, there was no insult, and for that reason I think you can see there was a misunderstanding."Bellingham is now facing a lengthy ban, at a time when Real Madrid have allowed a seven-point lead to slip at the top of the La Liga table.Carlo Ancelotti's side are winless in their last three league matches and are now level on points with rivals Barcelona but are second because they have an inferior goal difference.Related topicsEuropean FootballFootballBellingham 'disrespectful' after red card - FlickPublished16 FebruaryMore on this storyListen to the latest Football Daily podcastTop storiesLive. Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win - latest & reaction10888 viewing11k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published15 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished53 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
