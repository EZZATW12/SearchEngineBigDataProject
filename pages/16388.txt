"The goal was to win, but at the end it's hard to realise. I cannot be more proud of the team," said 26-year-old Pogacar.Van der Poel re-joined the peloton within just 10km of his crash and tussled with Pogacar through the hills.

In the women's race, Belgian Lotte Kopecky made history as the first cyclist to win three editions of the event. Riding for Team SD Worx, the 29-year-old claimed victory in thrilling style by winning a four-way sprint finish ahead of France's Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, Liane Lippert of Germany and Poland's Katarzyna Niewiadoma-Phinney. "It was a crazy race with a lot of crashes in the beginning," said Kopecky. "When it went with the four of us I was pretty confident."Italian rider Elisa Longo Borghini was among the favourites with Kopecky and also chasing a third Tour of Flanders title, but had to withdraw after crashing around 95km from the finish.Around 750,000 spectators gathered on the streets from Bruges to Oudenaarde for the event, which is one of five one-day races in the cycling calendar known as the Monuments.The others are Milan-San Remo, Paris-Roubaix, the Liege-Bastogne-Liege and Tour of Lombardy.On 13 April, Pogacar will be taking part on more cobbled tracks for the Paris-Roubaix race - known as 'hell of the north' - for the first time, where Van der Poel is again the defending champion."Roubaix is a completely different race, but I will accept the challenge and try to do my best," added Pogacar.Related topicsCyclingTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8793 viewing8.8k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
