Italy could finish as high as third should Ireland lose heavily to Scotland without a bonus-point. While all eyes will be on Saturday's Grand Slam showdown between England and France, there is still plenty to play for at the other end of the table.Wales bolster pack to face Italy in 6N finalePublished3 days ago'World class' Sing ready for Grand Slam deciderPublished2 days agoTeam newsWales have made three changes, all in the pack, and Lynn admits it was in response to last weekend's disappointing defeat by Ireland.Prop Donna Rose will make her first start of the campaign, replacing Jenni Scoble who had a tough time in the scrum at Rodney Parade.Gwen Crabb will look to further steady the pack from the second row, while Georgia Evans, one of Wales' few bright sparks, reverts to number eight.Vice-captain Alex Callender drops to the bench as Lynn looks to have impact players in a bid to find that elusive 80-minute performance.Kayleigh Powell is yet to recover from her hamstring injury so Lleucu George remains at fly-half.Italy too have made three changes.Sofia Stefan returns at scrum-half, while Francesca Sgorbini and Sara Tounesi are back in the Azzurre pack.Second row Tounesi partners the outstanding Giordana Duca, who along with Wales' Evans is one of the tournament's top tacklers.Francesca Granzotto and Isabella Locatelli are also named in the matchday squad, having missed the fixtures against France and Scotland while completing their academic studies.View from the campsItaly full-back Ostuni Minuzzi said: "We were disappointed with the match against Wales last year and since then we've taken a new course with a new coach."We are looking ahead to this match without thinking about what happened in the past. We've talked about last year and put that behind us and this Sunday we want to show what we are capable of."They've got some wonderful players and they've shown that they can challenge teams, so we have to be aggressive from the start. "We need to stick to our strategies if we want to get on top on the pitch and think of the collective, not about individuals."Wales captain Hannah Jones said: "We've reflected on Ireland and we're disappointed as a team that we lost by that margin."Our discipline wasn't the best, the set-piece - we're normally better in that area."Italy like to play a running game, they don't kick that often so we're definitely going to have to work hard, we have to turn up in all areas, do our individual roles to come together as a squad."We've talked about the journey and where we'd like to head going into a World Cup. I think having a win on the weekend will definitely give us confidence going to Australia [for a two-game summer tour]."We have had small wins during the campaign so it's not all doom and gloom."Commentator’s notesBBC Radio Wales commentator Nick Webb said: “After minor steps forward in patches of the England and France games, it was a step back against Ireland as Wales were out-muscled.“A better try count is little consolation if Wales are continuing to leak at the other end.“They now face an Italian side who are potent out wide, ran in five tries against Scotland and only trailed France by a point with three minutes left, only to concede twice while trying to play from deep.“The question is whether Wales' pack changes can help them find the sort of forward dominance they relied on to sneak a win at the Principality Stadium a year ago.“New coach Sean Lynn, going into the tournament with virtually no preparation, is now in real need of a result in the warmth of northern Italy, with the crucial World Cup opener against Scotland uncomfortably close in August.”Image source, Huw Evans Picture AgencyImage caption, Italy beat Wales 8-5 in their WXV2 encounter last OctoberMatch statsItaly haven't won at home in the Women's Six Nations since 2023 (v Ireland), with their last two victories both coming on the road.
