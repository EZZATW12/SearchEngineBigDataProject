So we need to be disciplined and defensively organised."Italy have made three starting changes with Sofia Stefan back at scrum-half alongside recalls for flanker Francesca Sgorbini and lock Sara Tounesi.Italy: Vittoria Ostuni Minuzzi; Aura Muzzo, Michela Sillari, Sara Mannini, Alyssa D'Incá; Veronica Madia, Sofia Stefan; Silvia Turani, Vittoria Vecchini, Sara Tounesi, Giordana Duca, Beatrice Veronese, Francesca Sgorbini, Elisa Giordano (capt).Replacements: Desiree Spinelli, Emanuela Stecca, Gaia Maris, Isabella Locatelli, Alissa Ranuccini, Alia Bitonci, Beatrice Rigoni, Francesca Granzotto.Wales: Jasmine Joyce-Butchers; Lisa Neumann, Hannah Jones (capt), Courtney Keight, Carys Cox; Lleucu George, Keira Bevan; Gwenllian Pyrs, Kelsey Jones, Donna Rose, Abbie Fleming, Gwen Crabb, Kate Williams, Bethan Lewis, Georgia Evans.Replacements: Carys Phillips, Maisie Davies, Jenni Scoble, Natalia John, Alex Callender, Sian Jones, Hannah Bluck, Catherine Richards.Italy: TBCReferee: Sara Cox (England).Assistant referees: Maria Latos (Germany) & Alexandra Ferré (France)TMO: Andrew McMenemy (Scotland)Related topicsWelsh RugbyWales SportRugby UnionComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 22Top storiesLive. Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win - latest & reaction10612 viewing11k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published15 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished57 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
