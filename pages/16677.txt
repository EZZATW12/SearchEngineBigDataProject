Of course they all want to know who will be their line manager."I've already spoken to the potential new director of rugby about these things and we'd like to appoint a new head coach shortly after that."But depending on their contract and notice period, which is often six months, we might need to have an alternative [coaching] plan for Japan, which we are working on."Related topicsWelsh RugbyRugby UnionTop storiesLive. Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win - latest & reaction11110 viewing11k viewingLive. World Snooker Championship - live text6370 viewing6.4k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published15 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
