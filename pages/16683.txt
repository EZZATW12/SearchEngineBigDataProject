The ball was recycled infield and some weak tackling allowed Djougang to power over from close range.Wales continued to live dangerously and were made to pay again when Ireland's forwards piled on the pressure, and this time it was Wafer celebrating. The hosts were boosted when influential fly-half Dannah O'Brien was sent to the sin bin for making shoulder to head contact against a charging Alex Callender, but it was Ireland who looked like they had a player advantage.The defence had initially done well to hold Edel McMahon up over the line but the Irish kept coming, with Wall crashing over as Wales once again conceded on the stroke of half-time.Women's Six Nations: Wales 14-40 Ireland - reaction and as it happenedWomen's Six Nations: Fixtures, results & BBC coveragePublished2 hours agoThe first score after the break was always going to be crucial for any hopes of a Welsh comeback, but the Irish set piece once again proved a weapon and Wall was soon in for her second and her side's bonus point.Jasmine Joyce-Butchers and Cox attempted to spark a resurgence down the wing, but Wales were guilty of not looking after the ball.Hannah Jones also made a promising break, but the pass out wide fell straight into Irish hands as Wales paid for their inaccuracy.Ireland, in contrast, looked like the fifth best team in the world, a team who had beaten New Zealand in the autumn, as they sent wave after wave of attacks into a tiring defence.The fifth try came after the driving lineout was initially repelled, but with forwards queueing up it was the powerful prop Djougang who crossed again. Cox continued to pose a threat, while George put Wales in a promising attack with a 50-22 which set up Bluck's try.Carys Phillips took the long throw before powering up to the line, Keira Bevan kept the ball among the forwards before freeing Bluck who backed her pace through a tight gap. It was Bluck's first involvement in the campaign.Wales had not long finished celebrating when Wafer went straight back up the other end of the pitch and silenced the crowd. The number eight picked up from the back of the Irish scrum and bulldozed her way through Cox, who had too much space to cover on the blindside.With Wales staring down the barrel of a record defeat to their opponents, Ireland full-back Stacey Flood spared their blushes by knocking on what would have otherwise been a run-in.Still, it was another sobering defeat for Wales.Wales head coach Sean Lynn said: "I feel really hurt, the players are hurt, the staff are hurt, but this is an Ireland side that beat New Zealand."We have got to start turning pressure into points. "On that 25 minute mark when we were on their try line, we just didn't, and a side who are at the top of the championship go up the other end make it 7-7 where it could have been 14-0."When we're in the moment we've got to make sure that we're nailing it."Ireland back row Aoife Wafer said: "We speak about being the most connected team in the world. I think that shows on the pitch, but it's not only the 15 out there or 23, we've girls at home who are injured and we'd love them to take to the pitch with us. We play for them as well."Winning away is tough, so to do it in Parma and Wales, the crowd were brilliant, so to quieten them down and put on our own game is something we can take from it.
