Wales flew from Bristol on Friday morning before taking a coach from Bordeaux to Brive, but a road accident and weekend traffic meant they did not reach their hotel until around 8pm.The delay saw Wales miss their team run through at Stade Amedee-Domenech with the players having 13 hours of travel in their legs ahead of a 12:45 BST Saturday kick-off."That was out of hand, we'll review it, making sure that we put plans in place, but that's what we can't control, the traffic," said Lynn."I thought we were still in a good place today, so I'm not making excuses there."I spoke to the leadership group and at the end of the day it's four white lines and the preparation has been done by these girls in the week."That will come into our Six Nations review, I'll get the player feedback and the staff feedback and that's moving forward. We've got to be making those changes."This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, ‘I asked the girls to be brave … I’m proud of them all’France beat brave Wales to remain on course for titlePublished12 AprilWales captain Hannah Jones said she was proud of the way her team mates coped against the fourth-best team in the world."The girls adapted really well, " she said."You have got to get on with it."We stopped for some food on the way, we were trying to stretch on the bus, we had massage slots in the evening."Fair play to our staff, they did everything they could to get us in the best shape, butthe flight and the times were out of our control."This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Women's Six Nations highlights: France 42-12 Wales'Better than that'Wales had gone into the game as underdogs having never won on French soil and having won only two of their last 11 Six Nations outings.But tries from Kate Williams and Gwen Crabb saw the visitors very much in the contest at half-time.Lynn admits it was the French scores either side of half-time which proved decisive."I call those the championship minutes, but the girls felt really confident going in at half-time and the coaching staff too," he said."We've got to take that as a positive because you're coming out here in front of an amazing crowd, in an amazing stadium and we are competing with France."Lynn agreed that the final scoreline did not reflect the effort of his players."I totally agree. 42-12 we are better than that, but full credit to France, the way they played and opened it up, their offloading game is typical "jeu" and it's lovely to see, but we are better than that."Wales will now go in search of their first win under Lynn when they host Ireland at Rodney Parade on Sunday, 20 April.France, meanwhile, remain on course for a Grand Slam decider against defending champions England on the final day of the championship on Saturday, 26 April.
