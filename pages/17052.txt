"It feels like it's been normalised when it really isn't," said the Northern Irishman, who is now the club's third most successful manager."It's such a hard thing to do. From the first day of pre-season right the way through until the end, we're going to push and fight to win as many trophies as we can."We wanted to raise the flag for Celtic today and we've done that. We want to also perform well and the players were outstanding in that job as well."Celtic thrash Dundee Utd to clinch 13th title in 14 seasonsWhat were the key games in Celtic's title triumph?Published1 day agoLatest Celtic news, analysis & fan views'Privileged' Rodgers still relishing 'big pressure'This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, 'Big pressure, but it's great when you have days like this'Celtic have won 43 major honours since 2000, with 11 of them under Rodgers across two spells.The former Liverpool manager claimed every domestic prize he competed for during his first stint in Scotland before his controversial move to Leicester City.That mid-season switch back to the Premier League in 2019 made his return to Celtic difficult to accept for many fans.But Rodgers has won those supporters over by leading the team to more domestic success and progression in Europe.The 52-year-old said he had "never been happier" in Glasgow and was committed to delivering more silverware next season."To be the manager here, it's a real privilege," he added. "But also I have that emotional connection as well."That's the joy of managing here. It's big pressure, big expectation, but it's great when you have days like this here."My career until now has been great. I started on a journey as a young coach and have had the privilege to manage some amazing clubs. "However, like I said, there's an emotional attachment here because of supporting the club and my family and friends."'Sky's the limit' - but how far can Celtic go?Captain Callum McGregor believes the "sky is the limit" for this team under Rodgers, but what is left for Celtic to achieve?In the short term, there is another a treble on the line when they face Aberdeen in next month's Scottish Cup final at Hampden.If that is secured, the demand will be to repeat that feat again next term while continuing to make strides in Europe.After progressing to the knockout stage of the Champions League, Celtic were seconds away from earning a seismic second-leg win at Bayern Munich, which would have taken the German giants to extra time for a place in the last 16.Although Rodgers' men will have to navigate one qualifying round next season, they will have aims to improve in Uefa's premier club competition.But before they need to focus on that, there is another domestic clean sweep to achieve."We have four league games left to try to arrive into the Scottish Cup final in the best moment," McGregor said on Sky Sports. "If we do that, we have the chance to do something special this season."He added winning trebles was "the standard and expectation we've set".Have your sayCeltic fans, we want to hear your views after Rodgers' side wrapped up another league title.Where does this title rank for you?
