a former two-time bantamweight champion in Japanese promotion Rizin - was 34-year-old Pantoja's third defence of his belt.It was also announced during the broadcast that South Africa's Dricus du Plessis will defend his middleweight title against American Sean Strickland at UFC 312 in Sydney, Australia on 9 February.China's Zhang Weili will put her strawweight belt on the line against American Tatiana Suarez on the same card.'Extraordinary' -

until Machado Garry.The pair showed respect to each other during fight week having trained together in the past, and Machado Garry greeted Rakhmonov with a fist-bump as he entered the octagon.The first two rounds saw little significant action with the pair battling for position in the clinch against the cage and Rakhmonov landing a couple of eye-catching right hands.Machado Garry started to find success in the third as he opened up with an array of kicks, before having to change his shorts at the end of the round after sporting a large rip down the back.Rakhmovov took control in the fourth round as he landed the first takedowns of the fight before delivering some big blows on the ground.With Machado Garry knowing he likely needed a finish to secure the win, his best moment came in the final round.After taking Rakhmonov's back, Machado Garry battled for a rear-naked choke on the ground as the crowd roared the Irishman on, but the Kazakh defended well before navigating safely to the end of the contest.The pair showed further respect, kneeling in front of one another and sharing some words after the bout, before raising each other's arms in the air.Related topicsMixed Martial ArtsMMA schedule and results 2024Published14 December 2024Watch every Born to Brawl episodePublished28 April 2024More MMA from the BBCNotifications, social media and more with BBC SportPublished31 JanuaryTop storiesLive. Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win -
