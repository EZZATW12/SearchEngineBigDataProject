We pride ourselves on being a family club, there are a lot of kids in the stand and that is not how you end the game of football, but when someone comes on and attacks one of your teammates it is only natural you are going to react to it and that Glentoran would react to that.""It's not something we want to be associated with, and it is disappointing that that is what the talking points will be and not the grit and determination to get over the line against a good Glentoran side that threw the kitchen sink at us but couldn't break us."Haveron said that having watched the brawl back he hopes that the main perpetrators will be dealt with accordingly."You have to say to the boys to step back because it drags on and on but there was an antagonist," he added."People will get punished and rightfully so, I hope the antagonist is punished the most."Related topicsIrish FootballTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9934 viewing9.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished8 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Northern Ireland sportThe 'rugby student' stepping up to lead IrelandPre-contract agreements - why are they different in NI?Record-breaker Dunlop 'breaks mould' of modern sporting heroesMeet Jude McAtamney - the New York Giants kicker from Derry Elsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
