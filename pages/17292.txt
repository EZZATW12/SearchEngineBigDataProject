Players and officials from both clubs became involved in unsavoury scenes across the pitch following full-time as a scoreless draw gave Larne the point they needed to secure European qualification. Larne's Aaron Donnelly and Conor McKendry, and Fuad Sule and Christie Pattison of Glentoran, were all sent off by referee Jamie Robinson."We are aware of and totally condemn the incidents following the Larne - Glentoran game on Saturday evening," a NIFL spokesman said on Sunday. "NIFL staff have been in contact with the match referee and the match observer to offer support, and we will await their respective official reports."We will work with the IFA Disciplinary Committee to make sure they have all the necessary information on this matter."The Irish FA said: "We are aware of the matter and, should it be formally referred to the Disciplinary Committee, normal disciplinary protocols will be followed in line with established procedures."'It was really unsavoury' - Haveron on mass brawlPublished1 day ago'You shouldn't lift your hands on a football pitch' - DevinePublished1 day agoThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, "No room for fighting" - Glens boss Declan Devine on Inver Park brawlSpeaking after the game, Glentoran boss Declan Devine said he "didn't see much" of the melee."My players stood up for each other on and off the pitch. I'd be more frustrated if my players lay down and took punches," he told BBC Sport NI."I'm extremely proud of the players, I want fight and commitment, maybe not to the level after the game, but it takes two to tango."There are certain players in our changing room who are frustrated with certain members of the Larne team instigating fights."Larne manager Gary Haveron described the scenes as "really unsavoury". "It is not something you want to see at games," said Haveron."We pride ourselves on being a family club, there are a lot of kids in the stand and that is not how you end the game of football, but when someone comes on and attacks one of your team-mates it is only natural you are going to react to it and that Glentoran would react to that."Having reviewed the footage, Haveron added: "You have to say to the boys to step back because it drags on and on but there was an antagonist."People will get punished and rightfully so, I hope the antagonist is punished the most."Related topicsNorthern Ireland SportFootballIrish FootballTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9139 viewing9.1k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished7 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Northern Ireland sportThe 'rugby student' stepping up to lead IrelandPre-contract agreements - why are they different in NI?Record-breaker Dunlop 'breaks mould' of modern sporting heroesMeet Jude McAtamney - the New York Giants kicker from Derry Elsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
