Hopefully one day we can get there and if we keep working hard, I'm pretty sure we can."Northern Ireland have lost the likes of Steven Davis, Stuart Dallas and Jonny Evans to retirement, the latter solely in the case of international football, since their last attempt to qualify for a World Cup.In their stead, O'Neill has relied on younger players like Bradley, Shea Charles, Isaac Price and Trai Hume."We've got potential but we need to fulfil that," Bradley added."Obviously we're still really young as it is, we've lost a lot of experience."We have to keep getting experience together and keep improving together, hopefully there'll be good things around the corner."Related topicsNorthern Ireland Men's Football TeamFootballFIFA World CupIrish FootballTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9934 viewing9.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished8 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Northern Ireland sportThe 'rugby student' stepping up to lead IrelandPre-contract agreements - why are they different in NI?Record-breaker Dunlop 'breaks mould' of modern sporting heroesMeet Jude McAtamney - the New York Giants kicker from Derry Elsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
