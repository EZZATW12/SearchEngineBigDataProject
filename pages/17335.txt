"It would be really special if we can get over the line," Bradley told BBC Sport NI. "Whenever you join a club like Liverpool you dream of winning the Premier League. "I have supported Liverpool all of my life and bringing home the Premier League would be so special."Big summer if Liverpool keep team together - SlotPublished18 AprilHow could Liverpool replace Alexander-Arnold?Published18 AprilLiverpool could clinch the title as early as Sunday should they beat Leicester City and Arsenal lose to Ipswich Town earlier that afternoon. Bradley, though, does not want to get caught up in the permutations. "We have just got to keep playing our football," added the full-back, who has made 14 Premier League appearances this season."We are top of the league for a reason, because we have played really good football, and hopefully if we can do that for a few more games we should have it won and I am sure there would be great celebrations if we do it too. "It's been a bit of a frustrating year for me with injuries, but I am really happy to be back and back with the team, and hopefully I can help as much as I can and bring the Premier League home."Despite his injuries, Bradley's performances have again drawn praise this season, most notably in a 2-0 Champions League win over Real Madrid that featured a crunching tackle on French star Kylian Mbappe.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Conor Bradley has made 14 appearances for Liverpool this seasonWith Trent Alexander-Arnold possibly leaving at the end of the season when his contract expires, Bradley could become even more important to Liverpool in the seasons ahead and the 23-time capped international has an unwavering desire to be at the Reds."It's my dream club," he said. "I am a Liverpool fan all my life so I am enjoying my time here. "I just want to keep working really hard and keep doing well for the club and keep bringing trophies home if possible."Bradley, who is involved in ongoing contract talks himself, was thrilled to see Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk recently sign contract extensions to remain at Anfield, especially after months of speculation."It's really good for the likes me because they are putting faith in the club and they know the club is going in the right direction," he said."To play with players of [their] calibre is a privilege. "Just how good they are, not just in games but in training every day, and the things you can learn of them, it's brilliant and good for every Liverpool fan out there."'It shows me that hard work pays off'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Rory McIlroy became just the sixth man to win golf's career Grand Slam on SundayAs he nears his own memorable triumph, Bradley added that he has taken inspiration from golfer Rory McIlroy's success at the Masters last weekend.The County Tyrone native, a keen golfer himself, watched his fellow sportsman from Northern Ireland claim the green jacket on television and was struck by McIlroy's determination in completing the career Grand Slam."Rory's a massive inspiration. I think what Rory did last week was unbelievable, what he did was so special, so amazing to complete the Grand Slam," he said."It shows me that hard work pays off. He been trying for 11 years to get it done. "I am really proud and pretty sure everyone back home has the same feeling."Related topicsLiverpoolNorthern Ireland Men's Football TeamNorthern Ireland SportPremier LeagueFootballTop storiesLive. Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win - latest & reaction9415 viewing9.4k viewingLive. World Snooker Championship - live text9813 viewing9.8k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published15 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Northern Ireland sportThe 'rugby student' stepping up to lead IrelandPre-contract agreements - why are they different in NI?Record-breaker Dunlop 'breaks mould' of modern sporting heroesMeet Jude McAtamney - the New York Giants kicker from Derry Elsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
