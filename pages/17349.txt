"I thought maybe this could be my night, I took the first chance I had so I was buzzing," Weir continued."To get my first goal at the National Stadium is unreal. I didn't know what to do [after scoring] I just let everyone run to me, I just thought 'there's no way' but it feels great."The young forward seems to have already formed a good understanding with fellow striker and Northern Ireland captain Magill, someone she looked up to when breaking through."She's an inspiration playing in the nine and me being a striker as well she is a really good mentor on and off the pitch and playing alongside her is amazing."We had two strikers, so we were rotating, it felt fluid, and it felt good to have runners in behind and others dropping deep to play the set and go [passes]."The ambitious teenager believes Northern Ireland should now be hunting down group leaders Poland, who drew 1-1 with Bosnia-Herzegovina on Tuesday.Tanya Oxtoby's side are three points behind Poland, who they face next at Windsor Park on 30 May before finishing their campaign against the Bosnians on 3 June."I feel the squad is strong and everyone knows we're capable of it. I feel as long as we go out and perform in the next two games, we are more than ready to top the group."Related topicsNorthern Ireland SportNorthern Ireland Women's Football TeamWomen's FootballComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 1Top storiesLive. Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win - latest & reaction11310 viewing11k viewingLive. World Snooker Championship - live text11358 viewing11k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published15 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Northern Ireland sportThe 'rugby student' stepping up to lead IrelandPre-contract agreements - why are they different in NI?Record-breaker Dunlop 'breaks mould' of modern sporting heroesMeet Jude McAtamney - the New York Giants kicker from Derry Elsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
