"We knew it was going to be tougher than people maybe expected. "I think the other results in the group have shown it's a really tight race and there are no easy games, so to get a result at home, I'm ecstatic."Teenager Weir's first Northern Ireland goal sinks RomaniaGlentoran striker Weir, 18, scored after being played in by fellow youngster Keri Halliday.Northern Ireland and Romania both created chances to find the net at Windsor Park, as Ellie Mason saw an effort tipped on to the crossbar and Mihaela Ciolacu forced Jackie Burns into an injury-time save.The result lifted Northern Ireland after an error handed Romania an equaliser in Bucharest. "I asked for a little bit more resilience in the defensive third," added Oxtoby. "We knew Romania would create chances in the way that they play."I said, 'defend for your lives', and I think we did tonight. A clean sheet and no defeat, that's the motto. I give the defenders a lot of credit and the kids were sensational. "Keri [Halliday] to Kascie [Weir] for the goal is something we have been working on so I'm really pleased for them that they have got reward for that."Related topicsNorthern Ireland SportNorthern Ireland Women's Football TeamFootballWomen's FootballTop storiesLive. Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win - latest & reaction11310 viewing11k viewingLive. World Snooker Championship - live text11358 viewing11k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published15 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Northern Ireland sportThe 'rugby student' stepping up to lead IrelandPre-contract agreements - why are they different in NI?Record-breaker Dunlop 'breaks mould' of modern sporting heroesMeet Jude McAtamney - the New York Giants kicker from Derry Elsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
