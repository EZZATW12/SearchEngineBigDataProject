On the victory: "To be fair to them, the game wasn't the prettiest, but they did something they haven't done enough of this year, defend their box really well and be clinical with their chance. There were questions about Kirk [McLaughlin] being offside, but he still had plenty of work to do when he got the ball, but it was a very good individual goal."On building for next year: "The last few games, it gives me the chance to have conversations with players see who is up for the fight in the Championship and have a clearer picture of where the club is going to be."00Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingWatch: McWoods lobs O'Neill for Reds' fifth goalpublished at 17:18 British Summer Time 5 April17:18 BST 5 AprilFT: Cliftonville 5-0 Ballymena UnitedA sumptuous lob from substitute Eric McWoods for his second of the game and Cliftonville's fifth late on.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: McWoods makes it 5-0 to the Reds at Solitude61Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharing'Point gained for Larne'published at 17:14 British Summer Time 5 April17:14 BST 5 AprilFT: Crusaders 2-2 LarneLiam BeckettSportsound summariserI think it is a point gained for Larne because Crusaders bossed the second half.

David Healy's side had secured the Irish Premiership title in March and, knowing a trophy presentation was to come, could enjoy the occasion against their fierce rivals.Kirk Millar struck a first-half winner for Linfield after Jordan Jenkins had cancelled out Callumn Morrison's opener for the hosts.Captain Jamie Mulgrew, himself winning his 11th Irish Premiership title, lifted the Gibson Cup as thousands of Linfield supporters enjoyed the celebrations at a sun-soaked Windsor Park."I'm full of adrenaline and emotion, it was a great day," Healy told BBC Sport NI. "Our performance levels were pretty good and Glentoran made us work for it. All in all, the players and staff have been incredible this year. It's been hugely challenging, but I'm so pleased for them."The manner in which we won it this year was incredible. I couldn't be more proud of the players and the staff."Larne miss chance to go second after draw with CruesPublished5 AprilWin icing on the cake before celebrationsIt has been a remarkable league campaign for Linfield, who ended Larne's two-year stint as champions in emphatic fashion.As their rivals faltered, Linfield consistently collected points and became the first team to seal the title before the split - which occurs with five matches remaining. The victory over Glentoran, who were unbeaten against the Blues this season in five outings, was the icing on the cake.In a frantic first half, Morrison opened the scoring as he squeezed an effort past Glens goalkeeper Daniel Gyollai in the ninth minute, but Declan Devine's side hit back when Jordan Jenkins fired home in the 22nd minute.However, Linfield stalwart Millar restored Linfield's lead on the half-hour and the hosts, who spurned chances to extend their lead after the break, never looked back.Such was their dominance, Linfield's lead at the full-time whistle over Glentoran stood at a mammoth 25 points.It is a 57th Gibson Cup for Linfield, and no team has won their domestic league more times in world football than the Blues. Image source, Press EyeImage caption, Captain Jamie Mulgrew (left) celebrated his 11th Irish Premiership title with LinfieldIt has been an emotional year for Linfield after the loss of staff member Paul Butler and former defender Michael Newberry. Both were honoured as Mulgrew lifted the Gibson Cup with Butler's name - as it has been all season - embroidered into the blue shirt while Newberry also had a Linfield jersey with his name printed on it. "I'm incredibly proud of the team and the effort they have put in, and the emphatic way we won the league," Mulgrew said."At the start of the season we never could have envisaged it would have ended this way. I'm proud of my record of 11 league titles but I'm just really proud and privileged to lead this team."Mulgrew, 38, added it was "important to put on a show and win" against Glentoran so players, staff and supporters could fully embrace the celebrations. "It's trophy day and it's important that you win to enjoy the moment even more," he said. "We want to get as many points as we can to build a platform for next season."I'm already looking forward to what we achieve next year, we want to remain hungry and determined after what we have achieved here."Related topicsFootballIrish FootballIrish Premiership Scores & FixturesSaturday 5th AprilLinfield 2 , Glentoran 1 at Full timeLinfieldLinfieldLinfield21GlentoranGlentoranGlentoranFull timeFTColeraine 3 , Dungannon Swifts 2 at Full timeColeraineColeraineColeraine32DungannonDungannon SwiftsDungannon SwiftsFull timeFTCrusaders 2 , Larne 2 at Full timeCrusadersCrusadersCrusaders22LarneLarneLarneFull timeFTCarrick Rangers 4 , Portadown 1 at Full timeCarrickCarrick RangersCarrick Rangers41PortadownPortadownPortadownFull timeFTCliftonville 5 , Ballymena United 0 at Full timeCliftonvilleCliftonvilleCliftonville50Ballymena UtdBallymena UnitedBallymena UnitedFull timeFTGlenavon 0 , Loughgall 1 at Full timeGlenavonGlenavonGlenavon01LoughgallLoughgallLoughgallFull timeFTView all Irish Premiership fixturesIrish Premiership TableOn Saturday 5th AprilSkip to table keyTeamPlayedWonDrawnLostGoals ForGoals AgainstGoal DifferencePointsForm, Last 6 games, Oldest first1Linfield35264566254182LResult LossWResult WinWResult WinWResult WinWResult WinWResult Win2Glentoran35169104334957DResult DrawDResult DrawDResult DrawLResult LossWResult WinLResult Loss3Larne351511942311156WResult WinDResult DrawDResult DrawWResult WinDResult DrawDResult Draw4Coleraine351410115345852WResult WinDResult DrawDResult DrawWResult WinLResult LossWResult Win5Dungannon Swifts35156144744351LResult LossWResult WinDResult DrawLResult LossDResult DrawLResult Loss6Crusaders35156144448-451WResult WinLResult LossDResult DrawWResult WinLResult LossDResult DrawView latest Irish Premiership tableTeamPlayedWonDrawnLostGoals ForGoals AgainstGoal DifferencePointsForm, Last 6 games, Oldest first1Cliftonville351571352381452LResult LossLResult LossDResult DrawWResult WinWResult WinWResult Win2Portadown35138144143-247LResult LossWResult WinDResult DrawLResult LossDResult DrawLResult Loss3Ballymena United35144174549-446WResult WinLResult LossWResult WinLResult LossWResult WinLResult Loss4Glenavon351010153645-940LResult LossDResult DrawLResult LossLResult LossDResult DrawLResult Loss5Carrick Rangers3579192952-2330WResult WinLResult LossDResult DrawLResult LossLResult LossWResult Win6Loughgall3556243276-4421LResult LossLResult LossDResult DrawWResult WinLResult LossWResult WinView latest Irish Premiership tableTeamPlayedWonDrawnLostGoals ForGoals AgainstGoal DifferencePointsForm, Last 6 games, Oldest first1Linfield33244561233876LResult LossWResult WinWResult WinWResult WinWResult WinWResult Win2Larne33159939281154WResult WinDResult DrawDResult DrawWResult WinDResult DrawDResult Draw3Glentoran3315994031954DResult DrawDResult DrawDResult DrawLResult LossWResult WinLResult Loss4Dungannon Swifts33155134440450LResult LossWResult WinDResult DrawLResult LossDResult DrawLResult Loss5Crusaders33155134143-250WResult WinLResult LossDResult DrawWResult WinLResult LossDResult Draw6Coleraine331310104941849WResult WinDResult DrawDResult DrawWResult WinLResult LossWResult Win7Cliftonville33137134437746LResult LossLResult LossDResult DrawWResult WinWResult WinWResult Win8Portadown33137133938146LResult LossWResult WinDResult DrawLResult LossDResult DrawLResult Loss9Ballymena United33134164042-243WResult WinLResult LossWResult WinLResult LossWResult WinLResult Loss10Glenavon33109143543-839LResult LossDResult DrawLResult LossLResult LossDResult DrawLResult Loss11Carrick Rangers3369182448-2427WResult WinLResult LossDResult DrawLResult LossLResult LossWResult Win12Loughgall3346232971-4218LResult LossLResult LossDResult DrawWResult WinLResult LossWResult WinView latest Irish Premiership tableKeyPosition 1 : UEFA Champions League QualifiersPosition 2 : UEFA Conference League QualifiersPosition 3 - 6 : UEFA Conference League Play-offsLast Updated 5th April 2025 at 16:57Please Note: All times UK.
