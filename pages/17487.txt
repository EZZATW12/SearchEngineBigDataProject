"It is one of those matches that you look back on and you say 'it wasn't their day' when you look at the chances they had."It should have been 2-2 and gone to extra time and then anything can happen."Any other day those chances go into the back of the net, so they will be really disappointed."They have had an amazing season so far and an FA Cup final would have been another cherry on top of the cake, but for most fans this will be remembered as the season of their lives under Nuno."Listen to the Football Daily podcast on BBC SoundsThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Nottingham Forest 0-2 Man City - the fans' verdictpublished at 09:4409:44Image source, Getty ImagesWe asked for your thoughts after Sunday's FA Cup semi-final between Nottingham Forest and Manchester City.Here are some of your replies:Forest fansBettsy: I'm so disappointed. Let's stop giving respect to City - they aren't that good.  We seem to set up in fear of them. A dreadful performance in the first half. Danilo is awful. Poor Zach Abbott has zero idea how to play full-back but did nothing wrong apart from wanting to play centre-back. Nuno got it wrong but hopefully we now understand that to be at the top, we have to play our game and not worry about them.Fosi: Nuno cost us the match! His team selection left us totally unbalanced. What on earth was he doing? He needs help selecting his team and system if this is his idea.John: As ever, I can't fault our effort and commitment. We hit the post twice and the crossbar. Their chances went in. It wasn't meant to be. It has still been - and it still is - a fantastic season. Heads up and beat Brentford on Thursday.Nicholas: I worry that after this poor and insipid performance, we will finish our season with a whimper rather than a roar. To have come so far and miss out on an FA Cup final, and possibly Europe, would be a harsh kick in the teeth for a team that have played well for much of the season. We simply weren't up for the occasion and bottled it.City fansBrian: City had the run of the green. Luck was on their side and Forest must feel that our goal was protected at all levels. But City will be full of belief now and they held on with a clean sheet. Given their really poor mid-season, this is a remarkable position to be in. They are in a great position to win the FA Cup and achieve Champions League qualification. We would have taken both at the start of this season.John: It just shows what a toll playing too many games is having on the players.  They now have energy and enjoyment they had lost in mid-season. But what a performance from Forest - good luck to them for Champions League places!Gene: At first, I was surprised to see Rico Lewis in the line-up, and even more so when he scored. They had possession and looked comfortable, but defensively were sloppy on multiple occasions. Forest are a counter-attacking team and were unable to capitalise on City's mistakes and poor decisions. The match could have gone either way, so City were fortunate to leave with the win.Krish: It was quite good back to our old ways. Lewis was brilliant and so was Bernardo Silva and Mateo Kovacic. Hopefully, Erling Haaland and Rodri get a bit of playing time against Southampton.22:42 27 AprilFive points separate five teams - who will prosper in race for Europe?, published at 22:42 27 AprilFive points separate five teams - who will prosper in race for Europe?AttributionPremier League19:21 27 AprilMan City beat luckless Forest to reach third straight FA Cup final, published at 19:21 27 AprilMan City beat luckless Forest to reach third straight FA Cup finalAttributionFA CupComments1159'I hold my hands up and apologise'published at 19:20 27 April19:20 27 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesNottingham Forest midfielder Morgan Gibbs-White has been speaking to ITV about the result: "It's devastating. I feel sorry for the fans. I hold my hands up and apologise. I should have scored at least one of them chances."As a team, we did not start well. That is what we wanted to do. Then in the second half, we came out fighting and we gave it absolutely everything."The support never stopped until the very last second and we thank the fans for that because they have been so consistent with us throughout the season."I'm lost for words really, I'm sad to go out like that. We gave it our everything but we keep going. We have still got the Premier League to focus on."On his first chance: "I've never hit a ball as sweetly on my weak foot in my life. As soon as that hit the crossbar, I knew it wasn't going to be our day."On his second chance: "I should score that one. I go around the goalkeeper and if I score that, it gives everyone in the stadium energy to try and go again. Even though we were 2-0 down, we showed resilience and kept fighting. That is the main thing."I think if we get a goal, then we get another one. That was just the flow of the game  at that moment. We had a few good chances that we didn't make the most of and all I can put that down to is that it wasn't our day."We have a game plan that everyone believes in and sticks to. We executed it well in the first half. We nullified them, apart from their goal, and the main thing is that we came out fighting in the second half."Anthony [Elanga] is a big threat for us and he showed that in the second half. We've got to put this behind us now and focus on the league - five big finals. We are going to give it our absolute everything and hope for the best."19:14 27 April'A lot to fight for', says Forest boss Nuno.

Manchester City started the game much better than ourselves and they were really clinical. We played a good game - we did well, competed well and had our chances. We knew how hard it was going to be, but we gave it our all."It is important to take the positives. After the sadness and bad humour goes away, and you look back at the game, it makes us stronger for the future."On whether he should have started Anthony Elanga: "We had a lot of situations to decide. It was not an easy week to put the team together. We never know."We had a game plan, but everything changed in terms of the goal we conceded. But the way we responded and reacted was really positive."On their Premier League run-in and the race for European football: "When the sadness fades and the fans go back to Nottingham and they wake up tomorrow, they will see that we still have a lot to fight for."We will give it our all. We will try."19:01 27 April'Unlucky' Forest hit woodwork three times in second half.

The Reds exit this season's competition with just one win in five games (D3 L1), having progressed from all three previous rounds through penalty shootouts (against Exeter City, Ipswich Town and Brighton).Nuno Espirito Santo's side failed to attempt a shot in the first half at Wembley, making it just the second half of football all season where they have not had at least one shot (previously against Liverpool in September 2024).Zach Abbott (18 years and 349 days) was the youngest player to start an FA Cup game at Wembley since Marcus Rashford (18 years and 203 days) for Manchester United in the 2016 final against Crystal Palace.Nottingham Forest 0-2 Man City - send us your thoughtspublished at 18:24 27 April18:24 27 AprilWere you at the game or following from elsewhere?Have your say on Nottingham Forest's performanceWhat did you make of Man City's display?Come back to this page on Monday to find a selection of your repliesFollow Sunday's FA Cup semi-final livepublished at 15:20 27 April15:20 27 AprilThe second FA Cup semi-final of the weekend takes place on Sunday live from Wembley and BBC Sport will bring you every kick.Nottingham Forest v Manchester City (16:30)Listen to the match on BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra hereFollow all of the action and reaction hereSutton's predictions: Nottingham Forest v Man Citypublished at 12:19 27 April12:19 27 AprilPep Guardiola's team selection will be absolutely crucial here.Both of Manchester City's goals against Aston Villa on Tuesday came from their players being prepared to run at defenders - firstly Omar Marmoush and then Jeremy Doku, who had started the game on the bench.But Pep appears to be very cautious at the moment, and has not been using his out-and-out wingers, Doku or Savinho, very much because he wants to try to control the middle of the pitch.Doku and Savinho both started when Forest beat City at the beginning of March, which was City's last defeat, seven games ago, but it's unlikely that they will both start at Wembley.That does not make this tie any easier to call, though.Forest bounced back from a couple of defeats with a win over Tottenham on Monday, which was a huge result for their top-five hopes, and we know the way they are set up to counter-attack can cause City problems.I am not just saying this because Forest were my boyhood team, but I want anyone but City to win the FA Cup this season.I've got nothing against City but it would be a great story if any of the other three teams won it because they have either not won anything for so long or, in Crystal Palace's case, they have never won a major trophy at all.Despite that, I just have a feeling that City are going to put in a good performance here, and earn the right to reach their third straight FA Cup final.As much I hate to say it, I am expecting Pep to find a way to win, the same way they did against Everton and Aston Villa - although I hope I am wrong. My predictions are so bad at the moment, there is a good chance I will be.Sutton's prediction: 1-2Read the full predictions and have your say here'The fans will have a huge part to play'published at 15:34 26 April15:34 26 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesFormer defender Steve Cook believes Nottingham Forest will have a "fan advantage" over Manchester City at Wembley in their FA Cup semi-final.On BBC Radio Nottingham's Shut Up And Show More Football podcast, he spoke about his experience playing for Forest at Wembley in the 2022 Championship play-off final against Huddersfield Town.Cook said: "We knew the atmosphere would be leaning in our favour, and I think that will be the same on Sunday."The Forest players will know they have a fan advantage and it's huge. When we walked out it was like a home match, but bigger and better."The fans will have a huge part to play. They played a big part in the play-off final. They'll know because every home match they turn up, and you've seen how well the players have responded to it."The players in the play-off final knew how much it meant, and the players now will know."You can listen to the full podcast hereNottingham Forest v Man City: Did you know?published at 11:30 26 April11:30 26 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesSince the 2021-22 campaign, Ryan Yates has had a hand in eight FA Cup goals in 13 games for Nottingham Forest (four goals, four assists), five more than any other player.

There are 34,000 Forest fans out there and they are with you, so let's give them a team and performance they can be proud off. Work as a team and work for your brothers in arms.

From a club perspective, they wont want this to be the culmination. They'll want 17 May, the final, or the qualification for the Champions League. That would be the culmination. But certainly this is one of the huge steps Forest have taken this season."We have talked about 'next steps' and this is another step for Forest, their first semi-final at the new Wembley.

They sit third in the Premier League with five games remaining in the race for the Champions League.Either Crystal Palace or Aston Villa await in the final as Nuno looks to keep his squad focused. He said: "It's the same, we have to look at the game as the same. The approach is exactly the same, you don't have to shield them, it's impossible to shield a squad when there's so much information. "We have to go as a group of players and staff to compete. That's the best way to enjoy a semi final, to compete."Neco Williams and captain Ryan Yates are banned for the game but will travel with the squad Nuno added: "They can do whatever they can, all the squad is going to travel. There's going to be a moment where we are all together.
