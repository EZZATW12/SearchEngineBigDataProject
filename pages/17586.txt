He has delivered 10 league wins and 32 points from 18 games.There will be issues to deal with in the summer – Cunha's future being the biggest – but Wolves are enjoying the ride for now.Vardy's Foxes fairytale ending as a nightmareThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Not acceptable, attitude doesn't require talent - Van NistelrooyIf Vardy's Leicester career has largely been a fairytale, this season has been a nightmare. The striker, who will leave the Foxes when his contract expires in the summer, has described the campaign as a "total embarrassment".This was a 17th defeat in 19 league games and an 18th in Van Nistelrooy's 23 matches in charge. It has been a sorry season, and this was another miserable game, a third 3-0 defeat in their last six outings.Vardy tried to roll back the years when he won a spot-kick, making sure he was caught by goalkeeper Sa, but his tame penalty summed up Leicester's day and another powderpuff performance.Leicester have scored just six goals in the league since 8 December so the travelling fans were denied a chance to celebrate a collector's item.Vardy is tantalisingly close to reaching 200 goals for Leicester in his 13 years at the club.Whether he gets there or not, he will be signing off with the Foxes on their way down and showing few signs they might quickly recover from this jolt of a season.The Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

the reverse fixture, Wolves are looking to complete their first league double over Leicester City since the 1957-58 campaign.Leicester have won just three of their last 19 away league games against Wolves (D7 L9), though one of these was a 4-0 victory in their most recent visit in October 2022.Leicester have only kept more Premier League clean sheets against Newcastle (13) and Southampton (9) than they have against Wolves (8), despite only facing the Midlands side 13 times in the competition.Wolves have won each of their last five Premier League games, last having a longer run in the top-flight in September/October 1970 (6).Leicester have been relegated from the Premier League for the fifth time, after 1994-95, 2001-02, 2003-04 and 2022-23. The last time they suffered the drop before the final game of the season was in 2003-04, with the Foxes winning their first game following relegation back then (3-1 vs Portsmouth).Leicester have failed to score in a league-high 15 different Premier League games this season, only failing to do so in more in the 2001-02 campaign (19).Leicester have kept just one clean sheet in the Premier League this season, and have conceded in each of their last 26 matches. It’s their longest run without a league clean sheet since a streak of 37 between February and December 1957.Both Wolves and Leicester have conceded a league-high 12 headed goals in the Premier League this season. However, Wolves have netted the fewest headers of any side this term (2).Leicester have conceded 73 goals in the Premier League this season. It’s their most in a single league campaign since 1994-95 (80), and most in a 20-team league since 1914-15 (88).Matheus Cunha has scored 14 Premier League goals this season – the only Wolves player with more in a single campaign is Raúl Jiménez (17 in 2019-20).Live TextPostat 90 minutes plus 690'+6Match ends, Wolverhampton Wanderers 3, Leicester City 0.Full Timeat 90 minutes plus 690'+6Second Half ends, Wolverhampton Wanderers 3, Leicester City 0.Postat 90 minutes plus 590'+5Attempt missed.
