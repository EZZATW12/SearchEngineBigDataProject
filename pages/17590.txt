David Moyes said the 32-year-old's recovery could also impact the Toffees' pre-season preparations for the 2025-2026 campaign. Tarkowski hobbled off injured during the 2-0 home defeat by Manchester City last weekend. He has not missed a league game since joining Everton in July 2022.Moyes said losing the centre-back for the remaining five Premier League matches was a "big blow". "Tarky plays such a huge part in how we've done so well in this period," said the Everton boss on Friday. The Toffees are 13th in the table and face Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. Tarkowski has been a key player during his time at Everton, and he scored a memorable last-gasp equaliser against Liverpool at Goodison Park in February. His injury means he falls two games short of equalling Wayne Bridge's Premier League record of 113 consecutive starts for an outfield player.
