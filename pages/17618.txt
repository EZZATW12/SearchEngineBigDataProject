We were so determined to win the game, so good!Oscar: What an ending! Yasin Ayari - where do I start? He bossed the midfield and scored a goal to fit his perfect performance. Kaoru Mitoma was an amazing super-sub, using his pace down the wing. Carlos Baleba was in a different position to where he usually plays, but he played it really well. The whole team played amazing to comeback from 1-2 to win 3-2. Just amazing!Tom: An absolutely incredible end to the game. A rollercoaster of emotions; however we cannot rely on late equalisers and winners. We need to build on this result and try to get maximum points. If West Ham hadn't switched off towards the end of the game, we would have gone away with no points. Fabian Hurzeler is a lucky man!Noddy: No goalkeeper in the world would have been able to save those two goals.Chris: A decent 'paper-over-the-cracks' performance at last, but that still can't win over a disappointing season. European football is only a very slim chance given Fulham and Bournemouth are still collecting points, our on and off form and unpredictable player performances. It really has been a wasted run-in so far. A change is needed at the top for next season.West Ham fansSteve: A better performance - very encouraging. We have nothing to play for, admittedly. It's about building for next year now. I think Potter should be given time, I'm starting to see us on the front foot. We move on.Justin: Poor, lacklustre, abysmal! Take your pick. Potter has shown no tactical ability in his starting line-ups or substitutions. The team has shown no signs of improvement under him. I wasn't enamoured by his appointment. To only avoid a relegation battle because the three teams below us are so dire just isn't good enough for a man who was at one time going to be England's new manager.Anthony: We were doing well and then we brought on Vladimir Coufal and he immediately helped Brighton score. It was a poor decision from Potter. They are playing well under him, and gradually improving, but they are either missing scoring opportunities or giving goals away by poor defending. Plenty of work to be done this summer.Rod: Shocking, embarrassing, limp, laughable, clueless and unprofessional. Did I miss anything?Peter: No amount of feeble excuses from Potter will disguise the fact that he has failed to fulfil his mandate.Baleba has 'got that in his locker'published at 08:0808:08Chris WiseFinal Score reporter at Amex StadiumImage source, Getty ImagesAn auxiliary centre-half scoring a screamer to win the match with the last kick of the game? Sounds like the stuff of fantasy.Perhaps that is why the reaction to Brighton's Carlos Baleba's sublime goal against West Ham was met with almost disbelieving scenes of chaos at Amex Stadium.But to nab a well-used sporting phrase - 'he's got that in his locker'.Baleba's attributes are well spread - physically imposing, athletic, comfortable with the ball, and clearly a scorer of very decent goals.It will be interesting to see if Brighton persist with Baleba as a centre-half. Speaking to several people around the club at the weekend, the general consensus was that he would make an excellent defender. Mind you, he might need some convincing if the club do think that is a plausible route.Fabian Hurzeler will hope that moment revitalises their season, because the headlines could have been very different at the weekend. They have still got Newcastle and Liverpool to come at home, so there was a real sense that they needed this win.Gossip: Van Hecke on Newcastle shortlist published at 07:4707:47Newcastle United's shortlist for defensive reinforcements includes Dutchman Jan Paul van Hecke from Brighton.

It was an amazing feeling."I think we deserved the three points but it wasn't our best game to be fair. We can play much better. I think we dropped our intensity when I scored my first goal and they then came into the game and started to create some chances."In the end, I think we showed a good winning mentality. We didn't stop believing today."The winning mentality we have in this team, amongst this group of lads, is unbelievable. I'm grateful to have them as teammates. Everyone is training hard and staying humble, and for sure it paid off."On scoring his first goal for the club: "I'm so happy about it. I can't describe it really, it's amazing."On getting back into the starting XI: "I think I've been playing a lot. I think I'm deserving it. I show every time that I deserve to play, and today I scored my first goal so I'm happy."Listen to the full interview here18:27 26 AprilWe always had the belief - Hurzeler reacts to comeback win over West Ham.

You saw the reaction from the players, the crowd, the staff and the fans. We really wanted to win so this was a special moment."You always have to believe and trust your ability - and that is what the guys did today. They had setbacks but they reacted in the right way. They stayed together, especially the way skipper Lewis [Dunk] led the team was impressive."Brighton stem poor run with defiant comebackpublished at 18:00 26 April18:00 26 AprilJoe NelsonBBC Sport journalistImage source, Getty ImagesGoing into Saturday's game against West Ham, Brighton had not won in the Premier League since beating Fulham at the start of March.Fabian Hurzeler's side have struggled with consistency this term, having gone unbeaten in their first nine.These fluctuating performances mean the Seagulls have dropped out of Champions League and Europa League contention, but against West Ham they got back to winning ways.After Yasin Ayari's early stunner was overturned by second-half efforts from Mohammed Kudus and Tomas Soucek, Hurzeler's team could have felt sorry for themselves and settled for another defeat but they didn't.They piled on the pressure before Kaoru Mitoma's header and Carlos Baleba's fine strike took them from defeat to victory in a matter of three late minutes.The jubilant celebrations at the Amex Stadium demonstrated that Brighton believe they still have plenty to play for this season.Brighton 3-2 West Ham: Key statspublished at 17:34 26 April17:34 26 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesOnly in 2022-23 (62) and 1981-82 (52) have Brighton earned more points in a top-flight season than their 51 points this term.Six of Kaoru Mitoma's nine Premier League goals for Brighton this season have come in 2025, netting as a substitute in each of his past two appearances.'We have shown great character after a tough run'published at 17:12 26 April17:12 26 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesBrighton captain Lewis Dunk has been speaking to Sky Sports following the win: "That was good fun. We started excellently but, once we went 1-0 up, we stopped playing and the intensity dropped."In the second half, they started better but we showed character to win the game."I'm just buzzing. We have shown great character after a tough run. It is massive to keep us in the race to where we want to go."On Carlos Baleba's goal: "We have worked on tactics around needing a goal in the last minute, but that wasn't a tactic. But he put it in the top corner so the gaffer can't say anything."17:11 26 AprilBaleba stunner edges five-goal thriller against West Ham, published at 17:11 26 AprilBaleba stunner edges five-goal thriller against West HamAttributionPremier LeagueComments444Brighton 3-2 West Ham - send us your thoughtspublished at 16:54 26 April16:54 26 AprilWere you at the game or following from elsewhere?Have your say on Brighton's performanceWhat did you make of West Ham's display?Come back to this page on Monday to find a selection of your repliesFollow Saturday's Premier League games livepublished at 11:39 26 April11:39 26 AprilFive matches make up Saturday's Premier League action and BBC Sport will bring you every kick.Chelsea v Everton (12:30)Brighton v West HamNewcastle v Ipswich - BBC Radio 5 Live commentarySouthampton v Fulham Wolves v Leicester All kick-off times 15:00 BST unless statedFollow all of the action and reaction hereSutton's predictions: Brighton v West Hampublished at 11:16 26 April11:16 26 AprilBoth of these teams are badly in need of a win - Brighton have gone five games without a victory, while West Ham are on a run of six.There are a lot of unhappy Hammers fans at the moment, especially after they could only draw with Southampton last week.That is not the kind of result that wins fans over, and seeing Graham Potter take Jarrod Bowen off with the score at 1-0 did not help.Potter has picked up fewer points per game since taking charge than his predecessor, Julen Lopetegui, and I don't see much changing for him on his return to the Amex, where he had a much happier time.Brighton have issues too - their form has fallen off a cliff of late and their supporters are not pleased with the way they are finishing the season either.They have still had a decent campaign, but they have become leaky at the back and they could do with a positive result or two if they are going to stay in with a chance of making it into Europe.Sutton's prediction: 2-1Read the full predictions and have your say here The answerpublished at 16:55 25 April16:55 25 AprilImage source, PA MediaEarlier, we asked you to name the current Brighton player from a series of clues.The correct answer is Danny Welbeck.13:51 25 AprilBrighton must avoid happy-clappy culture - Hurzeler , published at 13:51 25 AprilBrighton must avoid happy-clappy culture - Hurzeler AttributionBrightonHurzeler on Van Hecke, Pedro red card and 'model' commentpublished at 10:36 25 April10:36 25 AprilSean ByrneBBC Sport journalistBrighton boss Fabian Hurzeler has been speaking to the media before Saturday's Premier League game against West Ham at Amex Stadium (kick-off 15:00 BST).Here are the key lines from his news conference:On Jan Paul van Hecke's availability after being stretchered off against Brentford: "No, not available. Everyone saw the foul, it was a tough one. We have to be careful with his health. We can't risk him."On when Van Hecke can be expected back: "If we follow all the protocols, he will be back next week."Joel Veltman "will be an option" for Saturday after a foot injury has left him on the sidelines since February.On Joao Pedro being unavailable after his red card against Brentford: "Very frustrating. I said after the game, he immediately apologised. He knew he did something wrong. We had a discussion with him and we said we don't accept stuff like this."He adds Pedro is a "young player who makes mistakes", adding: "Hopefully he learns from this in the future."On reports he had ambitions to be a model before his managerial career: "I don't want to be one [a model]. It was more to identify myself with the city. I'm not just here as a coach, I'm here to integrate into the city. It's key if you really want to build a connection to the people and to the city."Follow all of Friday's Premier League news conferences and the rest of the day's football newsBrighton v West Ham: Did you know?published at 09:54 25 April09:54 25 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesBrighton's Danny Welbeck is looking to score 10 goals in a Premier League season for the first time (currently nine). As it stands, he is the highest scorer in the competition never to reach double figures in a single campaign (76 goals). He's scored more goals against West Ham than any other opponent in the top flight (six).Today's trivia challengepublished at 08:38 25 April08:38 25 AprilGuess the current Brighton player from these three clues:I joined Brighton in 2020.Earlier in my career, I played for two former Premier League-winning clubs.I scored the only goal in a 1-0 win at Newcastle in October.Come back to this page later on Friday for the answer'Can't let Potter take points off us'published at 08:55 24 April08:55 24 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesFormer Brighton striker Warren Aspinall has been discussing the upcoming fixture against Graham Potter's West Ham on Albion Unlimited: "Some of this West Ham side are hiding because ofthe  stick they get from fans. They are coasting. We can't have Potter taking another point from us at our place. No way!"Yasin Ayari has been a bright light in the past couple of games and is a very intelligent player, but where he plays depends on if Carlos Beleba plays at centre-back, which I think is his best position. Play him at centre-back or take him out if Jan Paul van Hecke is fit."I think Kaoru Mitoma comes straight in and Danny Welbeck starts up front. Do they play Yankuba Minteh? I would take him off, for sure."Listen on BBC Sounds'Underperformed' or 'more than acceptable'? Fans on Albion's seasonpublished at 20:00 23 April20:00 23 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesWe asked for your thoughts on whether fans need to keep perspective when reflecting upon this season - as argued by BBC Radio Sussex's Johnny Cantor below (13:00 BST) - or whether Brighton have underachieved.Here are some of your comments:Richard: Brighton underperformed, perhaps by lack of selection continuity. Not convinced yet by Fabian Hurzeler's ability. Nice is sadly not usually a attribute of successful Premier League managers.Mark: Totally agree. In perspective, this is still one of the best ever finishes for the club, and if we can turn the form around for the last few games it could still make for another European tour next season.Alex: People seem to forget where the club has come from and believe the only acceptable place for the team is in Europe. The Premier League is considered one of the toughest out there and finishing anywhere above the drop zone - especially with  a new squad, new manager, inconsistent injuries and an influx of fans with little awareness of the history of Brighton - is more than acceptable at this point of time.Tim: It has been something of a curate's egg. It seems the coach and his team get to a point where they are lavished with praise - only then to fall away to mediocrity. I feel at this point they are going to find it difficult to climb out of the pit they are currently in and the concern must be it will carry over into the next campaign. Let's hope not!Martin: I think we need a balanced view on this season. There is clearly much to do, but in the context of a very tough Premier League, a finish in the top half would be acceptable and top eight a success. So let's see and remember we are living the dream.previous pagePage 1 of 42123456…42next pageHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright © 2025 BBC.
