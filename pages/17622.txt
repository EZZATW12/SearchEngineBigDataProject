To hold on to a 1-0 lead for that long, and then fight through a determined last 20 minutes from Everton, was surprising. It has left me delighted. We look so much better when we thrust at opponents, rather than this slow build-up and possession style that is one poor pass and counter-attack away from catastrophe. The Premier League has few easy games but a win was a must. We need to show the same doggedness against better opposition and further raise our game. The Champions League remains a possibility.Gary: Poor performance from Chelsea. They got a win but their ability in front of goal is appalling! We need a striker who can control the ball and bring other players into the game. Nicolas Jackson is not that player.Paul: Like petulant children, Madueke and Jackson were an embarrassment to Chelsea football club in the second half. Sad days indeed.Jak: Papering over the cracks - we just about saw off a strangely passive Everton team. Enzo Maresca is a fraud who is way out of his depth and is squandering the talent at his disposal. In a poor Premier League season, we should have coasted to at least fourth place, but we will ultimately miss out on Champions League qualification due to his ineptitude.Everton fansDave: Unfortunately we are too slow in midfield to compete with the top teams. We employ wide men yet we continue to pass through the midfield and get pickpocketed every time. A major clearout is needed to begin the 2025-26 season at our new ground.Chris: Sadly yet another mistake cost us the game. A draw would have been a fairer result, although that would have been our 15th of the season. They won the first half but we won the second half, even though we failed to score. Moyes has done well but we need to convert draws to wins and 1-0 losses to draws. We lack quality, and fighting spirit is not always enough. Let's go for maximum points from our last games.Peter: Everton are on the beach, just as Moyes feared. The creativity, work rate, control and finishing have all gone on holiday. It was like an old Sean Dyche set-up.Greg: Moyes persists with Abdoulaye Doucoure and Jack Harrison but neither give us anything. Carlos Alcaraz has to start and Dwight McNeil. Surely Moyes knows what he needs and, with the exception of Idrissa Gueye and Alcaraz, the rest of the out-of-contract or loan players can go.21:27 27 AprilEverton fan's playful sabotage of Liverpool party, published at 21:27 27 AprilEverton fan's playful sabotage of Liverpool partyAttributionLiverpoolCatch up on the Premier League actionpublished at 12:29 27 April12:29 27 AprilMark Chapman presents highlights and analysis from Saturday's five Premier League fixtures, which saw Ipswich Town's relegation from the top-flight confirmed.If you missed Match of the Day, you can catch up now on BBC iPlayer.Listen back to full match commentary from Newcastle United 3-0 Ipswich Town on BBC Sounds.'I'm happy to be back and just waiting to get my chance again'published at 20:55 26 April20:55 26 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesEverton winger Dwight McNeil has been speaking to BBC Radio Merseyside following the defeat at Stamford Bridge: "I felt like we were miles better in the second half. The first half was difficult, but it was always going to be difficult coming here."It was just a mistake that led to the goal and that's what happens at this level. If you make a mistake, you get punished - especially against a top side."That's what let us down today and not being productive enough in the final third. I think we have to create more clear cut chances because that's what we are lacking at the minute."On coming back after a long period out: "It was frustrating, four months out. I was playing through pain before but then I had the surgery and I just wanted to get back because I felt like I was playing well."I'm happy to be back with the lads and I'm just trying to get my fitness up every day in training. I'm trying to play for my place in the team."David Moyes coming in whilst I was injured has been a different experience for me, but I've been trying to learn what the manager wants. It's a different type of football that we are playing."I'm happy to be back and just waiting to get my chance again."On wanting to be in David Moyes' future plans: "Definitely, he talks to me about it a lot. He only wants the club to go one way, which we all do, and that is up. But there is still a lot of work that we all need to do to get to that point."Listen to the full interview here'We were just lacking quality'published at 16:15 26 April16:15 26 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesEverton boss David Moyes has been speaking to BBC Match of the Day about the defeat: "We were perhaps fortunate to only be 1-0 down at half-time, but we stuck at it and grew into the game and played very well in the second half."We were just lacking quality to get a finish on the end of some of our play. The substitutes made a big difference. It looked like we had more energy and were more creative."On Beto being dispossessed for the goal: "You see it in football all the time. We played the ball into the centre-forward's feet, he doesn't retain possession and the opposition go on and score."We don't accept it, but the modern game sees lots of players do it. We are trying to play better and these are the things we need to be better at."15:15 26 AprilEverton 'unlucky' not to get equaliser against Chelsea - Moyes.

Only against Leeds United (36 games between 1953 and 2001) have Everton had a longer winless away run in their league history.Everton have scored fewer away goals than any other Premier League side this season (12), with this game being the eighth time they have failed to find the net on the road this season.James Tarkowski failed to start a Premier League game for the first time since joining Everton. He had started 111 consecutive Premier League games before today, in a run stretching back to May 2022, but his absence brought an end to the third-longest run of consecutive starts for an outfield player in the competition's history, after Wayne Bridge (113 between 2000-2003) and Frank Lampard (112 between 2002-2005).Chelsea 1-0 Everton - send us your thoughtspublished at 14:27 26 April14:27 26 AprilWere you at Stamford Bridge or following from elsewhere?Have your say on Chelsea's performanceWhat did you make of Everton's display?Come back to this page on Monday to find a selection of your replies14:27 26 AprilJackson goal sends Chelsea back into Champions League places, published at 14:27 26 AprilJackson goal sends Chelsea back into Champions League placesAttributionPremier LeagueComments447Follow Saturday's Premier League games livepublished at 11:39 26 April11:39 26 AprilFive matches make up Saturday's Premier League action and BBC Sport will bring you every kick.Chelsea v Everton (12:30)Brighton v West HamNewcastle v Ipswich - BBC Radio 5 Live commentarySouthampton v Fulham Wolves v Leicester All kick-off times 15:00 BST unless statedFollow all of the action and reaction hereSutton's predictions: Chelsea v Evertonpublished at 18:56 25 April18:56 25 AprilThe worry for Everton is James Tarkowski is out for the season with the hamstring injury he sustained against Manchester City.That is a massive blow for them at the back, because they did not look the same team defensively once he went off.Everton are without striker Armando Broja too, because he is on loan from Chelsea and cannot face his parent club, but I feel like he has kind of been on trial in the past couple of games anyway.David Moyes has been having a look at Broja, probably to weigh up whether or not to sign him permanently in the summer, but Everton are probably better off with Beto leading their attack.He will be a threat running in behind when they try to break forward, and Abdoulaye Doucoure will get up there too in support.They might get some joy here because while Chelsea are still in the mix for the top five after their fightback to beat Fulham, things are clearly still not right with them.An element of their fans are just not having Enzo Maresca and his style of play, and it will be interesting to see how the Stamford Bridge crowd react if things don't go to plan on Saturday.I am really not convinced by Chelsea's attack at the moment, especially with Cole Palmer and Nicolas Jackson so out of form. Even with Tarkowski missing, they could struggle to break Everton down.Sutton's prediction: 1-1Read the full predictions and have your say here15:08 25 AprilTarkowski to undergo surgery on hamstring injury, published at 15:08 25 AprilTarkowski to undergo surgery on hamstring injuryAttributionEvertonMoyes on Tarkowski, centre-half options and Chelseapublished at 14:34 25 April14:34 25 AprilHolly BaconBBC Sport journalistThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Everton boss David Moyes has been speaking to the media before Saturday's Premier League game at Chelsea (kick-off 12:30 BST).Here are the key lines from his news conference:Moyes confirmed that James Tarkowski is out for the remainder of the season and will have an operation on his hamstring. He added: "It's a big blow to us because Tarky plays such a huge part of what we've done and how we've done so well in this period." He thinks the defender will be back for the start of pre-season but admitted it could start to "eat into that". Moyes also confirmed Dominic Calvert-Lewin is close to returning to first-team training.On the prospect of using Jake O'Brien at centre-half he said: "I think Jake is a centre-half so I'm not worried about doing it, that's for sure. It's trying to get the right balance for the team. He has done a brilliant job at full-back so sometimes you've got your decision to make. Do you change two positions or one position? We've got Michael Keane available as well so we've got options and we'll look to play the options between now and the end of the season and find which works best for us."On Bramley-Moore Dock, he said: "My plan was that we'd go to the stadium and maybe do two or three training sessions as well - but they've gone and dug the pitch up. It looks as if I'm not going to get down to the new stadium at all at the moment, which I'm pretty disappointed in, to be honest." He said the modern player is used to playing at stadiums all over and that it is not something "completely strange" to them but "the point is to turn it into your home and feel comfortable and know your surroundings".He also praised their performances in recent games but admitted they're in for a difficult game against Chelsea: "Their home record is good and actually we've not got a great record going to Stamford Bridge over the years either, so from that point of view we know we're up for a tough game. Against Manchester City, Arsenal, Liverpool, I think we've done very well and this period of games has been a difficult one. I go in there with real confidence and belief that we can go and try to make something happen again."Follow all of Friday's Premier League news conferences and the rest of the day's football news Tarkowski's run set to end - how good has he been?published at 11:35 25 April11:35 25 AprilJames Tarkowski is highly likely to miss Everton's trip to Stamford Bridge on Saturday with the hamstring injury that forced him off in the loss against Manchester City last weekend.Tarkowski is on the longest current run of consecutive Premier League appearances, so this injury will break that sequence.He has been a huge influence in the Everton team throughout the season, and the numbers behind his campaign support this.He has currently won the highest proportion of aerial duels (minimum 100 duels) of all players in the Premier League this season (74.64%) ahead of Virgil van Dijk (71.24%) and Dan Burn (67.03%).Tarkwoski also ranks second in the league for number of clearances this season, (209), behind only Nottingham Forest's Murillo (213).17:15 24 AprilNBA great Kidd joins Everton ownership group, published at 17:15 24 AprilNBA great Kidd joins Everton ownership groupAttributionEverton08:03 24 AprilEverton fan granted final wish to see new stadium, published at 08:03 24 AprilEverton fan granted final wish to see new stadiumAttributionLiverpool'It is now all about the future'published at 16:06 23 April16:06 23 AprilIan KennedyBBC Radio Merseyside reporterImage source, Getty ImagesIt perhaps went under the national radar slightly over the weekend, but results finally confirmed Everton were mathematically safe.Of course they had been all but safe for weeks and it was never in real doubt, but worth a mention nevertheless.What a brilliant job David Moyes has done - and his players too, who have stepped up in the second half of the season.There is no disgrace in losing to Manchester City, but yet there was a tinge of disappointment after holding Arsenal and beating Nottingham Forest recently.It is now all about the future - the goodbye to Goodison and the hello to the new stadium.Exciting times ahead and a big summer in terms of contracts and recruitment.But knowing Moyes, he will be putting a big importance on the remaining games of this campaign - starting with another tough one away at Chelsea.It is another chance to gauge where Everton are and where they could be next season.

Three of those players (Idrissa Gana Gueye, Abdoulaye Doucoure and Armando Broja) started on Saturday.The hope is that Gana signs a new deal and assuming Doucoure is happy to take a wage cut, he will be a welcome squad player next season. The jury is certainly out on many others.If Saturday was an audition for both Keane and Broja, they certainly would not be making the cut, with the latter in particular doing little to inspire the manager to make his loan deal permanent.Keane's longstanding Everton career has never really got going. Reliant on those around him, his own confidence and decision-making has been regularly questioned. His introduction on Saturday epitomised the struggles he has had at the club.Moyes will be eager to recruit players that are fit for our impressive new home, improving the quality and overall depth rather than simply padding it out.As the move fast approaches, despite the improved financial position at the club  the free and loan transfer markets will be vital.Find more from Mike Richards at Unholy Trinity, externalEverton 0-2 Man City - the fans' verdictpublished at 09:35 21 April09:35 21 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesWe asked for your thoughts after Saturday's Premier League game between Everton and Man City.Here are some of your comments:Everton fansAlex: Part of me doesn't mind that we lost that match. Credit where credit is due, we were the better team for most of it, and showed great signs of where we could be next season. Let's remember the money Man City has and the value of their players. We held our own for most of the match. Sad to see the brilliant James Tarkowski injured though. Really good performance.David: A disappointing result after such an improvement in recent weeks. However, this will give David Moyes a clearer picture of the major deficiencies we have in the squad when a key player such as Tarkowski goes off injured and we fall away in the final 20 minutes.Gavin: Perfect chance to try out Jarrod Branthwaite and Jake O'Brien in central defencenothing to lose really, but Michael Keane got the nod when Tarkowski got injured and was once again a big disappointment.Man CityColin: Other than two set-pieces it is probably the most controlled we have been at the back. However, going forward needs to be much quicker as highlighted after Jeremy Doku came on. He injected pace and directness which created opportunities.Gene: Nico O'Reilly may be an attacking midfielder, but he defends quite well. He's big, quick and doesn't get pushed around. It's going to be sad to see Kevin de Bruyne leave though as there's no one on this team with his vision and knack for finding the open man. They're still stagnant moving forward and there's not enough aggression. Overall the play is better, which hopefully continues towards the Champions League.Andrew: Trust the academy. James McAtee and Nico O'Reilly are nailed on as part of the senior squad. Plenty more behind plus get a couple back; James Trafford has to be top of the list in summer as Ederson and Stefan Ortega will not improve from here. Then your 'rebuild' is more than half done. Vitor Reis and Claudio Echeverri still settling. All is good!Gossip: Everton set to part ways with Keanepublished at 08:28 21 April08:28 21 AprilEverton will allow 32-year-old centre-back Michael Keane to leave the club when his contract runs out at the end of June.

Read Monday's full gossip columnFollow the gossip column on BBC Sport'Says a lot that we're disappointed to lose to Man City' published at 18:42 19 April18:42 19 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesEverton boss David Moyes talking to Sky Sports: "I thought for 60 minutes we did a lot of good things. I thought we played well in the first half but the injury to James Tarkowski was a big blow to us. It affected the side. It tells you a lot that we're disappointed that we've lost to Manchester City. Ultimately we didn't do well enough in the last 15-20 minutes and that cost us."I don't think the players we brought on today made a big impact on the game like I hoped it would have. It is always going to be difficult against Manchester City. We did a lot of good things. We're just lacking that little bit to be really competitive. We just couldn't find a way today."It is probably quality. Their subs came on and helped them. I'm not sure we had the same. We needed to find a way to get a goal but I genuinely think the injury to James Tarkowski was a big blow to us. It looks like a hamstring injury but what it is we don't know at the moment."We've done an awful lot of good things and we're getting better. It says a lot that we're disappointed to lose 2-0 against Manchester City. I'm sort of smiling that people think we should be disappointed. I am, but we've got to remember how good a side they are."previous pagePage 1 of 41123456…41next pageHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright © 2025 BBC.
