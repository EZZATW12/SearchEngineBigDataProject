We were so determined to win the game, so good!Oscar: What an ending! Yasin Ayari - where do I start? He bossed the midfield and scored a goal to fit his perfect performance. Kaoru Mitoma was an amazing super-sub, using his pace down the wing. Carlos Baleba was in a different position to where he usually plays, but he played it really well. The whole team played amazing to comeback from 1-2 to win 3-2. Just amazing!Tom: An absolutely incredible end to the game. A rollercoaster of emotions; however we cannot rely on late equalisers and winners. We need to build on this result and try to get maximum points. If West Ham hadn't switched off towards the end of the game, we would have gone away with no points. Fabian Hurzeler is a lucky man!Noddy: No goalkeeper in the world would have been able to save those two goals.Chris: A decent 'paper-over-the-cracks' performance at last, but that still can't win over a disappointing season. European football is only a very slim chance given Fulham and Bournemouth are still collecting points, our on and off form and unpredictable player performances. It really has been a wasted run-in so far. A change is needed at the top for next season.West Ham fansSteve: A better performance - very encouraging. We have nothing to play for, admittedly. It's about building for next year now. I think Potter should be given time, I'm starting to see us on the front foot. We move on.Justin: Poor, lacklustre, abysmal! Take your pick. Potter has shown no tactical ability in his starting line-ups or substitutions. The team has shown no signs of improvement under him. I wasn't enamoured by his appointment. To only avoid a relegation battle because the three teams below us are so dire just isn't good enough for a man who was at one time going to be England's new manager.Anthony: We were doing well and then we brought on Vladimir Coufal and he immediately helped Brighton score. It was a poor decision from Potter. They are playing well under him, and gradually improving, but they are either missing scoring opportunities or giving goals away by poor defending. Plenty of work to be done this summer.Rod: Shocking, embarrassing, limp, laughable, clueless and unprofessional. Did I miss anything?Peter: No amount of feeble excuses from Potter will disguise the fact that he has failed to fulfil his mandate.Gossip: West Ham join queue for Davidpublished at 07:3907:39West Ham, Newcastle United, Manchester United, Tottenham, Chelsea, and Liverpool are all interested in signing Canada striker Jonathan David, 25, when his Lille contract expires in the summer - but Marseille are hoping to persuade the player to stay in France.

We did a lot of good things. We have been done by two goals from outside the box. We created chances, scored two goals, but you need to sustain that and that is the challenge for us."Nobody wants to hear about the positives, but there were some over the course of the game.

This is the Premier League, you have to be on it."We have four big games to end the season.

The feeling around London Stadium is that his price will likely rise to a level that would make it counter-productive not to consider a sale.The situation around Kudus is not made easier by the continuing uncertainty over West Ham's other main creative force, Brazil international Lucas Paqueta, whose FA case into betting breaches is still to be concluded.15:55 24 AprilFullkrug West Ham outburst 'not helpful' - Potter, published at 15:55 24 AprilFullkrug West Ham outburst 'not helpful' - PotterAttributionWest HamPotter on Fullkrug's comments, fan frustration and returning to Brightonpublished at 14:17 24 April14:17 24 AprilWest Ham boss Graham Potter has been speaking to the media before Saturday's Premier League game away against Brighton (15:00 BST).Here are the key lines from his news conference:Potter confirmed Edson Alvarez is still sidelined with a back injury but will "hopefully be back next week" while Aaron Wan-Bissaka "should be back". He confirmed that player availability otherwise is the same as against Southampton.He said he "understands the fans' frustrations" at recent results: "We're not playing how we want to play but to look at the bigger picture, it's not so straightforward to change things. You have to accept things and be up for the challenge. I want to support the players, who have been brilliant, and we'll fight together."More on his time in charge so far: "In the 40 or so games before I arrived, the team conceded a lot of goals. The fans are upset of course, and I'm the same, but at the same time we played well at Anfield and have been competitive in all the games."When asked about the Hammers' habit of conceding late goals, Potter said: "It's a number of factors. It's very complicated. When we came in, we were conceding early goals, and now it's late goals, but it's very tough for very different reasons."Potter was asked about Niclas Fullkrug's comments, external after last weekend's draw: "Sometimes you have to understand that after a game, everyone's emotional. It should be that way, but when you're a leader you have to accept the emotion and put things in perspective. Niclas wears his heart on his sleeve and he's entitled to his opinion. For me, it's better to have conversations in private. You have to be able to be honest and to think about the team as well."On Jean-Clair Todibo's difficult campaign: "Injuries play a part. I think he arrived late to pre-season as well. The team's been full of transition. The club invested a lot of money in the summer, but if you look at consistent minutes, it's not been easy. I've enjoyed working with him and he'll continue to get better."On returning to former club Brighton: "I have nothing but respect, love and gratitude for my time there. There were fantastic people, and I have great memories. Obviously I want to win, but I'll always look back fondly on my time there. They're not on a great run now, but that can happen because of various factors."Follow all of Thursday's Premier League news conferences and the rest of the day's football newsFullkrug's comments 'just the tip of the iceberg'published at 09:34 24 April09:34 24 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesIn some ways, Graham Potter's start at West Ham has gone under the radar because the bottom three have been as bad as they are and we have the storyline of Wolves becoming one of the form sides in the division.It is not necessarily a wasted season, but it is a hugely disappointing one for the supporters. With the players that signed, there would have been a belief this team could be half decent again.They won the Conference League and were pushing for Champions League spots. When Declan Rice was there, he talked about their disappointment of not qualifying.Now though, the fans want the season to end and they want Potter to do something in the summer, whether that is bringing in players or really coaching them up to a better standard. They need next season to be more exciting and to have something to believe in.Niclas Fullkrug caused a stir with his post-match comments after the drab draw with Southampton but I do not mind that as long as that is who he is generally.He was speaking as if the manager believed in what he was saying as well. The comments are likely the consequence of the manager saying similar to the players, which is why Fullkrug felt the right to be able to say that in front of the cameras.I do not mind someone delivering passion. I do not think there would be many in that squad who would argue what he is saying is essentially wrong.The mentality of players can be very different in key moments and as a consequence, if you're not united, it can be quite disappointing.It was off the back of an unacceptable result so there is lots of emotion tied in.After they scored one, they would be anticipating scoring more so I get it. He probably said it in the dressing room already. There are some players who come in and, even if they have not been there for a long time, because they have leadership qualities, when they speak, people listen.It is just about the balance and, if what he is saying is true, you can try and push back against it, but he's going to explain why he thinks you are wrong.I do not think it will cause any more friction in the squad because there is going to be disappointment and disagreements already. After the game, there will have been shouting and arguments - then things calm down and people select what they say to the broadcasters.Fullkrug's comments will not be anything new. I am sure from the way he is outspoken in front of a camera, he is also very outspoken on the pitch and in the dressing room. What he said to the media will just be the tip of the iceberg.Nedum Onuoha was speaking to BBC Sport's Nat HaywardGetting rid of Moyes 'still the right decision'published at 12:34 23 April12:34 23 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesThe Sun journalist Jack Rosser still believes West Ham were right to get rid of David Moyes at the end of last season.The Hammers are 17th in the table under Graham Potter, whereas last season the club finished ninth.Since starting a second spell at Everton in January, Moyes has taken the club to 13th in the table, winning five and drawing six of his 14 league games.Speaking on BBC Radio Sussex's Albion Unlimited podcast to preview West Ham's game at Brighton on Saturday, Rosser said: "Ten or 15 games feel like 100 games at the moment. There hasn't been loads to get excited about. There was the result against Arsenal."Not because of Graham Potter, but it's been a difficult season. There was a lot to do in the summer in terms of moving on from David Moyes. That was still the right decision - a lot of people thought it had run its course."What he's doing now at Everton doesn't help. No-one really saw where West Ham are coming. I think they're at their lowest position at this point of the season since they last got relegated."Everything this season has rested on Jarrod Bowen. They've had injury problems - , Niclas Fullkrug being a big one, while Crysencio Summerville has had a lot of time out, Bowen a bit of time out and Luas Paqueta has had his FA spot-fixing case hanging over him all season and not played to the level West Ham fans know he can reach."A lot of people are just waiting for next season. Southampton are one of the worst teams in Premier League history. If you can't go out and put them to the sword then there really are problems."Difficult and hard to watch is the story of the season."You can listen to the full chat hereGossip: Saudi Pro League side eye Kuduspublished at 07:34 23 April07:34 23 AprilWest Ham and Ghana winger Mohammed Kudus, 24, is a top target for Saudi Pro League club Al-Nassr.Want more transfer stories? Read Wednesday's full gossip column Follow the gossip column on BBC SportFullkrug outburst 'shows he cares' published at 12:36 22 April12:36 22 AprilJames JonesFan writerImage source, Getty ImagesNiclas Fullkrug's post-match outburst after West Ham's 1-1 draw with Southampton on Saturday has shone a huge spotlight on our struggles under Graham Potter.Fullkrug's rant hit differently and has been met with widespread praise among an equally angry and frustrated fanbase. Not because he had every right to say what he said and not because everything he said was correct, but because it showed that he cares and it displayed the very kind of mentality the rest of his team-mates should have.Fullkrug is an elite footballer. He is a Germany international and less than 12 months ago he was starting a Champions League final for Borussia Dortmund. Yes, his maiden season in England has been blighted by injuries, but the impact he has had on the team since his return to full fitness shows just how good he can be.So for a player like him to make such a public outburst speaks volumes for how bad things are within the dressing room right now.He will not be used to this. Fullkrug is used to winning. He is used to playing with players who carry the same focus and the same mindset to succeed at the very top. It is no surprise he is angry with his team-mates for failing to beat one of the worst teams the Premier League has ever seen. It was not just a failure to beat them - it was a struggle to even get going for much of the 90 minutes. Simply not good enough.The hope is that his words will have given some of his team-mates the rocket they so desperately need.You can count on one hand the West Ham players who can genuinely hold their heads high this season. The fact Fullkrug is one of them despite his injury problems says a lot.Jarrod Bowen, the captain, is another. Beyond that, there are not many who can honestly say they have given everything for the shirt this term.It was not long ago fans were hoping the club would cash in on Fullkrug in the summer. Now we should be desperately hoping he stays, because it is that kind of passion, that win-at-all-costs mentality and that brutal honesty West Ham need to truly get back to where we were under David Moyes.Hopefully this is the wake-up call the players needed, but something tells me it runs much deeper than what we see on the surface.Find more from James Jones at We Are West Ham, externalWest Ham 1-1 Southampton - the fans' verdictpublished at 11:38 21 April11:38 21 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesWe asked for your thoughts after Saturday's Premier League game between West Ham and Southampton.Here are some of your comments:West Ham fansIan: Another disappointing performance after a promising display at Anfield last week. There is a complete lack of cohesion especially the midfield three. James Ward-Prowse and Carlos Soler are not good enough and this is where we need to improve next season with younger and hungrier players. I don't blame Graham Potter as these are not his players but these performances have been going on for some time under different managers and a major construction of the team is urgently required in the summer.Chris: Too many inconsistent and underperforming players. Slack defenders, a lack of mobility in midfield, and unfit and misfiring forwards for about two years now. Can't just blame the managers. The recruitment and squad have been equally to blame.Ken: In a poor season for West Ham, this result has got to be the most embarrassing yet. I believe Potter can do a good job next season but has got to get seven or eight players out in the summer break and try to find better replacements. There are too many players who don't have the Hammers pride.Southampton fansColin: A better performance, we never gave up and were unlucky not to win. A crying need for a regular goalscorer. Let's hope we can get a few more points.Stuart: So happy to get a point. Just wish our luck would be that little bit better. So many times we have been in the game, only for luck, and then confidence to desert us.  But we left it all out there and that's all I can ask.  Let's now see if we can get one more win before this season ends.Steve: The best football Southampton have played all season is when Simon Rusk has been in charge. They could do a lot worse than giving him a permanent crack at it in the Championship next year.previous pagePage 1 of 42123456…42next pageHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright © 2025 BBC.
