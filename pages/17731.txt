Joseph Woodward and Freddie Steward combined to find the 27-year-old in space for his first try.He took full advantage when the visitors were reduced to 13, cutting in past Cadan Murley for his second before having a third ruled out after replays showed the faintest of knock-ons from Woodward, as the ball then hit the corner flag and bounced back into play for Radwan to score.But he saved the best until last, picking up the ball in the middle before accelerating away from Quins pursuers and skipping past the challenge of Green to claim a stunning hat-trick.Hassell-Collins was his efficient best on the left, finishing after Jack van Poortvliet had burst through from the back of the scrum and then adding his second when Woodward found him in space with clear turf to run into.By the time Liebenberg added his side's sixth, Leicester had long since put the result to bed.Quins punished for costly mistakesImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Harlequins struggled to break through Leicester and conceded six triesThis was a day when nothing went right for Harlequins.Tigers prop Heyes accidently trod on Smith's ankle early in the game, and the England man played the rest of his match with heavy strapping on his leg.Anderson's first yellow card came halfway through the first half when he collided with Steward after the Leicester full-back had jumped up to collect a high ball.The away side were made to pay as Hassell-Collins got on the scoresheet just inside the 10 minutes.Anderson was guilty of the same offence on the same player in the second half except this time the Quins wing took a big hit to the head which appeared to knock him out instantly, with the TMO opting not to show the challenge on the screens.After a long delay, Anderson was taken off the field to applause from both sets of fans and the red card was confirmed.Yet Harlequins were reduced to 13 players a minute later as Green was adjudged to have deliberately knocked on in a challenge.In the end it was a comfortable victory for Leicester that will leave the Twickenham-based side up to 10 points off fourth place with three matches of the season remaining.Anderson 'OK' after head injury - reactionLeicester Tigers head coach Michael Cheika told BBC Radio Leicestershire:"Overall from a club point of view [it's] points in our pocket, big full house crowd enjoying the day."From a coaching point of view, not as successful as I would have liked. I thought in the first half we were poor, in some areas which were important to our game, and we had to have a discussion about it at half-time."And then second half I thought we definitely brought that and that laid the platform for us getting some scores."I'm happy for the day and how it turned out but I'd like to see us come out of the blocks with a little bit more as far as the quality we want to bring to games every week."On Harlequins red and yellow cards: "First and foremost it's good news that young Anderson's OK, I went and saw him as soon as I came off the field because that looked pretty bad, it's certainly not intentional from his point of view, he just got mixed up."What I did like was we took some simple opportunities, [rugby] football's not a complicated game sometimes - you've got three on two down that side, go and take that side and execute it."We did focus at that time and so you should, you've got that advantage and you want to take it."I want us to be better, it's still so tight. Everything's going to count from here on in."On Adam Radwan: "He's really blended in super quickly. He's loving his footy here and he's really enjoying things, he's a great fella off the field and he's playing well on the field."Harlequins head coach Danny Wilson said:"Cam is OK. He's back on his feet but was out for a while. It was a nasty one and he will be out for a period of time."On Marcus Smith's injury: "It's his ankle. We don't know how bad at the moment but he showed his toughness by digging in as he always does. Unfortunately it got worse and at the end he was struggling to be able to execute and will have a scan."It was a bit of a perfect storm, when you are struggling with injuries before the game and you go and get yellows and reds and further injuries it can lead to a scoreboard getting away from you and that is what happened today. "But we can still mathematically get top four."Leicester: Steward; Radwan, Kata, Woodward, Hassell-Collins; Pollard, Van Poortvliet; Smith, Montoya, Heyes, Henderson, Chessum, Liebenberg, Reffell, HatherellReplacements: Clare, Whitcombe, Cole, Wells, Ilione, Youngs, Shillcock, KellyHarlequins: Green; Anderson, Beard, Northmore, Murley; Smith, Gjaltema; Baxter, Walker, Lamositele, Herbst, Hammond, Cunningham-South, Kenningham, DombrandtReplacements: Jibulu, Jones, Lewis, Launchbury, Lawday, W Evans, Murray, BensonSin-bin: Anderson [21 mins], Green [45 mins]Red card: Anderson [44 mins]Referee: Anthony Woodthorpe.Related topicsRugby UnionLeicester TigersHarlequinsComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 157Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8781 viewing8.8k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published13 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
