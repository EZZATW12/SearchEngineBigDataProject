He's put in a good shift there. He was brilliant but you have to look after him."These are boys you have to protect for themselves. He and the likes of [Luke] Cowan-Dickie are pushing for Lions honours, and they richly deserve it if you're just going on that game."They are naming the squad soon for Australia but you'd like to think Tom will have a chance."We have a great pack. Asher Opoku-Fordjour was outstanding too. He's so powerful. That will set him apart from other tightheads. But you still have to do the bread and butter in mauling and scrummaging."George Ford was outstanding in the windy conditions. He controlled the game."Sale fly-half George Ford said: "It's a huge win but there are still four massive games remaining, so plenty of work still to be done."We knew we could cause them problems. I have to use my guys as weapons in the right areas of the field and it worked well today. "We know what we can do given the time and openings. We wanted to defend well and remain disciplined."Harlequins head coach Danny Wilson said:"There are still four games and 20 points left to play for, so we will continue to fight. "We have [Leicester] Tigers next and need to patch ourselves up and learn from this result and move on."Harlequins: Green; Anderson, Beard, Northmore, Murley; Smith, Care; Baxter, Walker, Lamositele, Herbst, Cunningham-South, Kenningham, Evans, Dombrandt.Replacements: Jibulu, Els, Jones, Launchbury, Lawday, Gjaltema, Benson, Waghorn.Sale: Carpenter; Roebuck, R du Preez, Ma'asi-White, Reed; Ford, Warr; Rodd, Cowan-Dickie, Opoku-Fordjour, Bamber, Hill, Van Rhyn, T Curry, JL du Preez.Replacements: McElroy, McIntyre, John, Dugdale, Andrews, Quirke, Bedlow, Wills.Referee: Matthew Carley.Related topicsSaleRugby UnionHarlequinsComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 81Top storiesLive. Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win - latest & reaction11330 viewing11k viewingLive. World Snooker Championship - live text13844 viewing14k viewingNational power outage stops play at Madrid OpenPublished9 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
