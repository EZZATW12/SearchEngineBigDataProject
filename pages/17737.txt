The young Cambridge University graduate scored 13 second-half points to earn the  Player of the Match award when Quins beat Saracens at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium last month. "I have been at the club since I was 13 years old. It's my boyhood club and I have been coming to The Stoop from a young age," Benson told the club website."Coming out of university and being in the programme full-time for the first time has been a big step up in standard - I've made my Premiership debut and earned a few more appearances, so I'm pleased so far."I'm very lucky to have Nick Evans as one of my coaches at the club and to work closely with Marcus (Smith) and Jarrod (Evans) daily. "They have great rugby minds so I am just trying to absorb as much as I can and get better every day."Quins have not disclosed the length of the former England under-20 international's deal. "He's an intelligent rugby player and he's very accurate off the kicking tee, which is hugely important for every 10," Harlequins head coach Danny Wilson added.  "We have a strong group of fly-halves at the club, it's great to see how they learn from each other every day and push one another on the training pitch."We're delighted Jamie will continue his journey at Harlequins as we work closely with him to fulfil his bright potential."Related topicsRugby UnionHarlequinsTop storiesLive. Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win - latest & reaction11330 viewing11k viewingLive. World Snooker Championship - live text13844 viewing14k viewingNational power outage stops play at Madrid OpenPublished10 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
