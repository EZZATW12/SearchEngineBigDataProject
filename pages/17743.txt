"Their ball skills and movement, and they play smart. I've never known rucks like it. "We were poor but they were next level. If they don't win it all now, it's a travesty."The 38-year-old added: "You look at their squad and it's incredible, there's no way English teams can compete with that. "About 10 of those Leinster lads would probably start for the [British and Irish] Lions or be in the Test squad. We can't compete."Could format change help Premiership clubs?Monye suggested a "greater sense of equity" that might enable English clubs to perform better could be achieved by condensing the Champions Cup format to limit the frequency of in-season jumps between domestic, European and international competitions."In three or four weeks between October and November you can have Gallagher Premiership into Champions Cup into Autumn Nations series," he said of the calendar format. "Then you have a couple weekends of Premiership, back to Europe, Six Nations, back to the Premiership, then Europe (again). It makes it really hard to follow."He continued: "If you could condense all of those weekends into one block in the season, it's easier to follow and actually makes the tournament more valuable for broadcasters."And to close the gap financially, I would allow the Premiership teams to recruit a marquee player - or just say you have a marquee spend for Europe, say £1m. That's one way to match with the very best, to close that gap in quality."Saints England's last Champions Cup hopeNorthampton's European form comes in stark contrast to their stuttering domestic campaign, with the defending Premiership champions currently sitting eighth in the English top flight.Having cruised past Clermont Auvergne and into the last eight on Friday, Saints take on Castres in the Champions Cup this Saturday, with Bordeaux facing Munster the same day.That follows Leinster against Glasgow on Friday, with Toulon versus Toulouse concluding the quarter-final ties on Sunday. The semi-finals are then slated for the beginning of May.Saints - whose only previous Champions Cup victory came 25 years ago - have not progressed past the semis since 2011, but are looking to become the Premiership's first winners since Exeter in 2020.Quarter-finals (ties to be played 11/12/13 April):Friday: Leinster v Glasgow Warriors (20:00 BST)Saturday: Bordeaux v Munster (15:00 BST)Saturday: Northampton Saints v Castres (17:30 BST)Sunday: Toulon v Toulouse (15:00 BST)Semi-finals (ties to be played 2/3/4 May):Bordeaux/Munster v Toulon/ToulouseLeinster/Glasgow v Northampton/CastresRelated topicsSaleSaracensRugby UnionLeicester TigersHarlequinsComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 689Top storiesLive. Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win - latest & reaction11302 viewing11k viewingLive. World Snooker Championship - live text13967 viewing14k viewingNational power outage stops play at Madrid OpenPublished10 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
