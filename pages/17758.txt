If there is a doubt about him, we won't consider him for next weekend. I don't have anything specific to report, but at least he had a smile at the end."We're very chuffed about the five points. We knew that this was a big moment in the season in terms of two games after the Six Nations, both at home. This was a very good Quins team that had just beaten Saracens. We anticipated that they would bring their power game, which they did."It was a cracking atmosphere at The Rec. It just seemed a lot louder than last week. It was two teams again that wanted to play positive rugby and that is a trademark of this Premiership. We started the first 25 minutes fantastically well, to be 26-0 up. We scored tries and scrambled well. We just keep doing what we are doing."But as I have said on many occasions we will only see at the back end of May where we are at. There are five rounds left so we can just keep focusing on what we need to do and keep trying to improve. But we're obviously satisfied with 10 league points from the last two weeks. Now it's back into Europe.''This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Bath head coach Johann van Graan: "It was a professional performance."Bath winger Will Muir told BBC Radio Bristol:"It was a battle. I talked to a few of the lads and we thought it must be coming to half-time and it was only 12 minutes in. "It's never easy against them. You know that they never roll over. It felt like a relief to get it over the line really. They're so dangerous when they throw it about, you can never really switch off."Tom de Glanville assisted both of my tries, I owe him a pint after this."You look at the table, there are eight or nine teams who could finish in the top four, so every game is massive."
