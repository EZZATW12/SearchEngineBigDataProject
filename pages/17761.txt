"I cannot thank the board, staff, players, and supporters enough for creating so many memories and friendships for my family and myself. "I will continue to support everyone at the club and drive all areas forward until the end of the season."'A consistent cog in a coaching carousel' - analysisBBC Sport rugby union reporter Mike Henson:Billy Millard had been a consistent cog in a Harlequins coaching carousel and his partnership with defence coach and fellow Australian Jason Gilmore seemed to be bearing fruit this season.Quins pushed into the top four and closed in on a first post-season play-off appearance since 2022 as they beat Saracens at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Saturday.However, he has been on a long list of names linked with the director of rugby role at the Welsh Rugby Union and it might be that a role away from the day-to-day demands of club rugby has its appeal. As head of a coaching cooperative which oversaw Quins' sensational, stylish title win in 2021, in the wake of Paul Gustard's departure, he will always be guaranteed a warm welcome at The Stoop.Related topicsRugby UnionHarlequinsTop storiesLive. Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win - latest & reaction10386 viewing10k viewingLive. World Snooker Championship - live text12866 viewing13k viewingNational power outage stops play at Madrid OpenPublished10 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
