A quick break up field later with his side were defending their goalline, George's quick tap penalty caught them napping with Theo McFarland barging over.It was typical of Harlequins first-half performance – possession, territory, followed by mistake, forward pass or knock on. And when brilliantly quick hands from Alex Goode fed Fergus Burke and Tobias Elliott who went over in the corner to give a 12-0 lead just before the break, it looked like it was going to be a long day for Quins.However, the second half proved to be the opposite of the first, with Saracens forced into mistakes and Quins dominant.Wilson had shuffled his pack at half-time and threw the ace on to the table in Benson, whose nerveless kicking display turned the match in Quins' favour.Oscar Beard's break and inside pass on the hour mark was finished off by Waghorn, a try converted by Benson from just to the left of the posts to make it 12-7.Saracens were immediately handed a chance to stretch their lead to eight points when referee Adam Leal penalised dissent from Quins and moved a penalty 10 metres nearer from halfway.But, in what proved to be a pivotal moment, Alex Lozowski missed from 40 metres.Benson made no mistake when Sarries were penalised at the breakdown five minutes later, banging it over low from 40 metres on 68 minutes to put Quins within two points. And when black shirts were adjudged to have not rolled away after another three minutes had elapsed, he did it again from five metres further out.If a one-point advantage at 13-12 still felt precarious, a penalty for a dangerous tackle from Lozowski delivered another chance for Benson which he kicked to make it 16-12. Porter's last-minute converted try delivered what, in the end, was a comfortable victory.The win lifted Quins into fourth place in the Premiership table with six matches of the season remaining, while Saracens are seventh, two points off a play-off spot.Resting international players 'worked for us' - reactionSaracens director of rugby Mark McCall told BBC Radio London:"We spent a lot of time down our end but I was pleased with how we defended and we obviously had a good lead at half-time. But there were things in our game like our lineout and the crumbs you get off the kicking game, where they were the dominant team in those areas."We were trying to play off scraps and we made the wrong choices at times but things which are normally very strong parts of our game were not quite on point today and it cost us."We have clear things we have to get better at. We have to understand why we were poor today. It is a bit of a test for us as a group. It doesn't have to be the end of anything there are six games to go and it is on all of us to work really hard."Harlequins head coach Danny Wilson told PA Sport: "I'm really proud of this group considering a few people would have had something to say about not selecting our three internationals and giving them the week off."Last season we put too much pressure on our internationals to return. Think about what the Six Nations is for an international rugby player – physically, mentally and the big one we all forget is emotionally."So we felt give them a rest straight away regardless of who we are playing. I know it doesn't work for everyone, but it worked for us."It's been 13 years since we beat Saracens away and we have done the double on them this season, which is massive."Now we have to back it up. We have got Bath away and Leinster away. To come out of here with points is vital, but now let's see what we can do."Saracens: Daly; Elliott, Lozowski, Tompkins, Segun; Burke, Van Zyl; Mawi, George, Riccioni, Itoje (capt), Tizard, McFarland, Gonzalez, Willis.Replacements: Dan, Brantingham, Clarey, Isiekwe, Onyeama-Christie, Michelow, Simpson, Goode.Harlequins: Halfpenny; Isgro, Beard, Waghorn, David; J Evans, Porter; Jones, Walker, Lamositele, Launchbury, Lewies, Kenningham, W Evans, Dombrandt (capt).Replacements: Riley, Els, Hobson, Herbst, Hammond, Murray, Benson, Green.Referee: Adam LealRelated topicsSaracensRugby UnionHarlequinsComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 210Top storiesLive. Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win - latest & reaction10386 viewing10k viewingLive. World Snooker Championship - live text12866 viewing13k viewingNational power outage stops play at Madrid OpenPublished10 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
