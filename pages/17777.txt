Last year for us and Northampton to get to a semi-final was remarkable."If one of us could do it again this year it would be nothing short of a miracle, but we'll try our best and see what happens."Listen: Sport's Strangest Crimes - BloodgateListen to the latest Rugby Union Weekly podcastImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Care has played more than 250 times for HarlequinsThe tournament has been won by an English club on 10 occasions since it was launched in 1995-96 under the previous name of the Heineken Cup.Since Exeter Chiefs beat Racing 92 in the final at Ashton Gate in 2019-20, the trophy has been claimed by a French club in each of the subsequent four years, with no English finalists in that time.Harlequins have never won the tournament in their history, while London rivals Saracens are the most successful English club in the competition with three titles, the last in 2019.Sarries visit three-time champions Toulon in the last 16, while Sale Sharks face a trip to holders Toulouse.Leicester Tigers visit Glasgow Warriors and Northampton host Clermont Auvergne at Franklin's Gardens in the first of the last-16 ties.Harlequins are currently sixth in the Premiership table, three points behind fourth-placed Leicester with seven matches remaining.Care announced in January he would remain with Harlequins next season for his 20th year with the club.He has won two Premiership titles with the club and said he would love to add to his collection before hanging up his boots."[I'm] Not [planning on playing for] much longer. I'm still really enjoying my rugby, I love the club, I always said I'd never pack it in until I didn't feel I could help the team, or I wasn't enjoying it," he added."I'd love to help the club lift another trophy before I stop. Whether that be this year or next year, I'm not sure but I'll try my best to help these young lads reach their goals and reach their dreams."Related topicsSaleNorthampton SaintsSaracensRugby UnionLeicester TigersHarlequinsLast season's semi-finalsToulouse battle past Quins to reach Champions Cup finalPublished5 May 2024Leinster beat Saints to make Euro final with Lowe treblePublished4 May 2024Comments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 192Top storiesLive. Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win - latest & reaction10402 viewing10k viewingLive. World Snooker Championship - live text12943 viewing13k viewingNational power outage stops play at Madrid OpenPublished10 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
