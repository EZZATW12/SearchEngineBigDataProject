I feel sorry for the fans. I hold my hands up and apologise. I should have scored at least one of them chances."As a team, we did not start well. That is what we wanted to do. Then in the second half, we came out fighting and we gave it absolutely everything."The support never stopped until the very last second and we thank the fans for that because they have been so consistent with us throughout the season."I'm lost for words really, I'm sad to go out like that. We gave it our everything but we keep going. We have still got the Premier League to focus on."On his first chance: "I've never hit a ball as sweetly on my weak foot in my life. As soon as that hit the crossbar, I knew it wasn't going to be our day."On his second chance: "I should score that one. I go around the goalkeeper and if I score that, it gives everyone in the stadium energy to try and go again. Even though we were 2-0 down, we showed resilience and kept fighting. That is the main thing."I think if we get a goal, then we get another one. That was just the flow of the game  at that moment. We had a few good chances that we didn't make the most of and all I can put that down to is that it wasn't our day."We have a game plan that everyone believes in and sticks to. We executed it well in the first half. We nullified them, apart from their goal, and the main thing is that we came out fighting in the second half."Anthony [Elanga] is a big threat for us and he showed that in the second half. We've got to put this behind us now and focus on the league - five big finals. We are going to give it our absolute everything and hope for the best."19:14 27 April'A lot to fight for', says Forest boss Nuno.

Manchester City started the game much better than ourselves and they were really clinical. We played a good game - we did well, competed well and had our chances. We knew how hard it was going to be, but we gave it our all."It is important to take the positives. After the sadness and bad humour goes away, and you look back at the game, it makes us stronger for the future."On whether he should have started Anthony Elanga: "We had a lot of situations to decide. It was not an easy week to put the team together. We never know."We had a game plan, but everything changed in terms of the goal we conceded. But the way we responded and reacted was really positive."On their Premier League run-in and the race for European football: "When the sadness fades and the fans go back to Nottingham and they wake up tomorrow, they will see that we still have a lot to fight for."We will give it our all. We will try."19:01 27 April'Unlucky' Forest hit woodwork three times in second half.

The Reds exit this season's competition with just one win in five games (D3 L1), having progressed from all three previous rounds through penalty shootouts (against Exeter City, Ipswich Town and Brighton).Nuno Espirito Santo's side failed to attempt a shot in the first half at Wembley, making it just the second half of football all season where they have not had at least one shot (previously against Liverpool in September 2024).Zach Abbott (18 years and 349 days) was the youngest player to start an FA Cup game at Wembley since Marcus Rashford (18 years and 203 days) for Manchester United in the 2016 final against Crystal Palace.Nottingham Forest 0-2 Man City - send us your thoughtspublished at 18:24 27 April18:24 27 AprilWere you at the game or following from elsewhere?Have your say on Nottingham Forest's performanceWhat did you make of Man City's display?Come back to this page on Monday to find a selection of your repliesFollow Sunday's FA Cup semi-final livepublished at 15:20 27 April15:20 27 AprilThe second FA Cup semi-final of the weekend takes place on Sunday live from Wembley and BBC Sport will bring you every kick.Nottingham Forest v Manchester City (16:30)Listen to the match on BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra hereFollow all of the action and reaction hereSutton's predictions: Nottingham Forest v Man Citypublished at 12:19 27 April12:19 27 AprilPep Guardiola's team selection will be absolutely crucial here.Both of Manchester City's goals against Aston Villa on Tuesday came from their players being prepared to run at defenders - firstly Omar Marmoush and then Jeremy Doku, who had started the game on the bench.But Pep appears to be very cautious at the moment, and has not been using his out-and-out wingers, Doku or Savinho, very much because he wants to try to control the middle of the pitch.Doku and Savinho both started when Forest beat City at the beginning of March, which was City's last defeat, seven games ago, but it's unlikely that they will both start at Wembley.That does not make this tie any easier to call, though.Forest bounced back from a couple of defeats with a win over Tottenham on Monday, which was a huge result for their top-five hopes, and we know the way they are set up to counter-attack can cause City problems.I am not just saying this because Forest were my boyhood team, but I want anyone but City to win the FA Cup this season.I've got nothing against City but it would be a great story if any of the other three teams won it because they have either not won anything for so long or, in Crystal Palace's case, they have never won a major trophy at all.Despite that, I just have a feeling that City are going to put in a good performance here, and earn the right to reach their third straight FA Cup final.As much I hate to say it, I am expecting Pep to find a way to win, the same way they did against Everton and Aston Villa - although I hope I am wrong. My predictions are so bad at the moment, there is a good chance I will be.Sutton's prediction: 1-2Read the full predictions and have your say here'The fans will have a huge part to play'published at 15:34 26 April15:34 26 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesFormer defender Steve Cook believes Nottingham Forest will have a "fan advantage" over Manchester City at Wembley in their FA Cup semi-final.On BBC Radio Nottingham's Shut Up And Show More Football podcast, he spoke about his experience playing for Forest at Wembley in the 2022 Championship play-off final against Huddersfield Town.Cook said: "We knew the atmosphere would be leaning in our favour, and I think that will be the same on Sunday."The Forest players will know they have a fan advantage and it's huge. When we walked out it was like a home match, but bigger and better."The fans will have a huge part to play. They played a big part in the play-off final. They'll know because every home match they turn up, and you've seen how well the players have responded to it."The players in the play-off final knew how much it meant, and the players now will know."You can listen to the full podcast hereNottingham Forest v Man City: Did you know?published at 11:30 26 April11:30 26 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesSince the 2021-22 campaign, Ryan Yates has had a hand in eight FA Cup goals in 13 games for Nottingham Forest (four goals, four assists), five more than any other player.

From a club perspective, they wont want this to be the culmination. They'll want 17 May, the final, or the qualification for the Champions League. That would be the culmination. But certainly this is one of the huge steps Forest have taken this season."We have talked about 'next steps' and this is another step for Forest, their first semi-final at the new Wembley. It is another example of how far Forest have come this season, and who knows what is to come after Sunday."Listen to the full episode on BBC SoundsThe answerpublished at 16:55 25 April16:55 25 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesEarlier, we asked you to name the current Nottingham Forest player from a series of clues.The correct answer is Willy Boly.Impossible to shield Forest players from FA Cup glare - Nunopublished at 15:15 25 April15:15 25 AprilNick MashiterBBC Sport football news reporterImage source, Getty ImagesBoss Nuno Espirito Santo knows it is "impossible" to ignore the scale of Nottingham Forest's FA Cup semi final against Manchester City.Forest face City in their first FA Cup semi-final since 1991 on Sunday as they look to continue their outstanding season. They sit third in the Premier League with five games remaining in the race for the Champions League.Either Crystal Palace or Aston Villa await in the final as Nuno looks to keep his squad focused. He said: "It's the same, we have to look at the game as the same. The approach is exactly the same, you don't have to shield them, it's impossible to shield a squad when there's so much information. "We have to go as a group of players and staff to compete. That's the best way to enjoy a semi final, to compete."Neco Williams and captain Ryan Yates are banned for the game but will travel with the squad Nuno added: "They can do whatever they can, all the squad is going to travel. There's going to be a moment where we are all together. They have to give a hand outside of the pitch."'Champions League is bigger' than winning FA Cuppublished at 12:04 26 April12:04 26 AprilFormer Nottingham Forest striker Robert Earnshaw says Champions League football next season is more important to the Reds than one day of celebration in the FA Cup.He joins Ben Croucher and former Premier League midfielder Michael Brown on The Football News Show to look ahead to Sunday's semi-final...This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch The Football News Show on BBC iPlayerNuno on desire to 'compete' and his pride for a 'happy' citypublished at 14:31 25 April14:31 25 AprilNottingham Forest boss Nuno Espirito Santo has been speaking to the media before Sunday's FA Cup semi-final against Manchester City on Sunday (16:30 BST)Here are the key lines from his news conference:Nuno is "proud" to be taking Forest to an FA Cup semi-final: "We cannot thank (the fans) enough. There's a lot going. That shows the support of the fans, the city is happy. What can I say to them? Sing as high as you can."The Forest boss is dealing with injuries going into the match against City: "We have a lot of concerns. We are assessing players day by day and players coming back. There's still tomorrow to go. Moreno the same and players who have had issues from previous games."Nuno is treating Sunday's match no different to any other: "Inside our preparation, this game is not different form any other one. We have retained our normal cycle of preparation. It's a special occasion and we have to enjoy it. It is the same approach. I am delighted we are going to Wembley to compete in a good team. It's a long journey, a stressful one, we have to compete and go and play."Chris Wood's return to goalscoring form is a positive: "I believe the game against Everton was hard, he was back to competing and did a good game. We felt Chris was comfortable and there's always improvement."Monday's Premier League win at Tottenham gives Forest confidence going into the run-in: "It helps a lot, the best way to prepare for the matches is when you perform well from the previous one. We bounced back from previous performances and the players are confident."Nuno wants his team to give it everything they have to reach the FA Cup final: "It's the same, we have to look at the game as the same. The approach is exactly the same, you don't have to shield them, it's impossible to shield a squad when there's much information. We have to go as a group of players and staff to compete.

So, if you were in the changing room 15 minutes before the off, what would you say to the players?Send your words here'We can't overthink it' - Yatespublished at 11:39 25 April11:39 25 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesNottingham Forest captain Ryan Yates on missing the FA Cup semi-final against Manchester City through suspension: "I try not to think about it too much. It's part and parcel. They just need to change the rules - a couple of bookings is normal for me. I'm sure the lads are going to get through it and I can have the final."It's going to be so special. You have to enjoy these occasions. We can't overthink it. That's not what the manager is like, Nuno is so consistent with our processes. We will treat it like any other game but knowing there is that extra little bit of excitement and anticipation."BBC Radio Nottingham's Colin Fray offered plenty on the looming fixture, stating: "Manchester City have been to the new Wembley 28 times. When you think about it, it is almost a full Premier League season of matches since the new Wembley was built. The other thing is six of their most recent visits have been FA Cup semi-finals. This is their seventh FA Cup semi-final in a row, so they are very used to this occasion."For Forest, first one at the new Wembley, first semi since 1991. Forest fans have waited a lifetime for an occasion like we will see on Sunday. That might just give Forest an edge to nullify City's experience. You never know. You never know before any Wembley game because it's about who adapts the better to the wide open spaces, the torrent of noise that we know will come from the Forest fans. It's just intriguing."Listen to Shut Up And Show More Football featuring interviews with Yates, Jota Silva and experts on the FA Cup semi-final'This is a dream for any kid'published at 09:54 25 April09:54 25 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesNottingham Forest winger Jota Silva has given a rare interview and told the Shut Up And Show More Football podcast he is living a "dream" this season.The 25-year-old, who has vastly improved his English in recent months, told the BBC Radio Nottingham podcast: "I think it's a great season. It's incredible to be here and help the team play this football. In England, this football, it's incredible."For me, this is perfect for me and the club. I am very happy to be here. I worked a lot to try to be here so now I arrive and I try to do my best on the pitch, play with my passion that I have for this sport."If the coach says he needs me for 90 minutes, I play. If he needs me for five minutes I try for five minutes, try to impact the game and bring energy from the bench. For me the most important is to help the team and do my job."We are in the position we are because we don't have a team, we have a squad, a family here. Like the coach said, what we can achieve this season is so special so we work hard every day to achieve this."One of the words to describe this team is belief. In the FA Cup games, sometimes you score and go to extra time or penalties and you need belief in ourselves and team-mates. I think this is the word to describe this team, belief and passion."For me to play here in the Premier League and FA Cup is a dream. You have the Champions League and Premier League, FA Cup, every cup in this country is so special. We believe in ourselves and our work and we can improve every day."And, on the prospect of running out at Wembley, the summer signing said: "This is a dream for any kid and any person playing football.

You'd have said, 'no chance.'"They've just got players that have been on form. Elanga's been incredible, Callum Hudson-Odoi, Chris Wood has produced the goals that he's produced. I think the commentator the other night said a very good thing that they've kept the team fit for most of the year. They've not been, touch wood, hit with a lot of injuries."Former Premier League midfielder Michael Brown said: "I tell you who's done well, Kyle. Ola Aina, the right-back. He looks so comfortable and calm and like, in one-v-one situations he just goes, like, 'Go on then...let's go. Take me on!'"Walker added: "He plays left and right back. He's so quick. I was impressed with him a couple of years back when I played against him and just his calmness on the ball, how he defended in the one-v-one situations. You know, he would definitely get my vote for being either left or right back for the team this season, which is fully deserved."Listen to The Kyle Walker Podcast hereprevious pagePage 1 of 41123456…41next pageHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright © 2025 BBC.
