Harlequins is a fantastic club where I've made lifelong friends and unforgettable memories," he said. "I wish I could have finished this season stronger, but unfortunately, injury hasn't allowed it. I'm working hard to get back fit before I leave, but regardless of what happens, I will give my all to the club for the remainder of the season."Dragons are languishing at the foot of the United Rugby Championship table, 17 points adrift of Italian side Zebre, having regularly been the worst-performing Welsh region.But Lewis backed Tiatia's plans for the Newport-based side."We all understand the challenges ahead, but the plans that Filo is putting in place look very promising," said Lewis.Lewis is also looking forward to working with former Cardiff front-row colleague Sam Hobbs, who is Dragons forwards coach, while acknowledging his chance at the region has come about after fellow Wales prop Leon Brown was forced to retire because of a neck injury."He [Hobbs] played a big role in my development, guiding me from the academy into senior rugby, and was a great mentor to me," Lewis said. "I also want to acknowledge that this opportunity probably wouldn't have been possible if it wasn't for Leon retiring. He's a good friend of mine, and it's unfortunate that his career was cut short due to injury."Related topicsDragonsWelsh RugbyRugby UnionHarlequinsComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 17Top storiesLive. Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win - latest & reaction10402 viewing10k viewingLive. World Snooker Championship - live text12943 viewing13k viewingNational power outage stops play at Madrid OpenPublished10 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
