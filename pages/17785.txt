She featured for the Red Roses at the 2017 World Cup, won multiple Six Nations titles, most recently in 2021, and has played for England 7s. Millar-Mills also made headlines during the 2013 Six Nations tournament when she lined up against her sister Bridget, who had opted to instead represent Scotland.Millar-Mills said: "If I was told at eight years old when I first picked up a rugby ball that I would one day play for England and be a professional rugby player, I would never have believed it."I love that I have been able to play through the transition from non-professional to professional, and I am excited to watch women's rugby grow even more."At the highest level during her club career, Millar-Mills represented Firwood Waterloo, Lichfield, Wasps, Exeter Chiefs and Harlequins, where she spent the 2024/25 season. She was twice named Premiership Players' Player of the Year, in 2015/16 and 2016/17.Millar-Mills added: "I want to say thank you to everyone, throughout my career, who has supported me, especially all my team-mates, friends, family, coaches, physios, analysts, S&C (strength and conditioning) coaches and support staff who have pushed me to be better throughout the years. "I am very proud of everything I have been able to achieve and experience through rugby because of this support."A final thank you to Quins as well. I have loved my final season of rugby and this is what makes it so bittersweet to walk away from the game."Related topicsRugby UnionEnglish RugbyHarlequinsTop storiesLive. Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win - latest & reaction10402 viewing10k viewingLive. World Snooker Championship - live text12943 viewing13k viewingNational power outage stops play at Madrid OpenPublished10 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
