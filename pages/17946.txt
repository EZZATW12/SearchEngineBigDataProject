The fans were so supportive before and during the game. Even at 1-0 down you felt this team and the fans could get it over the line."Conceding from a set piece is always difficult but from that moment we were outstanding. We could have scored a few more. Tottenham's focus was probably more on Thursday but you still have to win it and we did."On whether Jurgen Klopp has been in touch: "I am 99.9% sure that if I pick up my phone there will be a message from Jurgen. So many moments in the season the two of us have had contact. I think he showed last season what a wonderful human being he is by introducing me. But what mattered most is the team he left behind that was able to win the trophy".On becoming the first Dutch manager to win the Premier League: "It is very special because we have had some great managers, especially at a club like this."On trying to win it again next season: "That is something we are definitely going to try.

It’s special to win it at Anfield – it’s very difficult to describe. Everyone
wanted Palace to finish it [at Arsenal], but I know what Anfield is like, so
I’m glad we did it here.“It’s
completely different [to the title in 2020]. The feeling is unbelievable. The first time was lockdown
and the pandemic, but to be here five years later is incredible.“It doesn’t
matter [that I scored]. To win it at Anfield is incredible.”On his celebration: “At the
beginning of the season I always took selfies with the players. I had to think
of something special. I thought a bit about the idea and it was fine.On his own impressive campaign: “It’s incredible.
Winning the Premier League and having the impact I’ve had is incredible. For
me, this [title] feels more special. Jurgen [Klopp] is not here and other players I respect a
lot are not here, but to do it with a new manager and a new team shows what I’m
capable of.”On Arne Slot: “People
think it’s going to get easier, but now it’s going to be difficult because other
teams will catch us and it’s going to be harder for him. Even in my time here,
the second season was way harder.”On his new contract: “I’m really pleased. I believe next season and the year after
will be great, for sure.”54232Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingPostpublished at 19:47 British Summer Time 27 April19:47 BST 27 AprilOnly Harry Kane (213 for Spurs) and Sergio Aguero (184

easier ride than he ever anticipated because he would have envisaged some
hiccups, and there haven’t really been many – OK the PSG game was a
disappointment and the final against Newcastle all in one week – but even that
he dealt with really well. Other than that everything has gone really quite
well. So far so good. Overall I think he has given himself a wonderful
platform where the fans are on board, they’d loved what they’ve seen, they like
him, they’re singing his name, they’re eulogising about him. Now the
recruitment, get that right, add to the squad.They’ve kept Virg, they’ve kept
Salah. I mean, it’s all positive. He must be in dreamland, honestly. He
must be skipping through the meadows. It’s just an unbelievable start for him
and actually, let’s be perfectly honest about this, the most ardent
Liverpool fans and pundits – and I’m one of them – never envisaged a league
title this year after Klopp leaving, and making one signing, It’s just
incredible.59236Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingget involvedGet Involvedpublished at 19:40 British Summer Time 27 April19:40 BST 27 April#bbcfootball, via WhatsApp on 03301231826 or text 81111 (UK only, standard message rates apply)Without doubt the owners of LFC need to back Slot in the transfer market this summer.

For Liverpool, it doesn't matter whether people say that other teams weren't 'at it' this season. That is NOT Liverpool's fault and, to be fair to them, they WERE 'at it' so they are deserved Champions!

and drew level with Manchester United on 20 titles - as Tottenham Hotspur were demolished on a day of wild celebrations and emotion at Anfield.Arne Slot's side needed only a point to complete the formalities of their coronation, although Spurs briefly threatened a plot twist when former Liverpool striker Dominic Solanke headed them into an early lead.The shock jolted Liverpool into action, the title was signed and sealed with three goals before the break that sent their expectant fans into ecstasy at the high point of Slot's spectacular first season in succession to Jurgen Klopp.Luis Diaz turned in Dominik Szoboszlai's pass from close range to put Liverpool level after 16 minutes, the goal given after the Hungarian was initially adjudged to be offside.Any lingering doubts and anxiety were banished eight minutes later when Alexis Mac Allister fired spectacularly past Spurs keeper Guglielmo Vicario from the edge of the area.And Anfield's title party really started when Cody Gakpo was allowed time and space inside the area to turn and score Liverpool's third after 34 minutes.Liverpool laid siege to the Spurs goal in front of the Kop in the second half, Mohamed Salah cutting inside to get on the scoresheet, before accepting a phone to take a memorable selfie after 63 minutes.As Spurs collapsed, Destiny Udogie turned into his own net under pressure from Salah six minutes later.The win allowed triumphant Liverpool to celebrate a title win in front of their own fans for the first time since 1990, as they last lifted the trophy behind closed doors at Anfield in 2020 during the Covid pandemic.Liverpool fans, what did you make of the performance?How did you rate Tottenham's display?'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published15 hours agoSlot thanks Klopp moments after Liverpool win titlePublished17 hours ago20 of the best photos from Liverpool's momentous dayPublished14 hours ago'No-one expected this' -

and they celebrated in a style befitting the long wait.Anfield was surrounded by fans hours before kick-off, the team coach emerging from plumes of red smoke on this landmark day,And Liverpool delivered brilliantly, never settling for the one point they required, sweeping Spurs away in a manner that illustrated the remarkable work done by head coach Arne Slot in his first season.In what many regarded as the impossible job, the calm and measured Slot has overseen the smoothest of transitions as Liverpool have claimed the title at a canter.And the joy of the day was encapsulated by Salah's response to scoring Liverpool's fourth goal, dropping to his knees in front of the Kop before taking a selfie that will become a prized possession.The second half was simply the build-up to the release of emotion and celebration at the final whistle following a victory that was every bit as convincing as the campaign that has led Liverpool to the Premier League title.At the final whistle, red smoke came from all sides of Anfield as Liverpool as Slot and his staff congregated in the centre circle and the entire squad raced to the Kop.Spurs, like Liverpool's rivals this season, could not get near them.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Murphy on phenomenal first season for SlotSpurs the perfect party guestsTottenham threatened to disrupt Liverpool's planned title celebrations for a grand total of four minutes before reverting to this season's type to play the role of invited party guests to perfection.Once Diaz had restored parity after Solanke opened the scoring, Spurs gave Liverpool the run of Anfield in the manner they have during so many of their 19 Premier League defeats in this dismal season.Manager Ange Postecoglou was without injured captain Son Heung-min, while he kept defensive pair Cristian Romero and Micky van de Ven on the bench, along with Dejan Kulusevski, before Thursday's Europa League semi-final first leg at home to Bodo/Glimt.Liverpool simply carried too much power, intensity and desire for Spurs, perhaps understandable given the prize within their opponents grasp.The visitors simply subsided in the face of Liverpool's assault - even their attempts at any sort of damage limitation falling woefully short.Postecoglou, whose future is in serious doubt, must now try to lift his players as they try to salvage this desperate season with a European trophy.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Salah on securing Premier League title by beating TottenhamThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, We found it hard to get a grip on Liverpool  -

They’ve also failed to keep a clean sheet in any of their last 18 against the Reds in the competition.Tottenham have conceded 10 goals against Liverpool this season, losing 6-3 in the Premier League and 4-0 in the League Cup semi-final second leg. They last conceded more against an opponent in 2013-14 (11 vs Man City), while the most they’ve conceded is 14 (vs Chelsea in 2001-02).Tottenham (37) are 42 points behind Liverpool (79) coming into this match. It’s the second highest number of points Spurs have been behind a side they’re facing – they were 43 behind Arsenal when they met at White Hart Lane in April 2004, with the Gunners securing the title against them that day.With five games remaining, Liverpool have already won as many Premier League games this season as they did last term (24), while victory in this game would also see them equal their points tally from last season (82) with four games to go.Tottenham have lost 18 Premier League games this season, only losing more in 1993-94 and 2003-04 (19 both times).Liverpool have scored at least once in each of their last 29 Premier League games, since a 1-0 loss to Nottingham Forest in September. It’s the second longest scoring streak in a single campaign, after Arsenal who scored in all 38 games in 2001-02.Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah has scored 15 goals against Tottenham Hotspur in all competitions, only netting more against Manchester United (16) in his European club career. 11 of those 15 goals have come in the Premier League, with only Alan Shearer (14) netting more against Spurs in the competition.If he plays it will be Luis Díaz’s 100th Premier League appearance. He would be the 60th player to reach this milestone for Liverpool, the third most of any club after Arsenal (70) and Chelsea (63).Richarlison has scored in four of his last five Premier League appearances (4 goals), though Tottenham have lost all four of these games. Indeed, only Matheus Cunha (5) has scored in more defeats than Richarlison this term.HomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright © 2025 BBC.
