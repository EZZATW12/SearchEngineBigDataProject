Existing season ticket holders who become eligible for a discounted season ticket from 2025-26 will begin to see their concessions reduced, with a 5% reduction each season for the following five years.That means from 2029-30, senior season tickets will cost 25% more than they do today.THST board members met with the club on 21 February to discuss ticketing and the trust directors said "we disagreed on several areas and as a result of our input, changes were made"."THST believes a fuller discussion at the beginning of this process with the club would have led to more effective input and increased the prospect of an outcome with wider support," they added.When approached by BBC Sport, Spurs said they had no further comment to make.Latest Tottenham news, analysis and fan viewsGet Spurs news notifications'Disappointing'  but 'not unreasonable' - what you saidErnie: Having been a season ticket holder for 41 years & now just about to benefit from a senior citizen discount as I turn 65 in June, part of the announcement covers the fact that the price discount is going to be reduced over the next five years from 50% to 25%. The club says it's due to more older people but they only apply it certain areas. Unhappy!Andrew: We had no price increase for season ticket holders last year, so I guess we knew one was coming. Personally it's the continuing reduction in senior concessions that worries me the most. Having retired in 2022, I want to continue supporting my club but admit without the concession price, I couldn't afford to renew.David: As a 71-year-old life-long Tottenham supporter and season ticket holder affordability as a pensioner to purchase a season ticket has only been feasible with this discount. My Club's attitude to pensioners is very disappointing. We have supported you all our lives and recognition with this discount was fair and needed. A big OG Spurs please re-think.Robin: Bearing in mind the explosion of cost of living and general costs like business rates etc, it is not unreasonable, though the concessions for over 65 should continue.Neil: 6% price increase is not unreasonable given the current inflation rate AND the fact that prices have hardly increased since we moved into the new stadium. The average increase in the cost of a season ticket is much less than the cost of a Spurs shirt. The club has to make money in order to buy players and coaching staff in a very competitive world.Image source, BBC SportOur coverage of Tottenham Hotspur is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a momentEverything Spurs - go straight to all the best contentImage source, BBC SportRelated topicsPremier LeagueTottenham HotspurFootballAround the BBCBBC Sport Premier LeagueRelated internet linksTottenham Hotspur official siteThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Top storiesLive. Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win - latest & reaction10366 viewing10k viewingLive. World Snooker Championship - live text13486 viewing13k viewingNational power outage stops play at Madrid OpenPublished11 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
