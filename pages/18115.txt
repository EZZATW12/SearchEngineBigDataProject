The ICC will support the Afghan women through a separate funding mechanism, while the ACB will continue to receive a payment believed to be in the region of £13m per year.All of that funding will go towards men's cricket in Afghanistan, with women's sport outlawed in the country since the Taliban returned to power in 2021.The ACB is the only full ICC member not to field a women's team.Instead, Afghanistan's women's cricketers will be funded by the ICC in conjunction with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), Cricket Australia and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).An Afghanistan Women's XI played an exhibition match in Melbourne in January and want to be recognised as a refugee team.But the ICC is understood to have acknowledged that the prospect of Afghanistan's women playing official international matches in the near future is a distant one as it would need to be sanctioned by the ACB.Afghanistan's women have been promised a robust high-performance programme offering "advanced coaching, world-class facilities and tailored mentorship" which the ICC hopes will "help them reach their full potential".Afghanistan's men's team have retained their Test status, reached the semi-finals of last year's T20 World Cup and participated in the Champions Trophy earlier this year.BBC Sport has approached the ACB for comment.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: Cricket's Forgotten TeamRelated topicsAfghanistanCricketMore on this storyGet cricket news sent straight to your phonePublished31 JanuaryTop storiesLive. Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win - latest & reaction9338 viewing9.3k viewingLive. World Snooker Championship - live text13189 viewing13k viewingNational power outage stops play at Madrid OpenPublished14 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
