"This decision is part of our management of short-term budgetary constraints, as well as our requirement to comply with the Board's mandate to deliver balanced investment across the organisation's strategic objectives."He added that Ireland fans would however "be able to enjoy some of the world's best cricketers playing on these shores".Ireland's women will welcome Zimbabwe for three T20Is and two ODIs in July and the following month will host Pakistan for three ODIs.Their schedule will also include competing in two ICC World Cup qualifier tournaments.The women's team will play Pakistan, West Indies, Bangladesh, Thailand and Scotland in 50-over World Cup qualifying matches between 9 and 18 April.Related topicsIrelandNorthern Ireland SportAfghanistanCricketMore on this storyGet cricket news sent straight to your phonePublished31 JanuaryTop storiesLive. Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win - latest & reaction9338 viewing9.3k viewingLive. World Snooker Championship - live text13189 viewing13k viewingNational power outage stops play at Madrid OpenPublished14 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Northern Ireland sportThe 'rugby student' stepping up to lead IrelandPre-contract agreements - why are they different in NI?Record-breaker Dunlop 'breaks mould' of modern sporting heroesMeet Jude McAtamney - the New York Giants kicker from Derry Elsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
