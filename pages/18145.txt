That they got so close will only add to the pain.With help from the rest of the top order scarce, Root took the match onto his shoulders and had swung it back in his team's favour until he gloved an upper cut off seamer Azmatullah Omarzai.England used to be the standard of the white-ball world and would have still closed out the match in recent times. Any aura built under Eoin Morgan has drained away over a miserable 18-month period, however.Captain Jos Buttler admitted on Tuesday his future as captain could be decided by the result and defeat leaves him under immense pressure – this his third poor white-ball tournament in a row after failed defences of the 2023 50-over World Cup and the T20 version in 2024.Brendon McCullum has been unable to change England's fortunes since taking over as coach in January but will be given time to attempt to turn the ship around.Buttler's future is far less certain.Replacing Buttler the sensible thing to do – AgnewPublished26 FebruaryButtler to decide on captaincy future in coming weeksPublished26 FebruaryAfghanistan dump England out of Champions Trophy - as it happenedChampions Trophy tables, top run-scorers and wicket-takersPublished10 MarchRoot heroics in vainThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch the best shots from Joe Root's centuryThe threat was supposed to come from Afghanistan's spinners – as it did when they spun their side to victory over England in Delhi at the World Cup 16 months ago.Instead, it was seamer Azmatullah who finished with figures of 5-58.He started England's disappointing slide by bowling Phil Salt with a bail-trimmer for 12 before Jamie Smith tried to slog the first ball of spin in the innings, bowled by Mohammad Nabi, and was caught for nine.That brought in Root, who was superb. He limited risks and repeatedly knocked the ball into the leg side to counter spin as Harry Brook was caught and bowled by Nabi for 25, Buttler top-edged to deep square leg and Liam Livingstone sliced a cut on 10.A further 93 runs were needed from 68 balls when Overton arrived and he proved a useful companion to Root.Root showed little emotion when reaching his century in 98 deliveries but was visibly frustrated when he was caught.Calmer heads could have seen England home but that is not England's way. Both Overton and Archer were caught attempting to clear the ropes to seal England's defeat.England fail to capitaliseThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, 'That's a big one' - Archer takes two wickets in an overThe result was made more remarkable given the start England made.Only 11 runs came in the opening four overs bowled by Wood and Archer, before the latter bowled Rahmanullah Gurbaz and had Sediqullah Atal lbw in the fifth over. Archer soon bounced out Rahmat Shah for four and England had taken three powerplay wickets for the first time in 14 ODIs.But, with Wood having limped off with a knee issue after tumbling in his fourth over, Ibrahim led an initially patient rebuild. He and skipper Hashmatullah Shahidi milked England's change bowlers in a partnership of 103 from 124 balls until Rashid bowled the sweeping Shahidi.At 140-4 in the 30th over, England still had control but they lost all semblance of it late on.Ibrahim cut loose in a partnership of 111 in 9.1 overs with veteran Mohammad Nabi, who made 40 from 24, as Wood returned to hobble through 4.2 further overs which cost 37 and Archer was hit for 20 – the most expensive over of his ODI career.When Livingstone pulled up in the field, Root was left to bowl the 47th over and his first delivery was flogged over mid-wicket for six by Nabi, the next parried over the rope by Salt for another before a shoddy misfield from Duckett let through four more as England wilted.Ibrahim targeted the straight boundaries and a six off Archer took him beyond Duckett's 165 from four nights earlier – previously the highest Champions Trophy score.Having batted from the first over to the last, he was finally out caught at deep square leg to the first ball of the 50th over off Livingstone but the damage had been done.Unlike England, Afghanistan's tournament is still alive. They play Australia on Friday.'England need to realise it's not T20 cricket'Ex-England spinner Vic Marks: "This is probably an unpopular opinion but if you do not play any 50-over cricket other than internationally, you probably won't be very good at it."Look at Joe Root, who played the perfect 50-over innings. But the bowlers, they are not used to bowling 10 overs if you are basing your team on T20 form and experience."It comes down to concentration, too. Someone like Phil Salt has got some good starts this winter and if you do that in T20, you have done your job. But if that keeps happening in ODIs, losing early wickets puts the rest of the batting order under so much pressure."It is a very, very different game to T20 cricket and you have to go about it differently - I don't think many of England's players recognise that."England captain Jos Buttler: "To be eliminated from the tournament, it's really disappointing. We had our chances in the game, it was another fantastic game. We're gutted to come out the other side."Afghanistan captain Hashmatullah Shahidi: "As a team we are happy. I know the whole nation will be happy. We'll look towards the the next game."First time we beat England was in the 2023 World Cup. I keep saying that we are improving day by day as a team, we've shown it. I'm happy with the result."Related topicsEngland Men's Cricket TeamAfghanistanCricketComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 2309Top storiesLive. Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win - latest & reaction10299 viewing10k viewingLive. World Snooker Championship - live text14712 viewing15k viewingNational power outage stops play at Madrid OpenPublished14 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
