Defeat by Australia in their group opener - when they scored 351-8 but lost by five wickets - was their 11th in 15 one-day internationals since the 2023 World Cup and fifth in a row.They have also lost their past four bilateral series, although Buttler was injured for two of those.Australia's washout against South Africa means England will be guaranteed to progress to the semi-finals if they beat Afghanistan and the Proteas. Barring more rain affecting results in the group, defeat in either game will eliminate them."We need to make sure we build on the things we did well the other day, try and execute a little better in certain areas as well," Buttler told BBC Sport."Scoring 350 is a great effort and we probably left a few out there, which is a nice sign for the batting unit."With the ball we did a lot of things right but we could have just been a bit more consistent to build the scoreboard pressure."The match will be played at the same ground as England's defeat by Australia, albeit on a fresh pitch.In recent days, England players have suggested the dew had a significant impact on that match, making conditions easier for batting during Australia's chase - with the advantage possibly worth as many as 60 runs.Dew usually hampers spinners, who are unable to get as much turn from the damp surface, or grip a wet ball. Afghanistan have a fearsome spin attack, including world-class leg-spinner Rashid Khan."They are a stiff challenge but we like focus on that and be really well prepared and focus on ourselves individually and collectively performing to the best of our ability to win the game," said Buttler.Related topicsEngland Men's Cricket TeamAfghanistanCricketMore on this storyAhmed replaces Carse in England's Champions Trophy squadPublished24 FebruaryLeeds-born Coventry fan Inglis gives England blues with riotous knockPublished22 FebruaryTop storiesLive. Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win - latest & reaction11250 viewing11k viewingLive. World Snooker Championship - live text16194 viewing16k viewingNational power outage stops play at Madrid OpenPublished14 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
