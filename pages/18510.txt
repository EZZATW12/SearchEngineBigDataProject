Iddenden slotted in the spot kick to halve the deficit with her 17th of the season.After the interval Iddenden had a second penalty attempt, but this time her poor effort was easily saved by Chamberlain and Lili Mai Jones saw her thunderbolt come back off the crossbar.City put the result beyond doubt when Barry slid in her team's third with 15 minutes remaining, leaving Wrexham to wait for a first Welsh Cup triumph continues.Related topicsCardiff CityWelsh FootballWrexhamFootballWomen's FootballTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8246 viewing8.2k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished6 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
