That's something none of us will ever forget," said Smith."I don't think it'll ever be done again. It's an incredible achievement and it just shows how good the football club is and everyone behind the scenes."Co-owners Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney made no secret of their desire to swiftly guide Wrexham into the Premier League after taking control of the club in February 2021.Now just one step away from English football's top flight, Smith feels "anything can happen" when it comes to the Red Dragons.When asked if the club could reach the Premier League, Smith responded: "Hopefully we can. It's a tough league. I don't think anyone expected us to get promoted out of this league [League One]."This club is like no other, anything can happen. I'd like to hope we could do it and I could be a part of it."Wrexham - aim has always been the Premier LeaguePublished1 day agoWrexham owners 'deserve' success - ParkinsonPublished1 day agoWrexham's remarkable rise - and what comes nextPublished1 day agoJust three minutes after Ollie Rathbone scored the opener against Charlton, Smith doubled Wrexham's lead with a fine volley from Matty James' floated delivery.Smith then sent in a late header to cap off a memorable day for the Welsh side as fans poured on to the pitch to celebrate after the match.And Smith revealed what Deadpool star Reynolds said about his first goal when they spoke after the match."He said I was a 'beast' and that it was a 'kung fu finish'," explained the forward."I think he asked if I'd been watching him in his films and he just said he was proud and delighted for me."My dad met him today, he watches all of his films. He was star struck and he's 67 years old, so I think he was more delighted with meeting him than watching me score."It's surreal meeting them [Reynolds and McElhenney], they're both amazing people. They're down to earth, nice guys."Smith's brace against the Addicks took his tally of goals for Wrexham since joining from Reading in January to seven.But the 27-year-old says he was "desperate" to join Parkinson's side midway through the campaign, despite carrying the pressure of being the first player signed for more than £1m by the club."There was a lot of pressure coming in and being quite a big signing," he added."It's something I enjoy, pressure is a privilege. When the opportunity came about, I was desperate to get in."I knew at this level I could help any team, I've proven that in the past. To get two goals [against Charlton] is just amazing."Related topicsWelsh FootballLeague OneWrexhamChampionshipFootballComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 48Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9100 viewing9.1k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished5 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
