"They lost on Monday against Charlton and I always feel at this stage of the season, the top teams win because that's why they're at the top."We know what we've got to do, we've got two games to do it and we'll be going all out to try and achieve that."Related topicsWelsh FootballCharlton AthleticLeague OneWrexhamFootballTop storiesLive. Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win - latest & reaction9119 viewing9.1k viewingLive. World Snooker Championship - live text15404 viewing15k viewingNational power outage stops play at Madrid OpenPublished18 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
