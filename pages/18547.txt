They have also picked up a global following via a Disney documentary series."The owners there have done a fantastic job, not only galvanising a club and taking the club forward, they've actually taken a community which needed it as well," added Jones as he clarified his earlier comments."It's a Welsh community, so one that has heart and they've done a magnificent job."What I meant was what follows Wrexham around is a lot of pomp, a lot of ceremony, a lot of cameras, a lot of coverage, a lot of scrutiny."They've handled that very well. At times that can be a distraction, and I don't want it to be for our thing, so that's what I meant - hopefully that clears that."Wrexham will clinch promotion this weekend if they beat Charlton and Wycombe fail to win at Leyton Orient.Related topicsWelsh FootballCharlton AthleticLeague OneWrexhamFootballTop storiesLive. Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win - latest & reaction9119 viewing9.1k viewingLive. World Snooker Championship - live text15404 viewing15k viewingNational power outage stops play at Madrid OpenPublished18 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
