I met a lot of special people and people who I'm still close with," said Dobson."It always seems to be that things like that happen and you end up playing against former teams when it matters the most."But I'm just really hoping we can deliver like we did on Monday and bring a special evening."Charlton remain in the hunt to finish second behind champions Birmingham City having claimed 16 points from their previous six league outings.And Wrexham manager Parkinson feels Charlton are reaping the rewards of fielding a more consistent starting 11 of late under Nathan Jones."I think Nathan has picked a more or less consistent side over the last 10 to 15 games," said Parkinson."He was searching for a balance in the team and he's clearly found it because their record is really good."22:14 25 AprilTrading places? Cardiff and Wrexham's crunch weekend, published at 22:14 25 AprilTrading places? Cardiff and Wrexham's crunch weekendAttributionFootballComments102'Inspirational' Archie gives Wrexham 'sense of perspective'published at 17:40 25 April17:40 25 AprilImage source, Sarah KyffinMidfielder George Dobson says the visit of young fan Archie White to Wrexham's training ground has given players a "sense of perspective" before their crunch League One fixture with Charlton Athletic.Phil Parkinson's side will secure a third successive promotion if they beat the Addicks at the Stok Cae Ras on Saturday (17:30 BST) and Wycombe Wanderers fail to win against Leyton Orient.Before what could be a decisive game for Wrexham, 12-year-old Archie - who was diagnosed with myeloid sarcoma, an extremely rare type of cancer, in 2024 - visited the club's training ground.A number of players, including Dobson, Paul Mullin, Ollie Rathbone and Arthur Okonkwo, posed for photographs with Wrexham supporter Archie."It's the sense of perspective. At the end of the day, we're just playing a game of football," said Dobson."It was great Archie coming in and seeing his family. He seemed like he had a great day. "That's the special thing about the club, they really do buy into all aspects of the community and the family aspect. "I think that's what's set the tone for the club in general and why they've been so successful in the last few years and hopefully we can continue that."Director Humphrey Ker has regularly spoken of the club's eagerness to showcase the wider community in addition to football matters in the 'Welcome to Wrexham' documentary.And boss Phil Parkinson hailed Archie as an "inspiration" following his visit to Colliers Park on Thursday."It was great to see young Archie at the training ground and what a great young man he is," said the Wrexham manager."It's an inspiration with how he's coping with all of his problems."That's what a football club is all about, it's about being part of the community. "Wrexham is very much at the heart of this town, and any supporter or anyone we feel can benefit from connecting with us, then obviously we try and do that."14:47 25 AprilJones' 'circus' dig 'lacked respect' - Parkinson, published at 14:47 25 AprilJones' 'circus' dig 'lacked respect' - ParkinsonAttributionFootball08:05 25 AprilEFL Preview: Points win prizes in survival scrap, published at 08:05 25 AprilEFL Preview: Points win prizes in survival scrapAttributionFootballComments9406:03 25 AprilCharlton boss Jones defuses Wrexham 'circus' row, published at 06:03 25 AprilCharlton boss Jones defuses Wrexham 'circus' rowAttributionFootball'Rollercoaster' run-in continues in Charlton testpublished at 12:40 24 April12:40 24 AprilImage source, Rex FeaturesOllie Rathbone hopes the Stok Cae Ras will play host to a blockbuster on Saturday as Wrexham and Charlton Athletic lock horns knowing both clubs remain in the race for automatic promotion from League One.Wrexham returned to second place as they beat Blackpool 2-1 on Monday while Wycombe Wanderers were beaten 4-0 by the Addicks at Adams Park.It leaves Phil Parkinson's side two points clear of the Chairboys, and four ahead of Charlton, with just two regular season matches left to play.And Rathbone believes the fact both sides still have everything to play for will ensure this weekend's meeting between Wrexham and Charlton will be a mouth-watering one."It's quite topsy turvy this whole thing, a bit of a rollercoaster," he said."We just need to stay calm, go into the game and do our best. We won't get carried away, we'll just play the game in front of us."I think some people will say, coming to the end of the season, it's easier playing teams that have less to play for. I don't find that to be the case. "When teams don't have any pressure on them, they can play more freely."I think it'll make for a much better game that Charlton are right in the mix as well."Wrexham will clinch an historic third successive promotion this weekend if they beat Charlton and Wycombe fail to win at Leyton Orient. "People forget how far the club has come in such a short space of time," added Rathbone."To be fighting at the top of the league for automatic promotion is brilliant."It would be a huge achievement for me personally, and for the club and the town."Rathbone scored his seventh league goal of the campaign last time out in Wrexham's triumph over Blackpool.It represents the 28-year-old's best goal return in a season of his career."I'm really happy with that, especially when I didn't play for the first chunk of the season, so it's a pretty good return," he added.11:31 24 AprilFormer Wales U21 goalkeeper Maxwell forced to retire, published at 11:31 24 AprilFormer Wales U21 goalkeeper Maxwell forced to retireAttributionFootball11:41 23 AprilWrexham a 'circus' says Charlton boss Jones, published at 11:41 23 AprilWrexham a 'circus' says Charlton boss JonesAttributionFootballprevious pagePage 1 of 42123456…42next pageHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright © 2025 BBC.
