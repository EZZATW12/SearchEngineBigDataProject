Their members are a fitting reflection of the integrity and spirit of the town and they will always have an important role at the club."The pair signalled the announcement in advance by adding the letter W to the start of their names on social media accounts. Reynolds, who has over 17 million followers on Twitter, and McElhenny also used the platform to add their own brand of humour to the completed takeover.This X post cannot be displayed in your browser.

"We are also committed to investing in current and identifying future members of the first-team squad as we build towards a promotion challenge."In addition, we are in the process of developing an outstanding team off the field by combining the know-how of the committed club staff and volunteers with new hires and experienced advisors. Our CEO search is progressing and we expect to have someone in place before the end of the season."All of these people will help us create the kind of commercial opportunities that the third oldest club in the world deserves, and we will reinvest that revenue back into Wrexham AFC and the community.      "2020 was a difficult year and there are likely to be further public health challenges in the months ahead, but we hope to be cheering the team on from the stands as soon as it's safe to do so in 2021."This X post cannot be displayed in your browser.

Former Liverpool chief executive Peter Moore, who has taken on an informal role advising the actors, said that they are "in it for the long term".Moore said he received assurances about the "authentic and genuine" intentions behind the deal during conversations with the screen stars.School friends 'predicted' Reynolds arrivalThe completion of the takeover has received an overwhelmingly positive reaction from supporters. One fan, based in America, told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast he believes the investment will improve the team and raise the profile of his home town.Dyfed Avalon-Thomas, originally from Wrexham but now living in Pullman, Washington State told the programme: "I think they'll attract the higher calibre of player, people who maybe wouldn't have wanted to come up to Wrexham are going to be tempted now."This is literally putting Wrexham on the map, I no longer have to say I'm from North Wales slash near Liverpool, I can just say I'm from Wrexham."A timeline of Wrexham's Hollywood takeoverEarly 2020: Wrexham director Spencer Harris is approached by an intermediary about a potential change in ownership of the club.Summer 2020: Harris and his fellow directors agree to sign a non-disclosure agreement with the interested parties, not realising the need for secrecy was due to the prospective investors being Hollywood stars.23 September 2020: Members of the Wrexham Supporters Trust (WST) vote overwhelmingly to allow talks that could lead to an entire takeover of the club to go ahead at a special general meeting.24 September 2020: Reynolds and McElhenney are announced by Wrexham as the potential investors.8 November 2020: Reynolds and McElhenney present their vision for the club to the Wrexham Supporters Trust over Zoom, saying they want to turn the club into "a global force".16 November 2020: Over 98% of supporters vote in favour of the takeover.18 November 2020: Wrexham's soon-to-be owners Reynolds and McElhenney donate £6,000 to adapt Wrexham fan Aiden Stott's home.22 November 2020: Wrexham boss Dean Keates reveals he has spoken to Reynolds and McElhenney and predicts they will "take the club to the next level".30 November 2020: Former Liverpool chief executive Peter Moore says he is to work as an adviser at Wrexham.15 December 2020: Moore tells BBC Sport Wales that Reynolds and McElhenney are "in it for the long haul".19 January 2021: Wrexham announce that the board have concluded negotiation of the Share Purchase Agreement and have exchanged contracts.27 January 2021: Reynolds and McElhenney donate money to strengthen the Wrexham squad despite the takeover not being complete.5 February 2021:The Financial Conduct Authority approves the proposed takeover of Wrexham by McElhenney and Reynolds.9 February, 2021: Wrexham's Hollywood takeover is completed.Related topicsWelsh FootballWrexhamFootballNational LeagueAround the BBCBBC Sport National LeagueRelated internet linksWrexham official siteThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Top storiesLive. Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win - latest & reaction9296 viewing9.3k viewingLive. World Snooker Championship - live text14667 viewing15k viewingNational power outage stops play at Madrid OpenPublished17 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
