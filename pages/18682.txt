I've already been relegated twice before. I didn't expect this result at all and it came so fast."Lei is already targeting more titles but a major pay day could come if he finishes top of this season's Home Nations Series money list, and that is not out of the question.With just the Welsh Open to come, in February, Lei has £110,000 to his name, putting him just £8,600 behind leader Neil Robertson.Lei will need to win a qualifying match to secure his place in the draw in Llandudno, with the player who finishes top of the money list set to collect a £150,000 bonus.Related topicsSnookerMore on this storyTearful Ford wins Shoot Out for first ranking titlePublished7 December 2024O'Sullivan to face Higgins at MastersPublished1 December 2024Trump beats Hawkins to win second UK Championship crownPublished2 December 2024Top storiesLive. Liverpool announce parade date after Premier League title win - latest & reaction10117 viewing10k viewingLive. World Snooker Championship - live text17541 viewing18k viewingNational power outage stops play at Madrid OpenPublished20 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
