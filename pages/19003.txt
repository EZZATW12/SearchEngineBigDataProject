The Schoolwear Association says the plans could mean parents spend more on replacing lower-quality generic garments which might not last as long as branded items. They say branded uniforms also play a role in reducing inequality in schools and improving behaviour.Kate McGough / BBCFull school uniforms can cost parents hundreds of poundsMany parents rely on uniform exchanges to afford the full list of items required by their children's schools.At Darlington Borough Council's exchange, located on the ground floor of a multi-storey car park, all the uniforms have been donated and are free to local parents, who are able to stock up on branded items from over 25 schools in the area.The exchange has been running for five years and has given out approximately 12,000 items to 4,000 customers.Volunteer Kay says she is worried some school uniform policies will still be too strict even after the government's planned limit on logos comes into force."Some of the schools are particular about a certain skirt, a certain style from a certain supplier - so that can cause problems and be quite expensive for parents," she says.But she says it is a good thing that more parents will be able to buy more of their uniforms from other retailers, like supermarkets.Kate McGough / BBCVolunteer Kay provides free uniforms for local families from the ground floor unit of Feethams car park in DarlingtonIn Darlington town centre, one mum with two sons at primary school and a daughter in secondary said she was worried about the jump in uniform costs coming when her sons join secondary school."It's just a nightmare," she said."My daughter's school is really strict on the uniform. You can't get black trousers, it's got to be grey, or pleated skirts. For their shoes alone I'm looking at £60 a year, and there's three of them. That's not including blazers, PE kits or anything else."It's a lot of money when it all adds up."Matt Perry, head teacher at The Halifax Academy in West Yorkshire, says he makes sure pupils follow the school's rules on uniform, but also wants to ensure it is affordable for parents.The school gives its pupils ties for free, and parts of the PE kit and a school blazer are the only compulsory items with branding on.The school may cut back further if limits to branded items are brought in.Kate McGough / BBCHalifax head teacher Matt Perry says uniforms are important, but they can be flexible with the rules where necessaryThe school is in an area of Halifax with high deprivation, and has a uniform bank as well as a laundrette to wash pupils' uniforms.Mr Perry says branded school uniform can bring a sense of pride and inclusion, but that tough uniform policies can be a barrier to attendance."There are so many different factors that children have to face in order to have clean and correct uniform that is used daily," he says."As long as we see the families really trying to adhere to the uniform policy that we've got, we can be flexible with how we interpret that. So if it is in the right colours but it's not branded, that doesn't matter to us."The Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill is due to go through its second reading in the House of Lords later this week.SchoolsSchool uniformRelatedHow will new Ofsted school ratings work?1 hr agoFamily & EducationThe never-ending juggle of managing school admin5 hrs agoWalesSchool extends staff parking with demolition plan6 hrs agoWolverhamptonMore10 Apr 2025School swaps uniform for tracksuits and trainersThe headteacher does not believe "that wearing a shirt and tie means you will learn better".10 Apr 2025Shropshire1 Apr 2025Girl claims victory in trouser pockets battle"They didn't have real pockets; they just had fake ones," Georgia explains.1 Apr 2025Suffolk20 Feb 2025Families spending hundreds on school uniforms hope new law tackles costsParents tell BBC News NI that a new law needs to address the expense of kitting out children for school.20 Feb 2025Northern Ireland18 Feb 2025Schools could be forced to explain uniform price under new lawEducation Minister Paul Givan says the new bill provides "scope" for a price cap but that more work needs to be done.18 Feb 2025Northern Ireland Politics13 Dec 2024Branded uniforms are a 'financial drain' on parents About 7,500 people respond to a consultation about a new law to make all school uniforms affordable.13 Dec 2024Northern IrelandBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.
