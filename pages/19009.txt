We believe it was an isolated incident."Alison Lowe, deputy mayor of West Yorkshire for policing and crime, said the man was being held under police guard.'We're here for you'She said: "The suspect injured themselves and is now in hospital under police guard so the threat has been eliminated."Lowe reassured the public and said there would be an increased police presence across Headingley in "the coming days and weeks"."This is a very, very rare incident and the police know that the public are very frightened, so there is a much bigger police presence."I would be scared if I had witnessed or been close to an incident of that magnitude."All I can say to those women and girls is that we're here for you.

It can get busy sometimes."Headingley councillor Abdul Hannan said his thoughts were with the victims and said the council was working closely with the police and reassuring the community."It's horrific," he said."There is a lot of footfall in that area, it is a busy stretch, especially on a Saturday."It is a tragedy what has taken place."Listen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North.More on this story'Otley Run should be happy and silly but this is scary'Two women injured in attack involving crossbowRelated Internet linksWest Yorkshire PoliceHeadingleyLeedsRelated'Otley Run should be happy and silly but this is scary'17 hrs agoWest YorkshireBack-to-back life on city's streets caught on camera19 Apr 2025EnglandInquest opens after man found unresponsive at home4 Apr 2025BradfordMore4 hrs ago'I'm fleeing domestic abuse - it cost me thousands because I have a job'People are not eligible for some support when fleeing abuse if they have a job, a charity says.4 hrs agoWest Yorkshire7 hrs agoWellbeing hubs moving too far away, say usersThe centres in Leeds offer support for adults but the number of users is dwindling, council says.7 hrs agoWest Yorkshire1 day agoWoman with terminal cancer to run Everest marathonDr Shaunna Burke, a Leeds researcher in exercise and cancer, uses her knowledge to stay fit.1 day agoEngland2 days agoTwo women injured in attack involving crossbowA man, 38, who suffered a "self-inflicted injury" is arrested and a crossbow and firearm recovered.2 days agoWest Yorkshire2 days agoCut-outs of people to urge drivers to slow downCut-outs of 30 people and four dogs are being displayed along Meanwood Road in Leeds.2 days agoWest YorkshireBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.
