Fans on issues under the radarpublished at 12:3812:38Image source, Getty ImagesWe asked for you to tell us one thing that no one is talking about - but should be - at Arsenal.Here are some of your comments:Rob: Many will talk about the injuries, which played a big part. I feel like there was also a bit of a physical and mental hangover at the start of the season from last year's run which took us so close. A fresher team next year, a few recruited, and possibly the momentum of a strong Champions League campaign and they will be ready to go.Rachel: I think there is a discussion to be had around the Arsenal club captaincy. I wonder if Martin Odegaard is tough enough. He seems to have had several quiet matches where he doesn't make an impact and I'm not sure his personality is forceful enough. When I think back to Patrick Vieira, there's no contest.Ian: We are terrible at selling players for market value and have been overpaying our players for years. Fans are having to pay the price for this economic failure (again) with season ticket price rises coming once more next season at a time of financial uncertainty for most families.Robert: I'm afraid Mikel Arteta has cloned us into a Gareth Southgate team of safety-first football. There's not enough creativity in midfield and even if we had a proper centre-forward I'm not convinced we would have won the title.Guy: I think the biggest thing this summer will be Arsenal keeping hold of their best players. We have seen in the past where players leave to actually win silverware. Players like Samir Nasri, Cesc Fabregas and Robin van Persie all left because they wanted titles and trophies. Too many seasons with nothing to show will mean that players like Gabriel, William Saliba, Ben White and Declan Rice may start looking for greener pastures.Gossip: Arsenal join race for teenage Juventus strikerpublished at 07:5907:59Arsenal will compete with Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Manchester City for Turkey international forward Kenan Yildiz from Juventus.

You know your club best, tell us the one thing that no-one is talking about at Arsenal but really should be.Let us know hereGossip: Gunners at advanced stage in pursuit of Zubimendipublished at 07:50 25 April07:50 25 AprilArsenal are at an advanced stage in negotiations to sign Real Sociedad and Spain midfielder Martin Zubimendi, 26, who has a 60m euros (£51.2m) release clause in his contract.

Read Friday's full gossip column Follow the gossip column on BBC SportWhat has stopped Arsenal winning the Premier League?published at 16:23 24 April16:23 24 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesWe asked for your views on why Arsenal have not been able to get over the line and win the Premier League this season.Here are some of your comments:NM: Our transfer/loan strategy has primarily let us down. I think Edu and Arteta were the only people on the planet who didn't think our number one priority last summer should have been a striker. We should have held on to Smith-Rowe or Nketiah, offloaded Jesus and gone hard for a proper striker to work with Havertz. And don't get me started on Sterling - dead weight.Raymond: Arsenal squad not big enough and prone to injuries. Once results became inconsistent so did the players' attitudes. They raise their game for Champions League but not anymore for Premier League. Need to start again next season with better players.Nigel: Some of the players have a lack of concentration at key moments. A lack of a quality striker and unfit lesser strikers have also not helped. Mentality is weak and needs to improve in some of the players. On the plus side we have a good crop of youngsters coming through and Arteta needs to utilise them more next season.Andy: Never had the self-belief to win games in open-play. Too many times this season, Arsenal faked injuries and wasted time when 1-0 up, rather than pushing for another goal. Too reliant and focused on winning free kicks and corners. They didn't believe they were good enough, and it turns out they weren't.Not an Arsenal fan? Find and follow your club hereWilliam: Arteta, Arteta, Arteta, Arteta, Arteta. Enough said.Jim: Too many injuries throughout the season. First Odegaard, then Saka, then Havertz out for so long. Clearly a striker is needed but they must fit into the way Arsenal play. Havertz is not a centre forward and plays as an attacking forward. Arsenal need just one or two players to win the league. Lastly, too much reliance on Saka both this season and last. He plays too much and tires towards the end of the season. Trossard continues to be a great buy.Paulo: We haven't been helped by a number of controversial decisions but ultimately squad depth, particularly in the forward line, has meant we had few options when the injuries came.  Poor planning on Arsenal's part but I also wonder how much financial fair play rules restricted what we could do when we needed. If you look at Arteta though, he's not used any of that as an excuse and is all for him and the players available taking accountability.Jim: It looks like we have gone backwards this season, but we've lost the same amount of games as Liverpool over all competitions. The loss of our entire front-line for a fair part of the season hasn't helped, but the striker issue has been the most pivotal in my opinion. We should have bought a striker last season, let alone in this season's January window, and it might have been the difference between the draws and a win. Champions League still a possibility though so it could be worse.What is the best way to miss out on a title?published at 14:28 24 April14:28 24 AprilLaura Kirk-FrancisFan writerImage source, Getty ImagesWhat is the best way to miss out on a title?This is a question I've been asking myself this morning after last night's 2-2 home draw to Crystal Palace, in which Arsenal twice surrendered the lead. A point on Sunday will see Liverpool win the Premier League at Anfield.In the cold light of day, this has been an unconvincing title challenge from Arsenal. Last night's draw was the ninth time Arsenal have drawn a match from a winning position. Injuries to key players have been brutal, but 13 draws is well below what I expected from Mikel Arteta's side this season.But this is also a campaign that has had some incredible highs. A 5-1 thrashing of Manchester City and another double over North London rivals Tottenham to name just a couple. It is therefore even more frustrating that these big moments have failed to translate into any consistency or momentum. This has been a season of very high highs barely masking disappointing but not necessarily dramatic failures.Back to the original question then. As a fan, there is something more satisfying about bowing out of a title race in a blaze of glory. Perhaps conceding a last minute goal that finally hands the league to a rival. This time around, Liverpool will be worthy title winners, but Arsenal have played their part. There has been no blaze of glory or spectacular failure, just a slow and inevitable slip into second.The saving grace is that Arsenal still have a semi-final against Paris St. Germain in the Champions League to prepare for. But in the Premier League, the remaining silver lining is that it will likely be Tottenham who get the front row seat to Liverpool's celebrations. Slim pickings to cap-off an underwhelming season.Find more from Laura Kirk-Francis at the Latte Firm podcast, externalWhy have Arsenal not won the Premier League this season?published at 10:43 24 April10:43 24 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesSo, after Arsenal's draw against Crystal Palace, Liverpool need just a point from their final five fixtures to confirm their Premier League title win.In truth, it has been a matter of time until the Gunners were mathematically out of the title race, but a run of just four wins from nine games has accelerated the process as Mikel Arteta's side focus their attentions on the Champions League.You have been watching the team closer than anyone this season.So tell us simply, why have they not been able to get it done in the Premier League?Let us know hereAnd if you want to make it easier, choose from our suggestions over hereFive games that cost Arsenal the Premier League titlepublished at 10:41 24 April10:41 24 AprilNat HaywardBBC Sport journalistWith Liverpool on the brink of winning the Premier League before the end of April, BBC Sport has looked back at five pivotal games that cost Arsenal the title.Image source, Getty ImagesArsenal 1-1 Brighton (31 August 2024)This was the match that foreshadowed much of what would hinder Arsenal for the rest of the season. The Gunners took the lead through Kai Havertz and looked on course to continue their perfect start to the season before Declan Rice picked up a needless second yellow card for kicking the ball away - see Leandro Trossard two games later at Manchester City - before Joao Pedro levelled in the second half. Arsenal have gone on to top the league in red cards (five) and have drawn nine games from winning positions - the most of any team since 2008.Image source, Getty ImagesBournemouth 2-0 Arsenal (19 October 2024)Another red card cost Arsenal as their October trip to the south coast ended in their first defeat of the season. William Saliba was dismissed in the first half before  two late goals gave impressive Bournemouth victory. Mikel Arteta was without the injured Bukayo Saka, whose longer absence later in the campaign would cost the Gunners further.Image source, Getty ImagesNewcastle 1-0 Arsenal (2 November 2024)Newcastle came into this game in 10th and without a win in five Premier League games but dominated Arsenal in the early kick-off at St James' Park. The result allowed Liverpool to open up an eight-point gap at the top after the Reds had rescued a point at Emirates Stadium the previous weekend.Image source, Getty ImagesArsenal 2-2 Aston Villa (18 January 2025)After defeat to Newcastle in November, Arsenal would not lose again until late February. In this time, however, they drew five times, the last of which against Aston Villa feeling the most damaging. The Gunners led 2-0 at the hour mark but conceded twice in eight minutes, before seeing a late Kai Havertz strike ruled out for handball, missing the chance to move within four points of the top.Image source, Getty ImagesArsenal 0-1 West Ham (22 February 2025)Arsenal's most recent defeat felt terminal. Arteta's team could have closed the gap to Liverpool to five points with 12 games to go and put pressure on the Reds' visit to Manchester City. Instead, they struggled at home against lowly West Ham and had their misery compounded by Myles Lewis-Skelly's second-half red card. In the league, the Gunners have not fully recovered, drawing five of their eight league matches since.10:41 24 AprilSelect the main two reasons why Arsenal have not won the league, published at 10:41 24 AprilSelect the main two reasons why Arsenal have not won the leagueAttributionArsenalSnatching stalemates from the jaws of victorypublished at 10:41 24 April10:41 24 AprilWednesday's 2-2 draw against Crystal Palace was the ninth game this season in which Arsenal have led but gone on to draw.The Gunners took the lead twice in the first-half but were pegged back by the Eagles who claimed a point through Jean-Phillipe Mateta's fine late equaliser.The nine occasions Arsenal have drawn matches in which they have led is the most by a team in a single campaign since north London rivals Tottenham in 2007-08 (also nine).Interestingly, despite Liverpool's huge lead at the top of the table, Mikel Arteta's side have only lost three games this season - two fewer than last season - but have drawn 13 times, which is eight more than last year.'Half-cooked' performance 'forgivable' ahead of PSG tiepublished at 08:07 24 April08:07 24 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesWe asked for your thoughts after Arsenal drew with Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Wednesday night.Here are some of your comments:Alan: We might have had 11 bodies on the pitch, but their minds were elsewhere. It was sloppy at the back and blunt up front. There was a little too much champagne football in our defensive third against a spirited Palace forward line.Kevin: We were lazy, sloppy and got what we deserved. Playing negatively and having a negative mindset causes severe problems.Ian: Absolute garbage. It was boring football, with too much sideways passing in defence, which ultimately led to a gift of a goal for Palace. They need to move the ball from back to front much quicker if they want to get to the Champions League final. A very disappointing performance.Not an Arsenal fan? Find and follow your club hereRachel: Exactly the kind of half-cooked performance that has got us where we are this season. Boring, boring Arsenal. Too many players are off their game and looking like they have already started their summer holidays. This type of match has become so typical at this time of the season, sadly. Hugely disappointing.Roy: Forgivable as Paris St-Germain is around the corner, but it wasn't to our usual standard. Martin Odegaard didn't play as well as he usually does, and one can only hope that William Saliba will not make such an error against PSG!Mike: I cannot believe that was Arsenal trying to win a game. There was constant side and back passing plus little attempt to push to score. PSG and Liverpool must have been laughing all evening.Analysis: Arsenal 2-2 Crystal Palacepublished at 07:51 24 April07:51 24 AprilAlex HowellBBC Sport football news reporterImage source, PA MediaThis match was always going to be tricky for Arsenal manager Arteta to navigate with Tuesday's Champions League semi-final first leg against Paris St-Germain looming.And this draw, Arsenal's 13th in the Premier League, is one of the big reasons why the Gunners have fallen away in their title challenge.Arteta picked a strong side six days before Luis Enrique's team come to north London, with Bukayo Saka on the bench as a precaution.Saka was named as a substitute after he took a kick to his ankle in the win over Ipswich at the weekend, and Arteta played Trossard as a striker as he looked to try options before their season-defining game in Europe.Trossard, who is likely to start in the central striking role next week as Merino - who missed this match through injury - will be needed in midfield because of Thomas Partey's suspension.The Belgian produced an excellent touch for the second Arsenal goal - his fourth in his past four Premier League appearances, matching the amount he registered in his previous 31.'Have to do much better' - what Arteta saidpublished at 07:47 24 April07:47 24 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesArsenal manager Mikel Arteta spoke to BBC Sport after Wednesday's draw against Crystal Palace: "We dropped our standards and credit to Crystal Palace. We struggled to find consistency in the game. We gave the ball away in simply ways and we were late in everything we did. I am disappointed."On whether the schedule plays a factor: "Yes, it does. And we have so many players out and not available and therefore you drop certain standards. But we have to do much better than we did."On whether players' mind were on the Champions League semi-finals with Paris St-Germain that begin next Wednesday: "We have spoken about avoiding our focus being elsewhere. We have enough time to prepare for PSG but here we didn't deliver enough rights to win the game."It is nice to have a long gap. We need it and we need players back to full strength."Did you know?This was only the third time under Mikel Arteta that Arsenal failed to win a Premier League game in which they twice took the lead - the others were 2-2 draws against Tottenham (September 2023) and Liverpool (October 2024).Since the start of last season, Arsenal have scored 38 set-piece goals (excluding penalties) in the Premier League - six more than any other side.Gossip: Arsenal retain Zubimendi hopepublished at 07:11 24 April07:11 24 AprilArsenal remain hopeful of signing 26-year-old Spain international Martin Zubimendi, despite the Real Sociedad midfielder being linked with a move to Real Madrid.

'Why do we need another defender?' Fans on Huijsen linkspublished at 19:29 23 April19:29 23 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesWe asked for your thoughts on a potential Arsenal move for defender Dean Huijsen this summer.Here are some of your comments:Tharun: It seems like a bad idea to mess with Saliba and Gabriel, but I thought Calafiori was a silly signing and that Merino was pointless. I guess I was proven wrong. Moral is don't doubt Arteta.Martin: I thought Huijsen would be a target for Liverpool or Real Madrid, but Liverpool just renewed Van Dijk and Real Madrid became less attractive recently. Huijsen would be great long-term cover for Gabriel and Saliba, eventually replacing one of them. Maybe we'll cash in on Saliba in a few years...Kalii: It's good that Arsenal are being linked with players who are linked to other top clubs, but I don't think they need Huijsen. Saliba and Gabriel are the established first two and I believe Kiwior has put in a good showing. Arsenal should save their money for a centre-forward who I believe they will definitely get this summer.Alec: Why do we need another defender? The whole season we've said, 'please a striker and we'll win' - and now Arteta's hunting for more defenders? Are we trying to go from Left-back FC to Centre-back FC?18:55 23 AprilBerta may hold key to Partey's Arsenal future, published at 18:55 23 AprilBerta may hold key to Partey's Arsenal futureAttributionArsenalArsenal's Huijsen interest - what do you make of potential defensive target?published at 17:58 23 April17:58 23 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesBournemouth defender Dean Huijsen is attracting genuine interest from Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Newcastle heading into the summer transfer window, according to BBC Sport senior football correspondent Sami Mokbel.Initial reports have indicated Huijsen has a £50m release clause - information that has been confirmed by multiple BBC Sport sources.It is understood that while regular playing time to ensure his continued development will be a key consideration for Huijsen when he comes to settle on his future, the prospect of Champions League participation will also be a factor.Arsenal central defensive duo William Saliba and Gabriel have been mainstays of Mikel Arteta's team and while the Gunners have an interest in Huijsen, breaking up that formidable partnership could prove a tall order.So, what do you think about a potential move for Huijsen? Is the 20-year-old an exciting target? How do you feel about the £50m release clause? Would he be the right fit for Arsenal or should they be looking elsewhere?Let us know here17:14 23 AprilFour Premier League clubs eyeing Huijsen, published at 17:14 23 AprilFour Premier League clubs eyeing HuijsenAttributionPremier LeagueComments375Sutton's predictions: Arsenal v Crystal Palacepublished at 09:17 23 April09:17 23 AprilA lot depends on Mikel Arteta's team selection here and how he manages the minutes for Arsenal's players, but he went strong against Ipswich at the weekend and, even when it was 11 versus 11, that wasn't a contest.The Gunners have got the weekend off before they face Paris St-Germain in the first leg of their Champions League semi-final on Tuesday, so I think Arteta will go pretty strong again here.Crystal Palace had to play the second half with 10 men against Bournemouth on Saturday but still held on for a point, which was important after they had taken a couple of wallopings from Manchester City and Newcastle.The Eagles conceded five goals last time they faced Arsenal, at Selhurst Park before Christmas, and it is tough to see them getting anything out of this game.I don't see Arsenal doing as much damage this time, but it should still be a comfortable win for them.Sutton's prediction: 2-0Make your own prediction here, externalGossip: Arsenal register Cunha interestpublished at 07:25 23 April07:25 23 AprilArsenal, Newcastle and Nottingham Forest have all registered an interest in Matheus Cunha.
