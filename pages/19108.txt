Both Fulham and Brighton are one point ahead of Bournemouth with four Premier League games remaining. Scott told BBC Radio Solent after their 1-1 draw with Manchester United: "Just like that it changes. Brighton and Fulham both score in the 90th minute and that fuelled us [on Sunday] I think. We had to come here and we knew we had to get three points. Obviously we didn't manage to do that so it's gutting but we've got enough in us."We know we can compete with the top teams in this league. We've got Aston Villa, Man City and Arsenal coming up. We've beat Man City and Arsenal already this season so we know we can do it. Obviously they are tough, hard fixtures, but it's on us. "We've got to give everything, try and dig away and get those last results to really push us over the edge and get the European spot."Listen to the full clip over here'Ironically the ref got this right'published at 10:4310:43This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Match of the Day 2 pundit Danny Murphy says the challenge which Evanilson was sent off for in Bournemouth's 1-1 draw with Manchester United was "completely accidental" and a yellow card was "perfect".The referee gave a yellow card but it was upgraded to a red following a video assistant referee review.Murphy said: "That left foot goes from under him on the slip and catches him. The right foot he was going to tackle with doesn't catch him. It's completely accidental so a yellow was perfect."Former Newcastle goalkeeper Shay Given added: "Andoni Iraola was going mental after the game because everyone can see he slips into the tackle - he wasn't trying to endanger anyone. He slipped over and a yellow card would be the right decision. I think they should appeal it and I think they'll get let off."Bournemouth 1-1 Man Utd - the fans' verdictpublished at 09:2809:28Image source, Getty ImagesWe asked for your thoughts after Sunday's Premier League game between Bournemouth and Manchester United.Here are some of your replies:Bournemouth fansMatt: A perfectly good game of football ruined by VAR and the referee. It feels like a walk in history with Fergie time and big club, little club. I thought we were beyond this. A shocking officiating performance. Bournemouth need some depth in their squad though and that back-up goalscorer.Barry: The draw was a fair result. I will be interested to see how many comments there are from fans of other teams.Michael: The Bournemouth player never deserved to be sent off - he slipped over. The standard of refereeing throughout was poor and influenced the result in Manchester United's favour. I'm not a Bournemouth fan, but a neutral. This is just another example of poor refereeing.Dom: With the competition in the Premier League and the expected departures, there is no guarantee we can compete for a European spot again next season, especially given how poor some of the big clubs have been and there being five Champions League spots. Having what could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity ripped from our hands by VAR - I'm also thinking back to the disallowed handball goal against Nottingham Forest on the first day of the season - is absolutely gut-wrenching.Man Utd fansJohn: It's embarrassing to see United struggle against teams like Bournemouth. They are a team that we should be steamrolling. Top four is a pipe dream for us. Why is Ruben Amorim sticking with systems that do not work?Derek: United only look like scoring when they have to throw players forward. The gap between defence, midfield and the front line was massive for all of the first half. When we sacrifice a defender to attack, it looks like a proper Man Utd team. Please wake up to this simple fact, Ruben Amorim.Chris: The team need to start finding consistency in level of performance, and begin managing and controlling games. I am fully behind the coach but his methods and playing style need to be more evident soon to ease the pressure. But for now, bring on Bilbao!Eric: We were lucky. It's great that Luke Shaw is fit but Alejandro Garnacho, Andre Onana and Mason Mount need to be sold because they didn't impact the game, Onana wasn't focused and he is not alert, Mount didn't do much while Garnacho doesn't run down the wing or take players on. But we also need to stop playing out from defence!Kevin: Shaw, Mount, Casemiro, Victor Lindelof and company are going to cost Amorim his job and he will deserve it - if for no other reason than him claiming there has been progress under his watch.Margaret: Not many thoughts. What's going to happen now? Surely this manager cannot remain. The good players that we have will not work with him. There must be a reason for their unwillingness to train properly or something. Maybe the bosses should ask the players that question. There will be no European football next year - how long can you afford to wait before you get the message?Catch up on the Premier League actionpublished at 07:4407:44Highlights and analysis from Sunday's two Premier League fixtures, plus the best of the action from the rest of the weekend.If you missed Match of the Day 2, catch up now on BBC iPlayer.And you can watch Saturday's Match of the Day here.Listen back to the weekend's full match commentaries on BBC Sounds:Bournemouth 1-1 Manchester UnitedLiverpool 5-1 Tottenham00:05'Ironically the ref gets this right' - pundits on Evanilson red card.

This win would have meant a lot to us and a point is a big difference."On the red card: "It's common sense. Everyone who has played football understands - he slips. He doesn't catch him with the leg that goes high and the consequence is a red card. It is another three games without playing. The repercussions for us are huge."Of course we are going to appeal. It is common sense. In the first half, Evanilson gets a kick in the chest by Casemiro. I don't think you should have a red card for this but VAR cuts the worst angle, the worst frame."On suggestions that VAR did not tell the referee that Evanilson had slipped: "If you're telling me that, then it is something very serious. It is difficult for us."On the race for European football: "We are in a worse position than at the start of the weekend, but we still have four games to play. They are difficult games but we are in the fight."It is difficult to look in a positive way at the moment, we need a few hours."'A bit of a dagger to concede the goal at the end'published at 16:37 27 April16:37 27 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesBournemouth midfielder Alex Scott has been speaking to Premier League Productions about the draw: "We worked so hard throughout the whole game. We played really well, especially in the first half. It is obviously unfortunate with the red card and then you've got to dig in."It's tough against a Manchester United team who haven't had the best of seasons, but they are still Manchester United. It's a bit of a dagger to concede the goal at the end."We gave everything in that game. We maybe didn't create enough chances, which is something we have lacked a bit recently. To concede after nine minutes were added on - I don't know where nine minutes came from - but you have got to take it on the chin."On Evanilson's red card: "I could see on the pitch that he slipped. It looked like the referee didn't want to give [the red card], but once he went to the screen we knew he was more likely to give it."On Bournemouth's European football hopes: "The results yesterday didn't help. We knew we had to come here and get three points, but we'll take the one. We've played well all season, so it would be a shame to let it slip in our remaining games."Bournemouth 1-1 Man Utd: Key statspublished at 16:27 27 April16:27 27 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesAndoni Iraola is unbeaten in all four of his Premier League meetings with Manchester United (W2 D2), with the Red Devils becoming the fifth different team the Spaniard has faced four or more times and not lost against.Evanilson has been involved in six goals in his past nine Premier League starts for Bournemouth (5 goals, 1 assist). This was his first assist in the competition on what was his 27th appearance.'I have full belief that we can still do something'published at 16:20 27 April16:20 27 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesBournemouth winger Antoine Semenyo has been speaking to Sky Sports about the performance: "It is frustrating. We dominated most of the game. We went down to 10 men but I felt we were still quite comfortable. We defended so well. The goal we conceded is so frustrating. It feels like a loss, to be honest."I feel like there wasn't much more we could do. All we could do was defend as a group and hope not to concede. We are just unfortunate to concede with the last shot they had."The teams above us can lose next week and we can go above them. We just have to go on to next week. We have a tough game [against Arsenal], but the boys will be confident enough going to the Emirates."It is not getting easier, but I have full belief that we can still do something."On Evanilson's red card: "Everyone's just frustrated. There were challenges like that all game. It doesn't make sense as to why that one was a red card."Bournemouth 1-1 Man Utd - send us your thoughtspublished at 15:58 27 April15:58 27 AprilWere you at the game or following from elsewhere?Have your say on Bournemouth's performanceWhat did you make of Man Utd's display?Come back to this page on Monday to find a selection of your repliesFollow Sunday's Premier League games livepublished at 13:03 27 April13:03 27 AprilTwo matches make up Sunday's Premier League action and BBC Sport will bring you every kick.Bournemouth v Man Utd (14:00) - follow all the action hereLiverpool v Tottenham (16:30) - follow all the action hereAll kick-off times BSTListen to live commentary of both games on BBC Radio 5 LiveSutton's predictions: Bournemouth v Manchester Unitedpublished at 12:18 27 April12:18 27 AprilBournemouth hammered Manchester United 3-0 at Old Trafford before Christmas and they have to be heavy favourites to win this game too.United travel to play Athletic Bilbao in the first leg of their Europa League semi-final next Thursday, and Ruben Amorim has already spoken about how he will prioritise that competition over the Premier League.So, Amorim will play more younger players here and on top of that, although Bournemouth are not on a great run of results, they are still in better form than United are.I am backing Bournemouth and it is going to be tough for United against Bilbao too.Bilbao got the better of Rangers in the last round and I am expecting two pretty tight games.Rangers did have some opportunities, though, so United have got a chance if they can click going forward. Having the second leg at Old Trafford will help Amorim's side, too.Sutton's prediction: 2-1Read the full predictions and have your say here'There is something special on the horizon'published at 12:02 26 April12:02 26 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesBournemouth technical director Simon Francis believes this season is just the start for the Cherries, who want to continue to grow into a Premier League force.Andoni Iraola's side are eighth in the league, having returned to the division in 2022. They host Manchester United at 14:00 BST on Sunday."Breaking records is always a good thing," said former defender Francis. "The club is in an amazing position in the league. "We have had an amazing season but to sustain it is the hardest part. It's the business end of the season. We have a tough run of fixtures, but it is in our hands. The players know that."They have got a real togetherness and mentality that I've not really seen before at this football club. They know there is something special on the horizon, whether it is this season or the next couple of years."Staying in the Premier League was the first and most important achievement, but this group have a really nice blend of experience and young players who are hungry to succeed."Francis also heaped praise on Iraola, who has transformed the Cherries into a relentless pressing machine with a clinical edge."He is enjoying being here, and if you asked him that, he would say the same," said Francis."Moving to the new training ground has been a big plus for him - the ambition the club has shown, the motivation of the players and because of what the future looks like. "We are in contact every day and we discuss everything. We just try to give him the best environment possible for him and the team to perform."I think he is in the best place - not only for his career but the team at the moment."'We are victims of our own success' - Bournemouth technical directorpublished at 18:04 25 April18:04 25 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesBournemouth's technical director Simon Francis says that interest in the club's star players is testament to the job the Cherries have done with recruitment, and the performance of Andoni Iraola's team.Bournemouth are eighth in the Premier League and players such as Dean Huijsen, Milos Kerkez and Antoine Semenyo are just three of the players rumoured to have attracted the gaze of clubs across Europe."We end up being a victim of our own success really," he said."There will be bigger teams circling around and looking at some of our players. There will be some situations we can't control, but there will be others we can. "I'm confident that if we finish well this season, and that could mean European football, then the players will be excited about that. It would be historic. "But there will also be some players that want to go and play for some of the biggest teams in the world, and sometimes you can't stand in their way. "All we can hope now is that we finish this season on a high. The players are focused on that - I don't think their attention is anywhere else at the moment. Then we have to accept that in the summer, there will be discussions."On 20-year-old Huijsen, who only arrived at Vitality Stadium from Juventus in the summer, Francis said: "He's had an amazing season. His most impressive attribute is his mentality. Everyone is aware of the noise around him but for him to stay so focused at his age has been admirable."He's not once changed his mentality around the group. I think that's partly down to the fact the group will keep him grounded anyway because we are a team and no individual is bigger than the team."The idea was for him to come in as back-up and learn, but through injury there was the opportunity for him to come into the team and he's been there ever since."For a player who has just turned 20, he reads the game and plays the game like he is 30 years old. He's impressive."17:32 25 AprilBournemouth agree deal to buy back stadium, published at 17:32 25 AprilBournemouth agree deal to buy back stadiumAttributionBournemouthThe answerpublished at 16:55 25 April16:55 25 AprilImage source, PA MediaEarlier, we asked you to name the current Bournemouth player from a series of clues.The correct answer is Tyler Adams.16:23 25 AprilRibbon cut on £32m AFC Bournemouth  training centre, published at 16:23 25 AprilRibbon cut on £32m AFC Bournemouth  training centreAttributionDorsetIraola on Cook's injury, Huijsen rumours and Europepublished at 14:58 25 April14:58 25 AprilMaisie GallenBBC Sport journalistBournemouth boss Andoni Iraola has been speaking to the media before Sunday's Premier League game against Manchester United (kick-off 14:00 BST).Here are the key lines from his news conference:Iraola expressed some doubts about Lewis Cook's availability due to an ongoing ankle issue which he was been struggling with.On what position will be good enough to qualify for Europe and how he approaches that: "We don't know what's going to happen or what position will give you access to Europe. There are seven teams comfortably ahead of us and three or four teams we are fighting with for a possible spot. We like to think that there is at least one position open but we know it will be difficult because we have a difficult schedule."He knows that the gap is widening and there are "a lot of teams fighting for one position" so you have to get "good results and try to win every game".He doesn't think the speculation around Antoine Semenyo  and Milos Kerkez is affecting the team, adding: "The players are focused on what they have to do and there are some things you cannot control, but it is not affecting us."Iraola believes Dean Huijsen can "block out" transfer rumours and said that he has been "training and playing well as usual".On opponents Manchester United: "They don't change their structure a lot. I expect a tight game. They defend well and don't give you a lot of chances so we have to be prepared for the best possible Manchester United team."In response to whether he thinks United will have more focus on their Europa League semi-final: "Thursday is important for them, of course, but they will want to beat us on Sunday also and so we have prepared for their strongest 11."Iraola was "very pleased" with the recent back-to-back clean sheets and was happy with the points gained from their matches against Crystal Palace and Fulham, adding: "It is important to keep adding points and if you are strong defensively, then it allows you to create chances. Our defensive numbers have been really good and we are not conceding cheap goals like we did last season."Follow all of Friday's Premier League news conferences and the rest of the day's football news.
