I think he's a fantastic player and for him to have that moment after some of the disappointments he's had this year is fantastic."14:53 26 AprilLuton out of bottom three with win over Coventry, published at 14:53 26 AprilLuton out of bottom three with win over CoventryAttributionChampionshipComments53522:24 25 AprilCrews tackle fire at Luton Town laundry room, published at 22:24 25 AprilCrews tackle fire at Luton Town laundry roomAttributionEngland16:41 25 AprilLuton's Kaminski hopes to play despite father's death, published at 16:41 25 AprilLuton's Kaminski hopes to play despite father's deathAttributionLutonPick of the stats: Luton Town v Coventry Citypublished at 09:45 25 April09:45 25 AprilLuton Town picked up a vital win over Bristol City last time out and will need to repeat their heroics against another play-off contender in Coventry City on Saturday (12:30 BST).While Monday's victory wasn't enough to see them out of the bottom three, it did put the Hatters level on points with Derby County above them, giving them a possible shot of escaping the relegation zone this weekend.But Coventry's play-off battle could also go down to the wire, with Middlesbrough in prime position to oust them from their sixth spot should they fail to pick up points at Kenilworth Road.Having lost to bottom dwellers Plymouth Argyle in their previous match, the Sky Blues will be looking to stop a second successive defeat to a lower-table team just as much as Luton will be seeking a double upset at the top.Luton have lost just one of their last 10 league games against Coventry (W4 D5), though it was in the reverse fixture in October (3-2).Following their 3-2 win in October, Coventry are looking to complete their first league double over Luton since 2005-06.Luton have won consecutive league games for the first time since September. They last won three in a row in March 2023.Coventry have lost three of their last four away league games (D1), having won four in a row on the road before this.Haji Wright has scored five goals in his last seven Championship appearances, while he also scored Coventry's 90th minute winner against Luton in the reverse fixture.08:05 25 AprilEFL Preview: Points win prizes in survival scrap, published at 08:05 25 AprilEFL Preview: Points win prizes in survival scrapAttributionFootballComments94Luton have given themselves a chance of staying uppublished at 10:06 24 April10:06 24 AprilGeoff DoyleBBC 3CR sports editorImage source, Getty ImagesTwo wins out of two over Easter has given Luton's chances of staying up a massive boost.They know that if they beat Coventry on Saturday in the early kick-off they will be outside the relegation zone come the final day of the season with their nearest rivals Hull and Derby playing each other later that day. What an incentive. What a turnaround.The Hatters went into the Good Friday match at Derby knowing that anything less than a win would almost certainly mean relegation. Luton dogged that one out and then they produced a fine performance on Easter Monday against Bristol City to achieve maximum points across the long weekend.This is a different team to the side which struggled for the first six months of the season where the players had a touch of the Premier League prima donnas about them and a manager struggling to cope.Matt Bloomfield has imposed his style on the team and brought a structure and shape required in the Championship. Most importantly he's offered clear and precise instructions and tactics.It's absurdly simplistic; the players seem to know what they're doing now - what the plan is - whereas before they looked confused and at a loss as to why they were so off-form.That malaise was allowed to deepen which led to further, wider problems. Poor attitudes, lack of motivation, lack of care, feeling sorry for themselves.Bloomfield has addressed all that and gone back to basics. He also recognised immediately the unmotivated players weren't fit enough. It may have been a reason as well for so many muscle injuries Luton were picking up before he arrived. Stamina levels are much much better now.Luton are still likely to need at least four points from their remaining two games and as we've seen with the Championship all season you can never predict results in this league.Because of the other match, no matter what happens on Saturday it will go down to the final game next week for Luton. The job is not done yet but it looks a hell of a lot better than it has done for most of the season.Commentary on Saturday from 12:00 BST on BBC Three Counties Radio 05:15 24 April'Who knows where' - Lockyer's future uncertain, published at 05:15 24 April'Who knows where' - Lockyer's future uncertainAttributionChampionship'We've been written off' - Bloomfieldpublished at 16:46 23 April16:46 23 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Matt Bloomfield left Wycombe to join Luton in JanuaryLuton Town are comfortable with their Championship survival hopes having been written off, says boss Matt Bloomfield.The Hatters have won their past two games, and only goal difference is keeping them in the relegation zone."We've been written off many times, which is fine," Bloomfield told the BBC's EFL podcast 72+"Football is all about opinions, but to lead a life in football, resilience is a crucial characteristic, and every time you get knocked down, you have to pick yourselves up and keep fighting."Luton have two games of the season remaining, at home to Coventry on Saturday (12:30 BST) and then away at West Brom on 3 May."We're still below the line and know there's a huge amount of work to be done to get ourselves above it by the end of the season," added Bloomfield."We're very pleased with the way the last couple of months have gone, but there's lots more work to be done - we've got our feet firmly on the ground, we've got two really tough games coming up, but we believe in the work we're doing."You can listen to all episodes of 72+ on BBC Sounds.08:57 22 AprilMorris a 'massive player' for Luton - Bloomfield, published at 08:57 22 AprilMorris a 'massive player' for Luton - BloomfieldAttributionLuton'Best result since I've been here' - Bloomfieldpublished at 18:59 21 April18:59 21 AprilImage source, Rex FeaturesImage caption, Luton Town have won their last two games but remain 22nd and level on points with Derby above themLuton boss Matt Bloomfield said that his side's victory over Bristol City was "possibly the best" since his arrival. The Hatters scored three second half goals to win 3-1 but still remain in the Championship's bottom three. "It's possibly the best result and performance since I've been here." He told BBC Three Counties Radio."It was edgy in the first-half but we stayed calm with it at half-time and spoke to the players about a couple of tactical things we wanted to adjust."It's a big result - I've felt we've been due a big home win because we've had some good performances and not got the rewards I've thought we should have so I'm really pleased we've managed to do that."We've got to focus on our own work - we'd all like results elsewhere (today) to be different but games are running out and we have to make sure we focus on ourselves and facing Coventry on Saturday."16:59 21 AprilLuton shock Bristol City but remain in drop zone, published at 16:59 21 AprilLuton shock Bristol City but remain in drop zoneAttributionChampionshipComments303'Nothing is done yet' - Bloomfieldpublished at 15:53 18 April15:53 18 AprilImage source, Rex FeaturesLuton Town boss Matt Bloomfield spoke to BBC Three Counties Radio after the Hatters beat relegation rivals Derby County 1-0 to give their hopes of Championship survival a major boost."I thought first half, for an away performance, we were excellent," he said. "We passed the ball incredibly well, we had a goal threat and the only disappointment is that we didn't come in two or three up to kill the game off."It was always going to be a tough second half with Derby supporters right behind their team and creating the noise they do here."But to put on that kind of defensive display, I'm so proud of the lads. We took a real punch on the nose last Saturday in the defeat against Blackburn, but I didn't want it to ruin the momentum we had been building."It was important that we kept our heads today, because if we got too uptight and anxious, and built it up to be too much, then we weren't going to come and perform. It was really important that we stayed calm in this situation."I've just delivered the message to the boys that nothing is done yet, just like it wasn't over last Saturday when we were beaten by Blackburn."We have to show that fighting spirit at the Kenny [Kenilworth Road against Bristol City] on Monday."14:30 18 AprilAlli's goal gives Luton vital win at Derby, published at 14:30 18 AprilAlli's goal gives Luton vital win at DerbyAttributionChampionshipComments29814:44 17 AprilLuton understand 'implications' of Derby game - Bloomfield, published at 14:44 17 AprilLuton understand 'implications' of Derby game - BloomfieldAttributionLuton14:24 17 AprilEFL preview: Easter crunch time at top and bottom, published at 14:24 17 AprilEFL preview: Easter crunch time at top and bottomAttributionFootballComments103Pick of the stats: Derby County v Luton Townpublished at 12:10 17 April12:10 17 AprilOnly one defeat in their past seven games and a tally of 14 points from a possible 21 has given Derby County under John Eustace a real chance of staying up.The Rams are one point clear of the drop zone with four games to go.Luton are scrapping to avoid a second straight relegation after a troubled campaign and know a win over Derby, although not enough to get out of the bottom three, would take them level on points with the Rams and behind them only on goal difference.It's a huge game at lunchtime on Good Friday (12:30 BST) for both sides' chances of being in the Championship next season.Derby are unbeaten in their past 10 home league games against Luton (W5 D5) since a 3-2 defeat at the Baseball Ground in May 1990.Luton are looking for their first league double over Derby since the 1989-90 top-flight campaign.Derby have won each of their past four league games on Good Friday and are the only team to win on that day in every season between 2020-21 and 2023-24.Luton have won two of their past 14 league games on Good Friday (D7 L5) but are unbeaten in their past two (W1 D1).Derby's Jerry Yates has scored nine Championship goals this season, only in 2022-23 has he ever reached double figures in the competition (14 with Blackpool).08:31 17 AprilWho will avoid relegation from the Championship?, published at 08:31 17 AprilWho will avoid relegation from the Championship?AttributionChampionshipComments170'Survival would be Luton's greatest escape yet'published at 08:26 17 April08:26 17 AprilSimon OxleyBBC 3CR, Luton Town commentatorImage source, Rex FeaturesThere may be four games to go but, in truth, the inquest is already under way for many Luton fans. After a slow start since replacing Rob Edwards, manager Matt Bloomfield had put together a decent run of results and Saturday's defeat at home by Blackburn was supposed to be the game they would win to get back into contention to stay up. But it was a real disappointment.No disrespect to Blackburn, but they were out of form and still managed to win despite playing nearly half the game with 10 men.So, with the remaining home games being against play-off chasing Bristol City and Coventry, there is not a lot of optimism around. Coventry sending them down would of course be very ironic given Luton's Wembley shootout victory over the Sky Blues to win promotion to the Premier League in 2023.The two away games are at fellow strugglers Derby on Good Friday, with a final day trip - if it comes to that - to play-off chasing West Bromwich Albion.They will be without two of the stand-out players from the Premier League season – Elijah Adebayo and Alfie Doughty – who have suffered recent injuries, so it will be up to January recruits like Thelo Aasgaard and Milli Alli to step up.Supporters are already questioning why there wasn't more recruitment last summer and whether the club kept faith with Edwards for too long.Luton stayed in the Championship on the last day in 2020. To do so again would be a greater escape.Derby six-pointer is a 'must-win game' - Clarkpublished at 16:49 15 April16:49 15 AprilImage source, Rex FeaturesLuton Town midfielder Jordan Clark says the trip to Championship relegation rivals Derby County on Good Friday is a "must-win game".The Hatters are 23rd and three points from safety below the Rams, who occupy 21st position, ahead of the clash at Pride Park.Clark said Saturday's 1-0 defeat at home to Blackburn was a "tough one to take" and that "a lack of cutting edge in the final third killed us".It's been a familiar theme for Luton who have scored fewer goals (37) than any other side in the league this season."Disappointed with the lack of quality and decision-making in the final third which we work on every day and it's been a bit of a problem for us this season really," Clark said."[If] you get a point, then Friday's game is a massive game because then you're going there to get out of the relegation zone, which obviously with the goal difference we can't, which is disappointing."Perhaps the only silver lining for Luton is that the sides directly above them in the survival scrap didn't fully capitalise as Cardiff lost, while Derby, Hull and Portsmouth all drew."You've got to look for favours around, which you shouldn't do but sometimes you have to," Clark added."It's one of them now, Friday is obviously a must-win game. It'll be a great atmosphere, a great game to play in and we need the three points."Luton weren't good enough against Blackburn - Bloomfieldpublished at 19:09 12 April19:09 12 AprilImage source, Rex FeaturesImage caption, Luton had gone five games unbeaten - their best run of the season - before losing to BlackburnLuton Town boss Matt Bloomfield said his side were below par in the home defeat against Blackburn Rovers. "We really felt we were building momentum and our performances have been good," Bloomfield told BBC Three Counties Radio."But that wasn't good enough for the standards we have been setting and we are very disappointed. "Blackburn have had a tough run of results but they have a very good group of players."We gave a goal away just after half-time which gave us a mountain to climb and we lacked that bit of composure at the top of the pitch. "There were loads of final-third entries and we hit the bar twice but we have not been clinical enough to get the equaliser and then chase the winner."We believe in the group we have. We've had some tough moments and have always come out the other side and it's up to us to do it again."With four games remaining, the result leaves the Hatters next to bottom of the table, effectively four points from safety with their poor goal difference.17:15 12 AprilLuton lose to 10-man Blackburn to deepen troubles, published at 17:15 12 AprilLuton lose to 10-man Blackburn to deepen troublesAttributionChampionshipComments153Managers must 'respect and love' their clubspublished at 17:58 11 April17:58 11 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Matt Bloomfield left his job at Wycombe to take the manager role at LutonLuton Town's Matt Bloomfield says it is important that managers "respect and love" their surroundings, whichever club employs them, to have a chance of finding the right formula for success.Bloomfield left a League One promotion race with Wycombe Wanderers in January to step up a division and take charge of The Hatters.Luton have taken 15 points from the 15 matches Bloomfield has overseen, but they are only two points from safety with five to play."Every club is different, every job is different, and you have to respect and love your surroundings and give supporters a team they can resonate with, that they can feel really represents them. That's really important to know," he told BBC Three Counties Radio.Tightening up their defence was an immediate priority when Bloomfield was appointed, but Luton remain next to bottom ahead of Saturday's home game against Blackburn."The job we built over a number of transfer windows at my previous club, you were able to get it to a place where it was attack-minded first," he added."We looked at the numbers when we came in (here) and the goals against was too many and we felt there were improvements that just had to be made. To win games and get points, we needed to tighten up at the back."That had to be our main focus so we played a couple of different formations and tries to make them suit the players we have available, and try and play in a character and style of football and a philosophy that suits the club and the group."Bloomfield confirmed that forward Elijah Adebayo had now had surgery on the ACL injury suffered in last weekend's draw with Leeds."It's the first step. I've done the (same) injury myself so I'm hoping I can really connect with him on that level, I've been through that process. It's a long road but what I do know about Eli is he's a really courageous young man and against Leeds he was unplayable at times." previous pagePage 1 of 42123456…42next pageHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright © 2025 BBC.
