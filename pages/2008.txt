Police appeared to successfully call for the crowd to move away.The minivan was also carrying a child and at least one other passenger.PA MediaHundreds of people rallied in Westminster on Saturday afternoon for Just Stop Oil's "last day of action"People standing front of the vehicle, some holding a JSO banner, were seen holding their hands up, with one shouting to the police "officer, I'm being pushed back".The driver exited the vehicle and could be heard remonstrating with the protesters about the road being blocked.Police reminded the man the disruption was temporary and people had a right to protest.Other similar incidents of drivers apparently becoming frustrated with people in the road were also caught on camera.In its March statement announcing the end of direct action, the group said: "Just Stop Oil's initial demand to end new oil and gas is now government policy, making us one of the most successful civil resistance campaigns in recent history."We've kept over 4.4 billion barrels of oil in the ground and the courts have ruled new oil and gas licences unlawful."EPAThe Labour government has said it will not issue licences for new oil and gas explorationThe Labour government has said it will not issue licences for new oil and gas exploration, while a series of recent court cases have halted fossil fuel projects including oil drilling in Surrey, a coal mine in Cumbria and the Rosebank and Jackdaw fields in the North Sea over climate pollution.Labour has distanced itself from Just Stop Oil, with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer criticising its actions and saying protesters must face the full force of the law.The Metropolitan Police have been approached for comment.Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.
