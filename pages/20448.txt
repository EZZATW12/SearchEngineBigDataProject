From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Auxiliary input/output device for a computer
This article is about a type of hardware device. For other uses, see Periphery.
"Computer peripherals" redirects here. For the American printer manufacturer, see Computer Peripherals.
This article relies largely or entirely on a single source. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please help improve this article by introducing  citations to additional sources.Find sources: "Peripheral" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR (April 2023)
A peripheral  device, or simply peripheral, is an auxiliary hardware device that a computer uses to transfer information externally.[1] A peripheral is a hardware component that is accessible to and controlled by a computer but is not a core component of the computer.
A peripheral can be categorized based on the direction in which information flows relative to the computer:

The computer receives data from an input device; examples: mouse, keyboard, scanner, game controller, microphone and webcam
The computer sends data to an output device; examples: monitor, printer, headphones, and speakers
The computer sends and receives data via an input/output device; examples: storage device (such as disk drive, solid-state drive, USB flash drive, memory card and tape drive), modem, router, gateway and network adapter
Many modern electronic devices, such as Internet-enabled digital watches, video game consoles, smartphones, and tablet computers, have interfaces for use as a peripheral.
