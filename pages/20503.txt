The Acer AspireRevo nettop
A mini PC (or miniature PC, nettop, or Smart Micro PC) is a small-sized, inexpensive,[1] low-power,[2][3] legacy-free desktop computer designed for basic tasks such as web browsing, accessing web-based applications, document processing, and audio/video playback.[4][5][6]
The word nettop is a portmanteau of network and desktop. It is the desktop counterpart of the netbook. Modern (c. 2020) mini PCs or small form factor PCs can be much more powerful, being equipped with high-end laptop components or mid-range desktop components.[7][8]
Compared with ordinary desktop computers, nettops are not only smaller and less expensive,[9] but they also consume much less power. For example, CompuLab's fit-PC2 consumes no more than 8 watts of power[10] whereas a typical desktop would easily consume more than 100 watts of power; consequently, nettops require significantly less cooling and may even be completely fanless. Some do not have an optical disk drive and use a solid-state drive, making them completely silent. The tradeoff is that the hardware specifications and processing power are usually reduced[11] and hence make nettops less appropriate for running complex or resource-intensive applications.


Hardware[edit]
Mac Mini 2020 (M1)
There are several platforms that are primarily intended for nettops and netbooks:

Intel's Atom platform[12]
Nvidia's Ion platform[13]
Intel's Core platform
AMD's APU platform
VIA's Trinity Platform[14]
There are several mini PC platforms:

Apple Mac mini
Intel / ASUS NUC
Some nettops have also adopted system-on-a-chip designs. Although many major parts such as chipsets, video cards and storage devices can also be found on desktops, the CPUs that are put inside nettops are the fundamental component that differentiate them from normal desktops. The list below contains a range of hardware components that a typical nettop may be assembled from.

CPU
Intel Atom, Intel Core (x86)
VIA Nano and VIA C7 processors (x86)
AMD APU (x86)
AMD Geode (x86)
ARM Cortex-based CPU (ARM)
Loongson (MIPS)
GPU
Intel GMA 950
Intel UHD Graphics
S3 Graphics Chrome
GeForce 9400M G (integrated into MCP79MX; Nvidia Ion platform)
AMD Radeon HD 6310
ATI Radeon HD 4530
PowerVR
Chipset
945GSE and 945GC Express chipsets
MCP79MX (integrated GeForce 9400M G GPU; Nvidia Ion platform)
VIA VX800 IGP Chipset
Storage devices
2.5" hard disk drive
Solid-state drive (SSD)
Network
Ethernet and/or Wi-Fi
I/O ports
LAN, USB, video out, audio out
Intel's Atom processor has been adopted by several hardware manufacturers, such as ASUS, MSI, and Sony, for nettops. Nvidia has also released its first generation ION platform, which puts GeForce 9400M Motherboard GPU alongside the Atom processor to provide better high definition video playback ability and lower power consumption.[15] In addition, Nvidia has announced that it will support VIA's CPUs this year.[16] To further reduce the manufacturing cost and improve power efficiency, many manufacturers and start-up companies have chosen to use CPUs that were originally targeted at embedded computing devices such as AMD's Geode and ARM Cortex-based CPUs.

Operating systems[edit]
Many net-top models are x86-processor-based and as such are capable of running standard PC OSes. There are also operating systems designed specifically for nettops and other machines in the same performance class. Some high-end nettops are capable of running Windows 10.[17] Linux, Android, ChromeOS, and Raspberry Pi OS are other options. Although Google's Android was originally designed for smartphones, it has also taken a seat in the nettop market.[18]

Market[edit]
Nettops fell into Intel's category of "Basic PC", which usually cost from $100 to $299.[19] Intel described nettops as a large potential market at that time. Nettops were said to be able to serve as an affordable first computer for people in developing countries, or as an environmentally friendly choice as a secondary computer for people in developed countries.[20]

^ Brookes, Tim (30 March 2023). "5 Reasons You Should Buy a Mini PC (and 3 Reasons Not To)". How-To Geek. Retrieved 2 February 2025. You could save money with a mini PC and get just as much performance out of it and maybe more versatility. Even the relatively speaking pricey $599 entry-level Mac mini M2 supports two displays (three if you opt for the M2 Pro version). If you bomb Amazon for deals you can pick up two 1080p monitors for around $160 for a total spend of $759. By comparison, the cheapest MacBook Air is $999.

^ "What is a Mini PC and Can it Handle Gaming?". lenovo.com. A mini-PC is a compact version of a desktop computer. They usually have enough power for everyday tasks like web browsing, office applications, and media playback. Because of their size, they often use lower power components, which makes them quieter and more energy-efficient than their full-size counterparts.

^ Smith, Ernie. "Mini PCs: What Are They, and How Can You Use Them in the Workplace?". BizTech. Retrieved 2 February 2025. Generally, mini PCs leverage processing power more commonly seen in laptops and similarly low-powered solutions, but they tend to have more connectivity and upgradability options.
