Professional association

The Association for Information Systems (AIS) is an international, not-for-profit, professional association for scholars of information systems that was established in 1994.[2][3] The association publishes journals, organizes conferences, and provides a forum for information systems professors and managers. It has members in more than 100 countries.[3]
The association is led by a president who is annually elected from one of three world regions—the Americas, Europe and Africa and Asia-Pacific—on a rotating basis. The governing council is made up of elected functional vice-presidents and other officers and council members who are elected in the three world regions.[2]
The association organizes four annual conferences for IS researchers, educators and students: The International Conference on Information Systems (ICIS), which alternates between the three world regions, and three regional conferences: the Americas Conference on Information Systems (AMCIS), the European Conference on Information Systems (ECIS), and the Pacific Asia Conference on Information Systems (PACIS).


European Conference on Information Systems[edit]

The European Conference on Information Systems (ECIS) is an annual conference for information systems and information technology academics and professionals and was affiliated with the AIS. The organization of the conference comes under the purview of the ECIS Standing Committee. After being an affiliated AIS conference for many years, ECIS now has officially been adopted as the World Region 2 (Europe, Africa and Middle East) conference for AIS since 2017.[4]
ECIS is considered to be one of the premier information systems event in the European region ,[5][6] and provides a platform for panel discussions and the presentation of peer-reviewed information systems research papers.[7][8] The conference more recently had acceptance rates in the low 30% range.[5] The electronic version of the conference proceedings (1993-2008-excluding 1995 and 1998) and full citations (1993-2008) are available publicly.
The first ECIS conference took place in 1993 in Henley-on-Thames, United Kingdom.
