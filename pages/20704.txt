ThinkCentre is a brand of business-oriented desktop computers, the early models of which were designed, developed and marketed by International Business Machines (IBM) since 2003. In 2005, IBM sold its PC business, including the ThinkCentre brand, to Lenovo. ThinkCentre computers typically include mid-range to high-end processors, options for discrete graphics cards, and multi-monitor support.[1]


History[edit]
Launch[edit]
IBM ThinkCentre used as a Linux server
The ThinkCentre line of desktop computers was introduced by IBM in 2003. The first three models in this line were the S50, the M50, and A50p.[2] All three desktops were equipped with Intel Pentium 4 processors.[2] The chassis was made of steel and designed for easy component access without the use of tools.[2] The hard disk was fixed in place by a 'caddy' without the use of screws.[2] The caddy had rubber bumpers to reduce vibration and operational noise.[2]
Additional updates to the desktops included greater use of ThinkVantage technologies.[2] All desktop models were made available with ImageUltra.[2] The three desktop models also included an 'Access IBM' button, allowing access to onboard resources, diagnostic tools, automated software, and links to online updates and services.[2] Select models featured IBM's Embedded Security Subsystem, with an integrated security chip and IBM Client Security Software.[2]

Acquisition by Lenovo[edit]
Main article: Acquisition of the IBM PC business by Lenovo
In 2005, after completing its acquisition of IBM's personal computing business, leading to the IBM/Lenovo partnership, IBM/Lenovo announced the ThinkCentre E Series desktops, designed specifically for small businesses.[3] The ThinkCentre E50 was made available in tower and small form factor, with a silver and black design.[3]
In 2005, Technology Business Research (TBR) observed an increase in the customer satisfaction rate for ThinkCentre desktops.[4] According to TBR's "Corporate IT Buying Behavior and Customer Satisfaction Study” published in the second quarter of 2005, Lenovo was the only one of four surveyed companies that displayed a substantial increase in ratings.[4]
In May 2005, the ThinkCentre M52 and A52 desktops were announced by Lenovo.[5] These desktops marked the first time the ThinkCentre line incorporated dual-core processors and 64-bit technology.[5] At the time of release, Lenovo also announced plans to incorporate Intel Active Management Technology (iAMT) in future products.[5]

Chromebox Tiny[edit]
The Chromebox Tiny is a small desktop computer with a Core i3-5005U processor, 4 gigabytes of memory, a 16 GB solid-state drive, integrated graphics that runs Google's ChromeOS. It was designed for education and business. Its largest side measures about 7 inches square. It is 1.4 inches thick and weighs 2.2 pounds. Computers with this form factor are called "one-liter" machines in some countries that use the metric system. The Tiny can be mounted on the back of monitors or placed on walls with a VESA mount. The Chromebox Tiny has two USB 3.0 ports on its front and two more on its rear.[10] Dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0 are both supported. An external antenna is included to improve reception. A mouse and keyboard come standard.[11]

It comes standard with one DisplayPort jack, and Ethernet port, five USB 3.0 ports, and a VGA port. There is a customizable port that can be configured with another DisplayPort jack, a serial port, another USB port, or an HDMI port. Wi-fi is 802.11ac. Wireless accessories are supported via Bluetooth 4.0.[12]

S50[edit]
ThinkCentre S50
In 2004, an ultra-small version of the S50 was announced, the smallest desktop PC introduced until that time by IBM.[13] The ultra-small ThinkCentre S50 desktop weighed approximately the same as IBM's first notebook (IBM 5140 PC Convertible).[13] The ultra-small desktop was roughly the size of a New York City phonebook, or a box of cereal.[14] The ultra-small desktop also featured a tool-free tool-less steel chassis and IBM ThinkVantage Technologies.[15]
