Robertson is one of the creators of the MacTutor History of Mathematics archive, along with John J. O'Connor. Robertson has written over 100 research articles, mainly on the theory of groups and semigroups. He is also the author or co-author of 17 textbooks.[1]
Robertson obtained a Bachelor of Science degree at the University of St Andrews in 1965. He then went to the University of Warwick, where he received a Master of Science degree in 1966 and a Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1968.[1]
In 1998, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.[2]
In 2015, he received together with his colleague O'Connor, the Hirst Prize of the London Mathematical Society for his work on the MacTutor History of Mathematics archive.[3] His thesis on "Classes of Generalised Nilpotent Groups" was done with Stewart E. Stonehewer.[4]

Personal life[edit]
He is with his wife, Helena, and his two sons.[5]
