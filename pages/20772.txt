Board-level circuit that integrates a system function in a single module

Typical SoC use in a system on a module circuit board
SoM block diagram example
A system on a module (SoM) is a board-level circuit that integrates a system function in a single module. It may integrate digital and analog functions on a single board.  A typical application is in the area of embedded systems. Unlike a single-board computer, a SoM serves a special function like a system on a chip (SoC). The devices integrated in the SoM typically requires a high level of interconnection for reasons such as speed, timing, bus width, etc. There are benefits in building a SoM, as for SoC; one notable result is to reduce the cost of the base board or the main PCB.  Two other major advantages of SoMs are design-reuse and that they can be integrated into many embedded computer applications.[further explanation needed]


History[edit]
The acronym SoM has its roots in the blade-based modules. In the mid 1980s, when VMEbus blades used M-Modules,[1] these were commonly referred to as system On a module (SoM).[citation needed] These SoMs performed specific functions such as compute functions and data acquisition functions. SoMs were used extensively by Sun Microsystems, Motorola, Xerox, DEC, and IBM in their blade computers.

Design[edit]
A typical SoM consists of:

at least one microcontroller, microprocessor or digital signal processor (DSP) core
multiprocessor systems-on-chip (MPSoCs) have more than one processor core
memory blocks including a selection of ROM, RAM, EEPROM and/or flash memory
timing sources
industry standard communication interfaces such as USB, FireWire, Ethernet, USART, SPI, I²C
peripherals including counter-timers, real-time timers and power-on reset generators
analog interfaces including analog-to-digital converters and digital-to-analog converters
voltage regulators and power management circuits
