The Computer Conservation Society (CCS) is a British organisation, founded in 1989. It is under the joint umbrella of the British Computer Society (BCS),[1] the London Science Museum and the Manchester Museum of Science and Industry.[2][3]


Overview[edit]
The CCS is interested in the history of computing in general and the conservation and preservation of early British historical computers in particular.[4]
The society runs a series of monthly public lectures between September and May each year in both London and Manchester.  The events are detailed on the society's website.[5]
The CCS publishes a quarterly journal, Resurrection.[6][7]
The society celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2014.[8][9]
Dr Doron Swade,[10] formerly the curator of the computing collection at the London Science Museum, was a founding committee member and As of 2021[update] is the current chair of the society. David Morriss, Rachel Burnett, and Roger Johnson are previous chairs, also all previous presidents of the BCS.

Projects[edit]
The society organises a number of projects to reconstruct and maintain early computers and to conserve early software. For example:

Restorations
Elliott 401
Elliott 803
Elliott 903 and 905
DEC Systems
Pegasus
ICT 1301 Project
