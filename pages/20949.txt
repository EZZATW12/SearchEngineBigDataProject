From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


This is a maintenance category, used for maintenance of the Wikipedia project. It is not part of the encyclopedia and contains non-article pages, or groups articles by status rather than subject. Do not include this category in content categories.
This is a hidden category. It is not shown on its member pages, unless the corresponding user preference (Appearance ‚Üí Show hidden categories) is set.
This category contains pages which have been indefinitely semi-protected from editing. Semi-protection prevents anonymous and newly registered users from editing; contributing accounts must be at least 4 days old and must have made at least 10 edits to non-protected pages (including deleted ones).
Use {{Pp-semi-indef}} to add pages to this category. This should only be done if the page is in fact semi-protected ‚Äì adding the template does not in itself protect the page.
