    Responsive Sidebar
  



  In this example, the side navigation will always be displayed on desktop computers and laptops (screens wider than 992px), and hidden on tablets and mobile phones (screens that are less than 992px wide).
  On tablets and mobile phones the side navigation is replaced with a menu icon that opens the navigation pane when clicked on: it will then overlay/sit on top of the page content.
  Resize the browser window to understand how it works.
