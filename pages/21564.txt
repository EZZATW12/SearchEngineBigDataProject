What are Emojis?
Emojis look like images, or icons, but they are not.
They are letters (characters) from the UTF-8 (Unicode) character set.

UTF-8 covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world.




The HTML charset Attribute
To display an HTML page correctly, a web browser must know the character set used in the page.
This is specified in the <meta> tag:


<meta charset="UTF-8">



If not specified, UTF-8 is the default character set in HTML.




UTF-8 Characters
Many UTF-8 characters cannot be typed on a keyboard,
but they can always be displayed using numbers (called entity numbers):

A is 65
B is 66
C is 67


Example

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<body>
<p>I will display A B C</p>
<p>I will display &#65; &#66; &#67;</p>
</body>
</html>

Try it Yourself »

Example Explained
The <meta charset="UTF-8"> element defines the character set.
The characters A, B, and C, are displayed by the numbers 65, 66, and 67.
To let the browser understand that you are displaying a character, you must start the entity number
with &# and end it with ; (semicolon).








Emoji Characters
Emojis are also characters from the UTF-8 alphabet:

😄 is 128516
😍 is 128525
💗 is 128151


Example

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<body>
<h1>My First Emoji</h1>
<p>&#128512;</p>
</body></html>

Try it Yourself »

Since Emojis are characters, they can be copied, displayed,
and sized just like any other character in HTML.

Example

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<body>
<h1>Sized Emojis</h1>
  <p style="font-size:48px">&#128512; &#128516; &#128525; &#128151;</p>
</body></html>
