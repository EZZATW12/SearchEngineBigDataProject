W3.CSS Fonts

❮ Previous
Next ❯


Verdana is the default font used in W3.CSS.
Verdana has a good letter spacing, and is easy to read. Verdana is also the default font for W3Schools.
Segoe UI is the default font for headings.
Segoe UI has a more narrow letter spacing. This allows for a few more letters in the headings.

Using Another Default Font
Using another default font in W3.CSS is very easy:

Example

body, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
  font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
}

Trebuchet MSArial, sans-serif


Arial is considered the safest sans-serif font on the web.
It is installed on all Windows machines (99.8%) and all Mac machines (98.7%).
Helvetica is the preferred fallback because the two fonts are almost identical.
Helvetica runs on all Mac machines (100%) but on fewer Windows machines (7.3%).
Using Arial with Helvetica fallback, or Helvetiva with Arial fallback, covers both worlds.
Verdana is also considered to be a web safe sans-serif font. It runs on all Windows machines
(99.8%), and all Mac Machines (99.1%).
Geneva is Verdanas preferred fallback, because the two fonts are quite similar,
and Geneva runs on all Mac machines (99.6%).
Tahoma was the standard font in Windows 95. It works on 99.9% of all Windows machines,
and 91.7% of all Mac machines.
Trebuchet MS has been released with all Windows operating systems (99.7%) since Microsoft Windows 2000.
It is also included on Macs machines (97.1%), iOS and Chrome OS.

Web Safe Serif Fonts


Font FamilySafe Fallback
Times New RomanTimes, serif
Georgiaserif


Times New Roman is considered the most web safe serif font.
It works on all Windows machines (99.7%) and all Mac machines (97.4%).
Some older operating systems might have an alternative version called Times,
so it is smart to use Times as a fallback as well as serif.
Georgia is also considered very safe. It is a little larger than Times New Roman,
but works well on most Windows machines (99.4%) and Mac machines (97.5%).
To be on the safe side, use serif as fallback.

In a monospace font, all letters occupy the same width.
Monospaced fonts are often used to display computer code.


Font FamilySafe Fallback
Courier Newmonospace
Lucida ConsoleMonaco, monospace
MonacoLucida Console, monospace



Courier New is considered the most web safe monospace font.
It is installed on most Windows and Mac machines.
Lucida Console does not run on Mac. Monaco does not run on Windows.
One solution is to use Monaco as fallback for Lucida Console.


There are no 100% web safe fonts, but you can always use w3-monospace.
