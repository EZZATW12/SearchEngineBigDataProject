HTML Entities

❮ Previous
Next ❯


Reserved characters in HTML must be replaced with entities:

< (less than) = &lt;
> (greater than) = &gt;



HTML Character Entities
Some characters are reserved in HTML.
If you use the less than (<) or greater than (>) signs in your HTML text, the browser might mix them with tags.
Entity names or entity numbers can be used to display reserved HTML characters.
Entity names look like this:


&entity_name;

Entity numbers look like this:


&#entity_number;

To display a less than sign (<) we must write: &lt; or &#60;

Entity names are easier to remember than entity numbers.




Non-breaking Space
A commonly used HTML entity is the non-breaking space: &nbsp;
A non-breaking space is a space that will not break into a new line.
Two words 
separated by a non-breaking space will stick together (not break into a new 
line). This 
is handy when breaking the words might be disruptive.
Examples:

§ 10
10 km/h
10 PM

Another common use of the non-breaking space is to prevent browsers from truncating spaces in HTML pages.
If you write 10 spaces in your text, the browser will remove 9 of them. To add real spaces to your text, 
you can use the &nbsp; character entity.

The non-breaking hyphen (&#8209;) 
is used to define a hyphen character (‑) that does not break into a new 
line.

Entity names are case sensitive.




Combining Diacritical Marks
A diacritical mark is a "glyph" added to a letter.
Some diacritical marks, like grave (  ̀) and acute (  ́) are called accents. 
Diacritical marks can be used in combination with alphanumeric characters to produce a character that is not present in 
the character set (encoding) used in the page.
Here are some examples:
