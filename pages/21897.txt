CSS Forms

❮ Previous
Next ❯


The look of an HTML form can be greatly improved with CSS:


First Name

Last Name

Country

Australia
Canada
USA

Try it Yourself »



Styling Input Fields
Use the width property to determine the width of the input field:
First Name


Example

input
{
  width: 100%;
}
Try it Yourself »

The example above applies to all <input> elements. If you only want to 
style a specific input type, you can use attribute selectors:

input[type=text] - will only select text fields
input[type=password] - will only select password fields
input[type=number] - will only select number fields
etc..







Padded Inputs
Use the padding property to add space inside the text field.
Tip: When you have many inputs after each other, you might 
also want to add some margin, to add more space 
outside of them:
First Name

Last Name


Example

input[type=text]
{
    width: 100%;  padding: 12px 20px;  margin: 8px 0;  
box-sizing: border-box;
}
Try it Yourself »


Note that we have set the box-sizing property to 
border-box. This makes sure that the padding and eventually borders are included in the 
total width and height of the elements. Read more about the box-sizing property in our CSS Box Sizing chapter.


Bordered Inputs
Use the border property to change the border size and color, and 
use the border-radius property to add rounded corners:
First Name


Example

input[type=text]
{  border: 2px solid red;  
border-radius: 4px;
}
Try it Yourself »

If you only want a bottom border, use the border-bottom property:
First Name


Example

input[type=text]
{  border: none;  
border-bottom: 2px solid red;
}
Try it Yourself »


Colored Inputs
Use the background-color property to add a background color to the input, and 
the color property to change the text color:


Example

input[type=text]
{  background-color: #3CBC8D;  color: white;
}
Try it Yourself »


Focused Inputs
By default, some browsers will add a blue outline around the input when it gets 
focus (clicked on). You can remove this behavior by adding outline: none; to the input.
Use the :focus selector to do something with the input field when it gets focus:




Example

input[type=text]:focus
{
  background-color: lightblue;
}
Try it Yourself »





Example

input[type=text]:focus
{

Input with icon/image
If you want an icon inside the input, use the background-image property and 
position it with the background-position property. Also notice that we 
add a 
large left padding to reserve the space of the icon:


Example

input[type=text]
{  background-color: white;  background-image: url('searchicon.png');  
background-position: 10px 10px;   background-repeat: 
no-repeat;  
padding-left: 40px;
}

Animated Search Input
In this example we use the CSS transition property to animate 
the width of the search input when it gets focus. You will learn more about the 
transition property later, in our CSS Transitions chapter.


Example

input[type=text] {  transition: width 0.4s ease-in-out;}input[type=text]:focus {
    
width: 100%;}

Styling Textareas
Tip: Use the resize property to prevent textareas from being resized (disable the "grabber" in the bottom right corner):

Some text...


Example

textarea
{  width: 100%;  height: 150px;  padding: 12px 20px;  
box-sizing: border-box;  border: 2px solid #ccc;  
border-radius: 4px;  background-color: #f8f8f8;  resize: none;
}

Responsive Form
Resize the browser window to see the effect. When the screen is less than 600px wide, make the two columns stack on top of each other instead of next to each other.

Advanced: The following example uses media queries to create a responsive form. You will learn more about this in a later chapter.
