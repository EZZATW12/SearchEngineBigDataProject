CSS Pseudo-elements

❮ Previous
Next ❯


What are Pseudo-Elements?
A CSS pseudo-element is used to style specific parts of an element.
For example, it can be used to:

Style the first letter or line, of an element
Insert content before or after an element
Style the markers of list items
Style the viewbox behind a dialog box


Syntax
The syntax of pseudo-elements:


selector::pseudo-element {  property: value;}


The ::first-line Pseudo-element
The ::first-line pseudo-element is used to add a special style 
to the first line of a text.
The following example formats the first line of the text in all <p> 
elements:

Example 

p::first-line 
{
   
color: #ff0000;
   
font-variant: small-caps;
}
Try it Yourself »

Note: The ::first-line pseudo-element can only be applied to block-level 
elements.
The following properties apply to the ::first-line 
pseudo-element:

font properties
color properties
background properties
word-spacing
letter-spacing
text-decoration
vertical-align
text-transform
line-height
clear


Notice the double colon notation -  ::first-line versus
:first-lineThe double colon replaced the single-colon 
notation for pseudo-elements in CSS3. This was an attempt from W3C to 
distinguish between pseudo-classes 
and pseudo-elements.The single-colon syntax was used 
for both pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements in CSS2 and CSS1.For 
backward compatibility, the single-colon syntax is acceptable for CSS2 and CSS1 
pseudo-elements.







The ::first-letter Pseudo-element
The ::first-letter pseudo-element is used to add a special style to the first 
letter of a text.
The following example formats the first letter of the text in all <p> 
elements: 

Example

p::first-letter 
{
   
color: #ff0000;
   
font-size: xx-large;
}
Try it Yourself »

Note: The ::first-letter pseudo-element can only be applied to block-level 
elements.
The following properties apply to the ::first-letter pseudo- element: 

 font properties
 color properties 
 background properties
margin properties
padding properties
border properties
text-decoration
vertical-align (only if "float" is "none")
text-transform
line-height
float
clear


Pseudo-elements and HTML Classes
Pseudo-elements can be combined with HTML classes:

In the following example, the first letter of a paragraph will be red, in 
an xx-large font size. The rest of the first line will be blue, and in 
small-caps. The rest of the paragraph will be the default font size and color:

{
  color: #ff0000;
  font-size: xx-large;
}
p::first-line 
{
   
color: #0000ff;
