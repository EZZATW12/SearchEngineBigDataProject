HTTP Request Methods

❮ Previous
Next ❯


What is HTTP?
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is designed to enable 
communications between clients and servers.
HTTP works as a request-response protocol between a client and server.
Example: A client (browser) sends an HTTP request to the server; then the server 
returns a response to the client. The response contains status information about 
the request and may also contain the requested content.

HTTP Methods

GET
POST
PUT
HEAD
DELETE
PATCH
OPTIONS
CONNECT
TRACE

The two most common HTTP methods are: GET and POST.

The GET Method
GET is used to request data from a specified 
resource.
Note that the query string (name/value pairs) is sent in the URL of 
a GET request:


/test/demo_form.php?name1=value1&name2=value2

Some notes on GET requests:

GET requests can be cached
GET requests remain in the browser history
GET requests can be bookmarked
GET requests should never be used when dealing with sensitive data
GET requests have length restrictions
GET requests are only used to request data (not modify)


The POST Method
POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.
The data sent to the server with POST is stored in the request body of the 
HTTP request:


POST /test/demo_form.php HTTP/1.1
Host: w3schools.com
   name1=value1&name2=value2

Some notes on POST requests:

POST requests are never cached
POST requests do not remain in the browser history
POST requests cannot be bookmarked
POST requests have no restrictions on data length


Compare GET vs. POST
The following table compares the two HTTP methods: GET and POST.



 
GET
POST


BACK button/Reload
Harmless
Data will be re-submitted (the browser should alert the user that the data are about to be re-submitted)


Bookmarked
Can be bookmarked
Cannot be bookmarked


Cached
Can be cached
Not cached


Encoding type
application/x-www-form-urlencoded
application/x-www-form-urlencoded or multipart/form-data. Use multipart encoding for binary data


History
Parameters remain in browser history
Parameters are not saved in browser history


Restrictions on data length
Yes, when sending data, the GET method adds the data to the URL; and the length of a URL is limited (maximum URL length is 2048 characters)
No restrictions


Restrictions on data type
Only ASCII characters allowed
No restrictions. Binary data is also allowed


Security
GET is less secure compared to POST because data sent is part of the URL

 Never use GET when sending passwords or other sensitive information!
POST is a little safer than GET because the parameters are not stored in browser history or in web server logs


Visibility
Data is visible to everyone in the URL
Data is not displayed in the URL









The PUT Method
PUT is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.
The difference between POST and PUT is that PUT requests are idempotent. That 
is, calling the same PUT request multiple times will always produce the same 
result. In contrast, calling a POST request repeatedly have side effects of 
creating the same resource multiple times.

The HEAD Method
HEAD is almost identical to GET, but without the response body.
In other words, if GET /users returns a list of users, then HEAD /users will 
make the same request but will not return the list of users.
A HEAD request is useful for checking what a GET request will return before 
actually making a GET request - a HEAD request can read the Content-Length 
header to check the size of the file, without actually downloading the file.

The DELETE Method
The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.

The PATCH Method
The PATCH method is used to apply partial modifications to a resource.

The OPTIONS Method
The OPTIONS method describes the communication options for the target 
resource.

The CONNECT Method
The CONNECT method is used to start a two-way communications (a tunnel) with 
the requested resource.

The TRACE Method
The TRACE method is used to perform a message loop-back test that 
tests the path for the target resource (useful for debugging purposes).
