HTML Images

❮ Previous
Next ❯


Images can improve the design and the appearance of a web page.










Example

 <img src="pic_trulli.jpg" 
alt="Italian Trulli">

Try it Yourself »


Example

 <img src="img_girl.jpg" 
alt="Girl in a jacket">
Try it Yourself »


Example

 <img src="img_chania.jpg" 
alt="Flowers in Chania">

Try it Yourself »



HTML Images Syntax
The HTML <img> tag is used to embed an 
image in a web page.
Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web 
pages. The <img> tag creates a holding 
space for the referenced image.
The <img> tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not 
have a closing tag.
The <img> tag has two required 
attributes:

src - Specifies the path to the image
alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image


Syntax

<img src="url" alt="alternatetext">




The src Attribute
The required src attribute specifies the path (URL) to the image.
Note: When a web page loads, it is the browser, at that 
moment, that gets the image from a web server and inserts it into the page. 
Therefore, make sure that the image actually stays in the same spot in relation 
to the web page, otherwise your visitors will get a broken link icon. The broken 
link icon and the alt text are shown if the browser cannot find the image.

Example

<img src="img_chania.jpg" alt="Flowers 
  in Chania">

The alt Attribute
The required alt attribute provides an alternate text for an image, if the user for 
some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src 
attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).
The value of the alt attribute should describe the image:

Example

<img src="img_chania.jpg" alt="Flowers 
  in Chania">

Try it Yourself »

If a browser cannot find an image, it will display the value of the alt 
attribute:

Example

<img src="wrongname.gif" alt="Flowers 
  in Chania">

Try it Yourself »


Tip: A screen reader is a software program that reads the HTML code, and allows the user to "listen" to the content. Screen readers are useful 
for people who are visually impaired or learning disabled.




Image Size - Width and Height
You can use the style attribute to specify the width and 
height of an image.

Example

<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" style="width:500px;height:600px;">

Try it Yourself »

Alternatively, you can use the width and height attributes:

Example

<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" width="500" height="600">

Try it Yourself »

The width and height attributes always define the width and height of the 
image in pixels.

Note: Always specify the width and height of an image. If width and height are not specified, the 
  web page 
  might flicker while the image loads.




Width and Height, or Style?
The width, height, and style attributes are 
all valid in HTML.
However, we suggest using the style attribute. It prevents styles sheets from changing 
the size of images:

Example

 <!DOCTYPE html><html><head><style>img {   width: 100%; }
 </style></head><body><img src="html5.gif" alt="HTML5 Icon" width="128" height="128"><img src="html5.gif" alt="HTML5 Icon" style="width:128px;height:128px;"></body></html>
Try it Yourself »




Images in Another Folder
If you have your images in a sub-folder, you must include the folder 
name in the src attribute:

Example

<img src="/images/html5.gif" 
alt="HTML5 Icon" style="width:128px;height:128px;">

Images on Another Server/Website
Some web sites point to an image on another server.
To point to an image on another server, you must specify an absolute (full) 
URL in the src attribute:

Example

<img src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/w3schools_green.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com">

be removed or changed.

tag:

Image Floating
Use the CSS float property to let the image float to the right or to the left of a text:

Example

<p><img src="smiley.gif" alt="Smiley face"
style="float:right;width:42px;height:42px;">
 The image will float to the right of 
the text.</p><p><img src="smiley.gif" alt="Smiley face"
style="float:left;width:42px;height:42px;">
 The image will float to the left of 
the text.</p>
