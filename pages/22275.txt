HTML Server-Sent Events API

❮ Previous
Next ❯


The Server-Sent Events (SSE) API enables pushing 
messages/updates from a server to the web page via HTTP connection.

Server-Sent Events - One Way Messaging
A server-sent event is when a web page automatically gets messages/updates from a server.
Normally, a web page has to request data from the server, but with server-sent events, the updates 
are pushed automatically.
Examples: Facebook/Twitter updates, stock market updates, news feeds, sport results, etc.

Browser Support
The numbers in the table specify the first browser version that fully support 
the Server-Sent Events API.

Receive Server-Sent Event Notifications
The EventSource object is used to receive server-sent event notifications:

Example

  <script>const x = document.getElementById("result");
  // Check browser support for SSEif(typeof(EventSource) 
  !== "undefined") {  var source = new EventSource("demo_sse.php");  
  source.onmessage = function(event) {    x.innerHTML += 
  event.data + "<br>";  };} else {  x.innerHTML = "Sorry, 
  no support for server-sent events.";}</script>
Try it Yourself »

Example explained:

Create a new EventSource object, and specify the URL of the page sending the updates (in this example "demo_sse.php")
Each time an update is received, the onmessage event occurs
When an onmessage event occurs, put the received data into the element with id="result"


Check Browser Support
In the tryit example above there were some extra lines of code to check browser support for server-sent events:

if(typeof(EventSource) !== "undefined") {
    // Yes! Server-sent events support!
    // Some code.....
 }
 else {
    // Sorry! No server-sent events support..
 }








Server-Side Code Example
For the example above to work, you need a server capable of sending data updates (like PHP or ASP).
The server-side event stream syntax is simple. Set the "Content-Type" header to 
"text/event-stream". Now you can start sending event streams.
Code in PHP (demo_sse.php):

 <?phpheader('Content-Type: text/event-stream');
 header('Cache-Control: no-cache');$time = date('r');echo "data: The server time is: {$time}\n\n";flush();?>

Code in ASP (VB) (demo_sse.asp):

 <%Response.ContentType = "text/event-stream"Response.Expires = -1
 Response.Write("data: The server time is: " & now())Response.Flush()%>

Code explained:

Set the "Content-Type" header to 
"text/event-stream"
Specify that the page should not cache
Output the data to send (Always start with "data: ")
Flush the output data back to the web page


The EventSource Object
In the examples above we used the onmessage event to get messages. But other events are also available:


Events
Description


onopen
When a connection to the server is opened


onmessage
When a message is received


onerror
When an error occurs
