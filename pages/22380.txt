Tips for Students

Read Instructions Carefully

Understand what the task requires before you start coding.
Think before you code.


Use Examples

Look at the sample code if provided.
Change small parts to see different outcomes.


Practice Often

Regular coding helps you build confidence and skill.


Debug and Experiment

If errors appear, read the messages carefully.
Adjust your code and test again.





Examples of Programming Assignments
There are many different approaches to set up your assignments.
It depends on the programming language you are using and which topics you want to cover.
You can find inspiration in our pre-built library or on the internet.
Here are some examples:
HTML Basics

Create a webpage with a heading, paragraph, and image.
Use correct HTML tags and attributes.
Add a link to another webpage.

JavaScript Loops

Write a loop that counts from 1 to 10.
Print each number to the console.
Explore different loop types (for, while, do...while).

Python Calculator

Build a simple calculator with functions.
Include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Handle user input and display the result.


Tip: Wherever possible, connect your assignments to real-life scenarios (e.g., building a small weather app, processing restaurant orders). This can spark students’ interest and help them see the practical value of coding.
Consider pair programming or group activities. Students often learn faster when they brainstorm and troubleshoot together.
After each assignment, have stduents reflect and discuss what they learned, what challenges they faced, and how they overcame them. This approach helps solidify new skills.
Give extra tasks that go beyond the requirements. This keeps the more advanced learners engaged and provides learning opportunities for everyone.


Advanced Topics
These topics are best for learners who are comfortable with the basics.
Database Integration

Create tasks that connect to a small database.
Practice SQL queries and data management.

API Projects

Work with APIs and handle data in JSON format.
Learn how to make requests and parse responses.

User Authentication

Build a simple login system.
Learn how sessions or tokens work.


Tools for Teachers
Pre-Built Assignments
Many platforms, such as Academy, offer ready-made tasks.
Save time on lesson planning.
Custom Assignments
Create your own tasks for specific lessons.
Tailor them to meet your classroom needs.
Progress Tracking
Check detailed reports on student submissions.
Identify common mistakes and help students improve.

Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them
Forgetting Semicolons or Brackets
Check your syntax carefully in languages that require them.
Using the Wrong Data Type
Make sure you use the correct data type (string, integer, float, etc.).
Not Testing Code Often
Run your code in small steps.
This makes it easier to fix errors early.
