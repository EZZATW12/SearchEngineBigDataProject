HTML Input form* Attributes

❮ Previous
Next ❯


This chapter describes the different form* attributes for the HTML <input> element. 


The form Attribute
The input form attribute specifies the form 
the <input> element belongs to.
The value of this attribute must be equal to the id attribute of the <form> 
element it belongs to.

Example
An input field located outside of the HTML form (but still a part of the form):

  
    <form action="/action_page.php" id="form1">  <label for="fname">First 
    name:</label>  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname"><br><br>  
    <input type="submit" value="Submit"></form><label for="lname">Last 
    name:</label><input type="text" id="lname" 
    name="lname" form="form1">

The formaction Attribute
The input formaction attribute specifies the URL of 
the file that will process the input when the form is submitted.
Note: This attribute overrides the 
action attribute of the <form> element.
The formaction attribute works with the 
following input types: submit and image.

Example
An HTML form with two submit buttons, with different actions:

  
    <form action="/action_page.php">  <label for="fname">First 
    name:</label>  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname"><br><br>  
    <label for="lname">Last name:</label>  <input type="text" id="lname" 
    name="lname"><br><br>  <input type="submit" value="Submit">  
    <input type="submit" formaction="/action_page2.php" value="Submit as Admin">
    </form>

The formenctype Attribute
The input formenctype  attribute specifies how the form-data should be encoded when submitted (only for forms with method="post").
Note: This attribute overrides the enctype attribute of the <form> element.
The formenctype attribute works with the 
following input types: submit and image.

Example
A form with two submit buttons. The first sends the form-data with default encoding, 
the second sends the form-data encoded as "multipart/form-data":

  
    <form action="/action_page_binary.asp" method="post">  <label for="fname">First 
    name:</label>  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname"><br><br>  
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">  <input type="submit" 
    formenctype="multipart/form-data"  value="Submit as 
    Multipart/form-data"></form>

The formmethod Attribute
The input formmethod  attribute defines the HTTP method for sending form-data to the action URL.
Note: This attribute overrides the method  attribute of the <form> element.
The formmethod attribute works with the 
following input types: submit and image.
The form-data can be sent as URL variables (method="get") or as an HTTP post 
transaction (method="post").
Notes on the "get" method:

This method appends the form-data to the URL in name/value pairs
This method is useful for form submissions where a user want to bookmark 
  the result
There is a limit to how much data you can place in a URL (varies between 
  browsers), therefore, you cannot be sure that all of the form-data will be 
  correctly transferred
Never use the "get" method to pass sensitive information! (password or 
  other sensitive information will be visible in the browser's address bar)

Notes on the "post" method:

This method sends the form-data as an HTTP post transaction
Form submissions with the "post" method cannot be bookmarked
The "post" method is more robust and secure than "get", and "post" does 
  not have size limitations


Example
A form with two submit buttons. The first sends the form-data with 
method="get". The second sends the form-data with method="post":

    <form action="/action_page.php" method="get">  <label for="fname">First 
    name:</label>  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname"><br><br>  
    <label for="lname">Last name:</label>  <input type="text" id="lname" 
    name="lname"><br><br>  <input type="submit" value="Submit using 
    GET">  <input type="submit" formmethod="post" value="Submit using 
    POST"></form>

The formtarget Attribute
The input formtarget attribute specifies a name or a keyword that indicates where 
to display the response that is received after submitting the form.
Note: This attribute overrides the target attribute of the <form> element.

following input types: submit and image.

Example
A form with two submit buttons, with different target windows:

    <form action="/action_page.php">  <label for="fname">First 
    name:</label>  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname"><br><br>  
    <label for="lname">Last name:</label>  <input type="text" id="lname" 
    name="lname"><br><br>  <input type="submit" value="Submit">  
    <input type="submit" formtarget="_blank" value="Submit to a new window/tab">
    </form>

that an <input> element should not be validated when submitted.

Example
A form with two submit buttons (with and without validation):

    <form action="/action_page.php">  <label for="email">Enter your 
    email:</label>  <input type="email" id="email" name="email"><br><br>
