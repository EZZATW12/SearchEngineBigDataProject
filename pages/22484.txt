CSS Masking

❮ Previous
Next ❯


With CSS masking you create a mask layer to place over an 
element to partially or fully hide portions of the element.

The CSS mask-image Property
The CSS mask-image property specifies a mask 
layer 
image.
The mask layer image can be a PNG image, an SVG image, a CSS gradient, or an 
SVG <mask> element. 

Browser Support
The numbers in the table below specify the first browser version that fully supports the property.
Numbers followed by -webkit- specify the first version that worked with a prefix.



Property







mask-image
120
120
53
15.4
15 -webkit-




Use an Image as the Mask Layer
To use a PNG or an SVG image as the mask layer, use a url() value to pass in the mask 
layer image.
The mask image needs to have a transparent or semi-transparent area. Black 
indicates fully transparent.
Here is the mask image (a PNG image) we will use:

Here is an image from Cinque Terre, in Italy:

Now, we apply the mask image (the PNG image above) as the mask layer for the image from Cinque 
Terre, Italy:




Example
Here is the source code:

  .mask1 {  -webkit-mask-image: url(w3logo.png);  mask-image: 
  url(w3logo.png);  mask-repeat: no-repeat; }
Try it Yourself »

Example Explained
The mask-image property specifies the image 
to be used as a mask layer for an element.
The mask-repeat property specifies if or how 
a mask image will be repeated. The no-repeat 
value indicates that the mask image will not be repeated (the mask image will 
only be shown once).
Another Example
If we omit the mask-repeat property, the mask image will be repeated all over the
image from Cinque Terre, Italy:




Example
Here is the source code:

  .mask1 {  -webkit-mask-image: url(w3logo.png);  mask-image: 
  url(w3logo.png);}

Use Gradients as the Mask Layer
CSS linear and radial gradients can also be used as mask images.
Linear Gradient Examples
Here, we use a linear-gradient as the mask layer for our image. This linear 
gradient goes from top (black) to bottom (transparent):

 

Example
Use a linear gradient as a mask layer:

    .mask1 {  -webkit-mask-image: linear-gradient(black, transparent);  mask-image: linear-gradient(black, 
    transparent);}

Here, we use a linear-gradient along with text masking as the mask layer for 
our image:

The Cinque Terre is a coastal area within Liguria, in the northwest of Italy. It lies in the west of La Spezia Province, and comprises five villages: Monterosso al Mare, Vernazza, Corniglia, Manarola, and Riomaggiore.

Radial Gradient Examples
Here, we use a radial-gradient (shaped as a circle) as the mask layer for our image:




Example
Use a radial gradient as a mask layer (a circle):

    .mask2 {  -webkit-mask-image: 
    radial-gradient(circle, black 50%, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5) 50%);  
    mask-image: radial-gradient(circle, black 50%, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5) 50%);}

Here, we use a radial-gradient (shaped as an ellipse) as the mask layer for 
our image:




Example
Use another radial gradient as a mask layer (an ellipse):

    .mask3 {  -webkit-mask-image: radial-gradient(ellipse, black 50%, rgba(0, 
    0, 0, 0.5) 50%);  mask-image: radial-gradient(ellipse, black 50%, rgba(0, 0, 
    0, 0.5) 50%);}

Use SVG as the Mask Layer
The SVG <mask> element can be used inside an 
SVG graphic to create masking effects.
Here, we use the SVG <mask> element to create different mask layers for 
our image:





  Sorry, your browser does not support inline SVG.


Example
An SVG mask layer (formed as a triangle):

    <svg width="600" height="400">  <mask id="svgmask1">    
    <polygon fill="#ffffff" points="200 0, 400 400, 0 400"></polygon>  
    </mask>  <image xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" 
    xlink:href="img_5terre.jpg" mask="url(#svgmask1)"></image></svg>
