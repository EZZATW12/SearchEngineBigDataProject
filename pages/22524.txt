Sass Color Functions

❮ Previous
Next ❯


Sass Color Functions
We have divided the color functions in Sass into three parts: Set color 
functions, Get color functions, and Manipulate color functions:
Sass Set Color Functions



Function
Description & Example


rgb(red, green, blue)
Sets a color using the Red-Green-Blue (RGB) model. An RGB color value is 
    specified with: rgb(red, green, blue). Each parameter defines the intensity 
    of that color and can be an integer between 0 and 255, or a percentage value 
    (from 0% to 100%).
Example:rgb(0, 0, 255); // rendered as blue because the 
    blue parameter is set to its highest value (255) and the others are set to 0


rgba(red, green, blue, alpha)
Sets a color using the Red-Green-Blue-Alpha (RGBA) model. RGBA color 
    values are an extension of RGB color values with an alpha channel - which 
    specifies the opacity of the color. The alpha parameter is a number between 
    0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (fully opaque).
Example:rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3); // rendered as blue with 
    opacity


hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)
Sets a color using the Hue-Saturation-Lightness (HSL) model - and 
    represents a cylindrical-coordinate representation of colors. Hue is a 
    degree on the color wheel (from 0 to 360) - 0 or 360 is red, 120 is green, 
    240 is blue. Saturation is a percentage value; 0% means a shade of gray and 
    100% is the full color. Lightness is also a percentage; 0% is black, 100% is 
    white.
Example:hsl(120, 100%, 50%); // greenhsl(120, 100%, 
    75%); // light greenhsl(120, 100%, 25%); // dark greenhsl(120, 60%, 
    70%); // pastel green 


hsla(hue, saturation, lightness, alpha)
Sets a color using the Hue-Saturation-Lightness-Alpha (HSLA) model. HSLA 
    color values are an extension of HSL color values with an alpha channel - 
    which specifies the opacity of the color. The alpha parameter is a number 
    between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (fully opaque).
Example:hsl(120, 100%, 50%, 0.3); // green with opacity
    hsl(120, 100%, 75%, 0.3); // light green with opacity


grayscale(color)
Sets a gray color with the same lightness as color.
Example:grayscale(#7fffd4);Result: #c6c6c6


complement(color)
Sets a color that is the complementary color of color.
Example:complement(#7fffd4);Result: #ff7faa


invert(color, weight)
Sets a color that is the inverse or negative color of color. 
    The weight parameter is optional and must be a number between 0% 
    and 100%. Default is 100%.
Example:invert(white);Result: black



Sass Get Color Functions



Function
Description & Example


red(color)
Returns the red value of color as a number between 0 and 255.
Example:red(#7fffd4);Result: 127red(red);Result: 
    255


green(color)
Returns the green value of color as a number between 0 and 255.
Example:green(#7fffd4);Result: 255green(blue);Result: 
    0


blue(color)
Returns the blue value of color as a number between 0 and 255.
Example:blue(#7fffd4);Result: 212blue(blue);Result: 255


hue(color)
Returns the hue of color as a number between 0deg and 360deg.
Example:hue(#7fffd4);Result: 160deg


saturation(color)
Returns the HSL saturation of color as a number between 0% and 
    100%.
Example:saturation(#7fffd4);Result: 100%


lightness(color)
Returns the HSL lightness of color as a number between 0% and 
    100%.
Example:lightness(#7fffd4);Result: 74.9%


alpha(color)
Returns the alpha channel of color as a number between 0 and 1.
Example:alpha(#7fffd4);Result: 1


opacity(color)
Returns the alpha channel of color as a number between 0 and 1.
Example:opacity(rgba(127, 255, 212, 0.5));Result: 
    0.5



Sass Manipulate Color Functions



Function
Description & Example


mix(color1, color2, weight)
Creates a color that is a mix of color1 and color2. 
    The weight parameter must be between 0% and 100%. A larger weight 
    means that more of color1 should be used. A smaller weight means that more
