"We chose W3Schools Academy because of its proven ability
            to
            deliver high-quality education. With clear, concise, and interactive tutorials, W3Schools makes learning

Co-Founder
Boolean Girl


"Boolean Girl was looking for a single platform to teach
            Python
            and Web development to students. We already used W3Schools as a reference platform in our teaching so it
            made sense to also use the development environment."








Gavin Taylor
Head of Adult Education
LearnTech


"W3Schools classroom solution allows students to complete
            the
            courses, and our tutors to monitor progress, set goals and provide support where needed. We recommend this
            classroom tool with W3Schools courses."
