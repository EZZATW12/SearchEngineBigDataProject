Rounded Image:

        img {  border-radius: 8px;}
      
Try it Yourself »





Example
Circled Image:

        img {  border-radius: 50%;}
      
Try it Yourself »



Also look at the CSS Image Shapes chapter 
to learn how to shape (clip) images to circles, ellipses and polygons.

Thumbnail Images
Use the border property to create thumbnail images.



Thumbnail Image:


Example

        img {  border: 1px solid #ddd;  border-radius: 4px;  padding: 5px;  width: 150px;}
        <img src="paris.jpg"
        alt="Paris">
      
Try it Yourself »



Thumbnail Image as Link:




Example

        img {  border: 1px solid #ddd;  border-radius: 4px;  padding: 5px;  width: 150px;}img:hover {
           box-shadow: 0 0 
         2px 1px rgba(0, 140, 186, 0.5);}
         <a href="paris.jpg">  <img src="paris.jpg" alt="Paris"></a>
      
Try it Yourself »









Responsive Images
Responsive images will automatically adjust to fit the size of the screen.
Resize the browser window to see the effect:

If you want an image to scale down if it has to, but never 
scale up to be larger than its original size, add the following:

Example

img {  max-width: 100%;  height: 
auto;}
Try it Yourself »

Tip: Read more about Responsive Web Design in our CSS RWD Tutorial.

Image Modal (Advanced)
This is an example to demonstrate how CSS and JavaScript can work together.
First, use CSS to create a modal window (dialog box), and hide it by 
default.
Then, use a JavaScript to show the modal window and to display the  
image inside the modal, when a user clicks on the image:




Example

// Get the modalvar modal = document.getElementById('myModal');// Get the image and insert it 
inside the modal - use its "alt" text as a captionvar img = 
document.getElementById('myImg');var modalImg = document.getElementById("img01");
var captionText = document.getElementById("caption");img.onclick = 
function(){  modal.style.display = "block";  modalImg.src = this.src;  captionText.innerHTML = this.alt;}
// Get the <span> element that closes the modalvar span = 
document.getElementsByClassName("close")[0];// When the user clicks 
on <span> (x), close the modalspan.onclick = function() {   modal.style.display = "none";}
