As the distributor, W3Schools handles purchasing and billing. If you have any complaints, claims, or concerns about these third-party products, please contact us at support@w3schools.com.
The mutual agreement for a domain renews automatically each year. If you don't want to continue with a domain purchase from us, you must cancel the renewal before the end of the current agreement. See the Billing and Account Information section for more billing information.
We are not liable for any harm, errors, or omissions caused by the domain registry administrator's actions, including domain registration or renewal requests. Before purchasing a domain, please review all associated third-party policies and practices to ensure you understand their terms.

Billing and Account Information
We reserve the right to refuse any order placed with us. At our sole discretion, we can limit or cancel the quantities purchased by any individual, household, or for any specific order. These restrictions also apply to orders made under the same customer account, using the same payment method, or associated with the same billing or shipping address.
If we need to change or cancel an order, we will email you using the email address you provided at the time of purchase.
Please know that you agree to provide current, complete, and accurate purchase and account information for all orders made through our website. You must keep your account details updated at all times, including your email address and payment method, so we can process your transactions and contact you if needed.

Optional Tools and Third-Party Links
We sometimes provide access to third-party tools we do not develop, monitor, or control. These tools are offered "as is" and "as available," without warranties, endorsements, or promises. We are not responsible for any issues or damages that arise from your use of these optional third-party tools.
If you choose to use these tools, you do so at your own risk. Before you proceed with any such tools, please ensure you understand and agree to the terms set by the third-party provider.
The Website may include links to external websites or services we do not operate or control. While we try to avoid linking to harmful or offensive content, we cannot guarantee the accuracy or quality of third-party materials, products, or services. We are not liable for any harm or damages you experience with third-party websites or services.
Before you engage in any transaction with a third party, review their policies and practices to ensure you are comfortable with them. If you have complaints, claims, concerns, or questions about third-party products or services, please direct them to the appropriate third party.
