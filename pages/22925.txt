CSS Comments

❮ Previous
Next ❯


CSS comments are not displayed in the browser, but they can 
help document your source code.

CSS Comments
Comments are used to explain the code, and may help when you edit the source code at a later date.
Comments are ignored by browsers.
A CSS comment is placed inside the <style> element, and starts with /* and ends with */:

Example

  /* This is a single-line comment */p
{
   
color: red;
}
Try it Yourself »

You can add comments wherever you want in the code:

Example

    p
{
   
color: red; 
  /* Set text color to red */
}
Try it Yourself »

Even in the middle of a code line:

Example

    p
{
   
color: /*red*/blue; 
}
Try it Yourself »

Comments can also span 
multiple lines: 

Example

  /* This isa multi-linecomment */
p
{
   
color: red;
}

Try it Yourself »







HTML and CSS Comments
From the HTML tutorial, you learned that you can add comments to your HTML source by using the 
<!--...--> syntax.
In the following example, we use a combination of HTML and CSS comments:

Example

  <!DOCTYPE html><html><head><style>p {  color: red; /* Set 
  text color to red */} </style></head><body><h2>My 
  Heading</h2><!-- These paragraphs will be red --><p>Hello 
  World!</p><p>This paragraph is styled with CSS.</p><p>HTML 
  and CSS comments are 
  not shown in the output.</p></body></html>
