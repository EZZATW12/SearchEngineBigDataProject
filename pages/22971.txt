Responsive Web Design - Media Queries

❮ Previous
Next ❯


What is a Media Query?
Media query is a CSS technique introduced in CSS3.
It uses the @media rule to include a block of CSS properties only if a 
certain condition is true.

Example
If the browser window is 600px or smaller, the background color will be lightblue:

@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {  body {
   
background-color: lightblue;  }}
Try it Yourself »


Add a Breakpoint
Earlier in this tutorial we made a web page with rows and columns, and it 
was responsive, but it did not look good on a small screen.
Media queries can help with that. We can add a breakpoint where 
certain parts of the design will behave differently on each side of the 
breakpoint.




    Desktop
  



    Phone
  



Example
Here we use a media query to add a breakpoint at 600px:

  @media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {  .item1 {grid-area: 1 / 
  span 6;}  .item2 {grid-area: 2 / span 6;}  .item3 
  {grid-area: 3 / span 6;}  .item4 {grid-area: 4 / span 6;}  
  .item5 {grid-area: 5 / span 6;}}
Try it Yourself »







Another Breakpoint
You can add as many breakpoints as you like.
We will also insert a breakpoint between tablets and mobile phones.




    Desktop
  



    Tablet
  



    Phone
  



Example
Here we use media queries to add breakpoints when screen is max 600px, when 
screen is min 600px, and when screen is min 768px :

  @media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {  .item1 {grid-area: 1 / 
  span 6;}  .item2 {grid-area: 2 / span 6;}  .item3 
  {grid-area: 3 / span 6;}  .item4 {grid-area: 4 / span 6;}  
  .item5 {grid-area: 5 / span 6;}}@media 
  only screen and (min-width: 600px) {  .item1 {grid-area: 1 / span 6;}  
  .item2 {grid-area: 2 / span 1;}  .item3 {grid-area: 2 / span 4;}

Typical Device Breakpoints
There are tons of screens and devices with different heights and widths, so it is hard to create an exact breakpoint for each device. To keep things simple you could target 
five groups:

Example

  /* 
  Extra small devices (phones, 600px and down) */@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) 
  {...} /* Small devices (portrait tablets and large phones, 600px and up) 
  */@media only screen and (min-width: 600px) {...} /* Medium devices (landscape tablets, 768px and up) */
  @media only screen and (min-width: 768px) {...} /* Large devices (laptops/desktops, 992px and up) 
  */
  @media only screen and (min-width: 992px) {...} /* Extra large devices (large 
  laptops and desktops, 
  1200px and up) */@media only screen and (min-width: 1200px) {...}

Orientation: Portrait / Landscape
Media queries can also be used to change layout of a page depending on the 
orientation of the browser.
You can have a set of CSS properties that will only 
apply when the browser window is wider than its height, a so called "Landscape" 
orientation: 

Example
The web page will have a lightblue background if the orientation is in landscape mode:

@media only screen and (orientation: 
landscape) {  body {
     
background-color: lightblue;  }}

Hide Elements With Media Queries
Another common use of media queries, is to hide elements on different screen sizes:
I will be hidden on small screens.

Example

  /* If the screen size is 600px wide or less, hide the element */@media 
  only screen and (max-width: 600px) {  div.example {    
  display: none;  }}

Change Font Size With Media Queries
You can also use media queries to change the font size of an element on 
different screen sizes:
Variable Font Size.

Example

  /* If the screen size is 601px or 
  more, set the font-size of <div> to 80px */@media only screen and (min-width: 
  601px) {  div.example {    
  font-size: 80px;  }}/* If the screen size is 600px or 
  less, 
  set the font-size of <div> to 30px */@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {  div.example {    
  font-size: 30px;  }}
