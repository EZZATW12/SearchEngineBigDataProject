Learning by Examples
Our "Show React" tool makes it easy to demonstrate React. It shows both the code and the result.

Example:
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

function Hello(props) {
  return <h1>Hello World!</h1>;
}

const container = document.getElementById("root");
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(container);
root.render(<Hello />);

Create React App
To learn and test React, you should set up a React Environment on 
your computer.
This tutorial uses the create-react-app.
The create-react-app tool is an officially supported way to create React applications.
Node.js is required to use create-react-app.
Open your terminal in the directory you would like to create your 
application.
Run this command to create a React application named
my-react-app:


  npx create-react-app my-react-app


create-react-app will set up everything you need to run a React application.

Note:
If you've previously installed create-react-app globally,
it is recommended that you uninstall the package to ensure npx always uses the latest version of
create-react-app.
To uninstall, run this command: npm uninstall -g create-react-app.



Run the React Application
Run this command to move to the my-react-app directory:


  cd my-react-app


Run this command to execute the React application 
my-react-app:


  npm start


A new browser window will pop up with your newly created React App! If not, open your browser and type 
localhost:3000 in the address bar.
The result:





You will learn more about the create-react-app in the React Get Started chapter.


What You Should Already Know
Before you continue you should have a basic understanding of the following:

HTML
CSS
JavaScript

If you want to study these subjects first, find the tutorials on our
Home page.
In addition, you should also have some experience with the new JavaScript features 
introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6), you will learn about them in the React ES6 chapter.
