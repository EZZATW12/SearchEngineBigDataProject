AppML Models

Example

{"security": "admin",
 "rowsperpage" : 10,
"database": {    "connection": "mysql",    
"sql"       : "SELECT * FROM Customers",    
"orderby"   : "CustomerName"}},"filteritems" : [
    {"item" : "CustomerName", "label" : "Customer"},
    {"item" : "City"},
    {"item" : "Country"}], "sortitems" : [
    {"item" : "CustomerName", "label" : "Customer"},
    {"item" : "City"},
    {"item" : "Country"}]}



AppML Model Properties


Element
Description


"data"
Defines a flat file source for the model


"database"
Defines a database source for the model


"filteritems"
Defines filter restrictions


"rowsperpage"
Defines number of rows to be fetched per page


"security"
Defines the security for the model


"sortitems"
Defines sorting restrictions



Application Security
You have to be logged in as a member of the "admin" group, to access this 
application:

Example

{"security": "admin",
"database": {    "connection": "mysql",    
"sql"       : "SELECT * FROM Customers",    
"orderby"   : "CustomerName"}}



Private Models
You can add your own private data to the model.
This example suggests restrictions to data:

Example

    "restrictions" : {   
    "fname" : {"maxlength": 40},   
    "price" : {"max": 999,"min": 100}    }


Model data can be used by server applications, and by your AppML controller.
This example uses model data to validate input:

Example

    function myController($appml) {   
    if ($appml.message == "submit") {        var price = document.getElementById("price").value;        if (price < $appml.model.restrictions.price.min) {            $appml.displayError(15, "Price 
    too low!");            return;        }
    }
