Get Started

Sandbox and Lab Environment
CSS, like any other coding language, is best learned by working hands-on with code.
Easily try code with our "Try it Yourself" editor.
Here, you can edit CSS code and view the result:

CSS Example

body
{  background-color: lightblue;}
h1
{
  color: white;
  text-align: center;
}
p
{
   
font-family: verdana;
  font-size: 20px;
}
Try it Yourself »
If you want to explore more and host your project, we have a feature called Spaces 
that allows you to build, test and deploy static websites for free.
Here you get a secure sandbox environment called Spaces, where you can practice coding and test projects in real-time.
Spaces allow you to test, build, and deploy code. This includes a W3Schools subdomain, hosting, and secure SSL certificates.
Spaces require no installation and run directly in the browser.
Features include:

Collaboration
File navigator
Terminal & log
Package manager
Database
Environment manager
Analytics

CSS Certification
W3Schools offers an end-of-pathway certification program.
Here you can take exams to get certified.
The CSS exam is a test that summarizes the W3Schools CSS syllabus.
After passing the exam you get the "Certified CSS Developer" Certification.
There are two different types of certifications:

Non-adaptive
Adaptive

The non-adaptive is pass or no pass.
The adaptive certification is adaptive and graded; students will get a grade from intermediate, advanced to professional.
