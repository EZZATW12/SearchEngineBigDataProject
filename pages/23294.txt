HTML id Attribute

❮ Previous
Next ❯


The HTML id attribute is used 
to specify a unique id for an HTML element.
You cannot have more than one element with the same id in an 
HTML document.


The id Attribute
The id attribute specifies a unique id 
for an HTML element. The value of the id 
attribute must be unique within the HTML document.
The id attribute is used to point 
to a specific style declaration in a style sheet. It is also used by JavaScript to access and 
manipulate the element with the specific id.
The syntax for id is: write a hash character (#), followed by an id name. 
Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}.
In the following example we have an <h1> element that points to the 
id name 
"myHeader". This <h1> 
element will be styled according to the #myHeader 
style definition in the head section:

Example

  <!DOCTYPE html><html><head><style>#myHeader {  
  background-color: lightblue;  color: black;  padding: 40px;  
  text-align: center;} </style></head><body><h1 id="myHeader">My 
  Header</h1></body></html>

Note: The id name is case sensitive!
Note: The id name must contain at least one 
  character, cannot start with a number, and must not contain whitespaces (spaces, tabs, 
  etc.).




Difference Between Class and ID
A 
class name can be used by multiple HTML elements, while an id name must only be 
used by one HTML element 
within the page:

Example

  <style>/* Style the element with the id "myHeader" 
  */
#myHeader {  background-color: lightblue;  
  color: black;  padding: 
  40px;  text-align: center;}/* Style all 
  elements with the class name "city" */.city
  {  background-color: tomato;  color: white;  padding: 10px;} </style>
<!-- An element with a unique id --><h1 id="myHeader">My 
  Cities</h1><!-- Multiple elements with same class --><h2 class="city">London</h2><p>London is the capital of England.</p>
  <h2 class="city">Paris</h2><p>Paris is the capital of France.</p>
  <h2 class="city">Tokyo</h2><p>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.</p>

Tip: You can learn much more about CSS in our CSS Tutorial.









HTML Bookmarks with ID and Links
HTML bookmarks are used to allow readers to jump to specific parts of a webpage.
Bookmarks can be useful if your page is very long.
To use a bookmark, you must first create it, and then add a link 
to it.
Then, when the link is clicked, the page will scroll to the location with the 
bookmark.
Example
First, create a bookmark with the id attribute:


<h2 id="C4">Chapter 4</h2>

Then, add a link to the bookmark ("Jump to Chapter 4"), from within the same page:

Example

 <a href="#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a>

Try it Yourself »

Or, add a link to the bookmark ("Jump to Chapter 4"), from another page:


<a href="html_demo.html#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a>





Using the id Attribute in JavaScript
The id attribute can also be used by JavaScript to perform 
some tasks for that specific element.
JavaScript can access an element with a specific id with the getElementById() method:

Example
Use the id attribute to manipulate text with JavaScript:

  <script>function displayResult() {  document.getElementById("myHeader").innerHTML = "Have a nice day!";}
  </script>

Tip: Study JavaScript in the HTML JavaScript chapter, or in our
JavaScript Tutorial.
