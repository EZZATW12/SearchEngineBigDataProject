CSS Units

❮ Previous
Next ❯


CSS Units
CSS has several different units for expressing a length.
Many CSS properties take "length" values, such as width, margin, padding, 
font-size, etc.
Length is a number followed by a length unit, such as 10px, 
2em, etc.

Example
Set different length values, using px (pixels):

  h1 {  font-size: 60px;}p {  font-size: 25px;  
  line-height: 50px;}
Try it Yourself »

Note: A whitespace cannot appear between the number and the unit. However, if the value is 
0, the unit can be omitted.
For some CSS properties, negative lengths are allowed.
There are two types of length units: absolute and relative.

Absolute Lengths
The absolute length units are fixed and a length expressed in any of these will appear as exactly that size.
Absolute length units are not recommended for use on screen, because screen sizes vary so much. 
However, they can be used if the output medium is known, such 
as for print layout.



Unit
Description


cm
centimeters
    Try it



mm
millimeters
    Try it



in
inches (1in = 96px = 2.54cm)
    Try it



px *
pixels (1px = 1/96th of 1in)
    Try it



pt
points (1pt = 1/72 of 1in)
    Try it



pc
picas (1pc = 12 pt)
    Try it




* Pixels (px) are relative to the viewing device. For low-dpi devices, 1px is one device pixel (dot) of the display. For printers and high resolution 
screens 1px implies multiple device pixels.

Relative Lengths
Relative length units specify a length relative to another length property. 
Relative length units scale better between different rendering mediums.



Unit
Description



em
Relative to the font-size of the element (2em means 2 times the size of the current font)
Try it


ex
Relative to the x-height of the current font (rarely used)
Try it


ch
Relative to width of the "0" (zero)
Try it


rem
Relative to font-size of the root element
Try it


vw
Relative to 1% of the width of the viewport*
Try it


vh

Try it


vmin

Try it


vmax
Relative to 1% of viewport's* larger dimension
