CSS Layout - The display Property

❮ Previous
Next ❯


The display property is the most important CSS property for controlling layout.

The display Property
The display property is used to specify how an element is shown on a web page.
Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is. The default display value for most elements is block or 
inline.
The display property is used to change the default display behavior of HTML elements. 

Block-level Elements
A block-level element ALWAYS starts on a new line and takes up the full width available 
(stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

The <div> element is a block-level element.
Examples of block-level elements:

<div>
<h1> - <h6>
<p>
<form>
<header>
<footer>
<section>


Inline Elements
An inline element DOES NOT start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.
This is an inline <span> element 
inside a paragraph.
Examples of inline elements:

<span>
<a>
<img>







The display Property Values

Display: none;
display: none; is commonly used with JavaScript to hide 
and show elements without deleting and recreating them. Take a look at our last 
example on this page if you want to know how this can be achieved.
The <script> element uses display: none; 
as default.
Click to show panel

This panel contains a <div> element, which is hidden by default (display: none;).
It is styled with CSS, and we use JavaScript to show it (change it to (display: block;).


Override The Default Display Value
As mentioned, every element has a default display value. However, you can 
override this.
Changing an inline element to a block element, or vice versa, can be useful for 
making the page look a specific way, and still follow the web standards.
A common example is making inline <li> elements for horizontal menus:

Example

li {  display: inline;}

Note: Setting the display property of an element only changes how the element is displayed, 
NOT what kind of element it is. So, an inline element with display: block; is not allowed
to have other block elements inside it.

The following example displays <span> elements as block elements:

Example

span {  display: block;}
Try it Yourself »

The following example displays <a> elements as block elements:

Example

a {  display: block;}
Try it Yourself »


Hide an Element - display:none or visibility:hidden?


display:none

Remove

visibility:hidden

Hide

Reset

Reset All




Hiding an element can be done by setting the display property to 
none. 
The element will be hidden, and the page will be displayed as if the element is not 
there:

Example

h1.hidden {  display: none;}
Try it Yourself »

visibility:hidden; also hides an element.
However, the element will still take up the same space 
as before. The element will be hidden, but still affect the layout:

Example

h1.hidden {  visibility: hidden;}
Try it Yourself »
