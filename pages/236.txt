"But I think that that is one of the huge legacies that he leaves behind."We had him when he visited Ireland back in 2018, I never got a chance to meet him at that time, but to be here today is just so special on so many levels and just a huge privilege from me to represent all those people at home."We have a huge Catholic population but Pope Francis reached well beyond the Catholic population, he reached out to so many. The marginalised, the poor, the vulnerable, our LGBT communities."She called Pope Francis "a man of humility, a man who practised what he preached and was very much on the side of the marginalised and of the poor, who spoke up against injustice wherever he saw it".LIVE UPDATES: The funeral of Pope FrancisGUIDE: The funeral of Pope FrancisEXPLAINER: How the next Pope is chosenEPA-EFE/REX/ShutterstockPope Francis died at the age of 88 on Easter MondayThe late pontiff's funeral took place at 09:00 BST (10:00 local time) in the Vatican on Saturday.During the funeral Pope Francis' simple coffin, which was made of wood and zinc, was laid in the square in front of St Peter's Basilica.Dozens of leaders and dignitaries - including Donald Trump, Volodymyr Zelensky, and Prince William - joined an estimated 250,000 mourners, with 50,000 inside St Peter's Square itself.EPA-EFE/REX/ShutterstockCardinal Kevin Farrell (far left) presiding over the entombment of the late Pope Francis in the Santa Maria Maggiore basilica in RomeAfter the service, the body of Pope Francis - dressed in a red chasuble and a damask and golden papal mitre - was taken from St Peter's to the Santa Maria Maggiore basilica in Rome for burial.In the final moment of the funeral of Pope Francis, the Vatican's camerlengo, Irish-born American Cardinal Kevin Farrell, presided over the burial rite.Just a few cardinals and the close circle of the Pope's Vatican family took part in the ceremony.Briege Chambers had watched the funeral before attending Mass at Clonard MonasteryMass-goers at Clonard Monastery in west Belfast also paid tribute to the late Pope on Saturday.Briege Chambers, who watched the funeral, says the atmosphere was "absolutely magnificent, we could feel it even though we weren't present in Rome at the time, but I think it radiated out.""It was very sad, but everybody has to die, don't they?", said another churchgoer, Bridie McCabe.A third, Rosa, said: "When any pope dies, I think there are a lot of people who want to pay their respects. But particularly this man."ReutersPope Francis appeared before crowds on Easter Sunday at St Peter's Square in the VaticanPope Francis died at the age of 88 on Easter Monday after weeks of ill health.The Vatican said he died following a stroke, less than 24 hours after appearing in a wheelchair at St Peter's Square to lead an Easter address in front of thousands of worshippers.Cardinal Farrell, was the one to break the news.He then became the "camerlengo", or the person who runs the Vatican after the death or resignation of a pope.Pope Francis nominated the cardinal for the role in 2019. The cardinal will remain in the position during the "Apostolica Sedes Vacans", the period between the death or resignation of a pope until the election of the next pontiff.What happens next?Today marks the beginning of a nine-day mourning period called Novemdiales, with a Mass held every day in memory of Francis.The Catholic world's attention will soon turn to the conclave – the ritual selection of Francis' successor where eligible cardinals gather in Vatican City to vote in secret.As camerlengo, Cardinal Farrell will be tasked with making arrangements for the conclave.The cardinals haven't confirmed a date yet, but the conclave typically takes place between 15 to 20 days after the pope's death. That would indicate a date after 6 May is likely.More on this storyA simple wooden coffin amidst extraordinary opulenceLeaders of Irish church and state travel to Rome for Pope's funeralPeople across NI and Ireland remember a 'unique' PopePope FrancisRoman Catholic ChurchMichelle O'NeillNorthern IrelandRelatedPope Francis wanted to 'create a more fraternal world'17 hrs agoEnglandEnd conflict to honour Pope, Vatican diplomat tells South Sudan20 hrs agoAfricaImages of Pope Francis's tomb released21 hrs agoEuropeMore5 mins agoEx-Irish police officer  'honoured' to lead Disappeared investigationMr Henry's appointment marks the first time someone from An Garda Síochána has taken the role. 5 mins ago2 hrs agoAirbus confirms deal for Spirit operations in BelfastThe deal was first announced in July last year as part of a wider break up of the Spirit business.2 hrs agoNorthern Ireland2 hrs agoFemale golfer to be honoured with Blue PlaqueMay Hezlet, from Aghadowey, won her first golf competition at the age of 11. 2 hrs agoNorthern Ireland2 hrs agoDaughter of murdered MP calls for Kneecap apologyVideo emerged of a 2023 gig appearing to show a band member saying: "The only good Tory is a dead Tory."2 hrs agoNorthern Ireland9 hrs agoKneecap 'kill MP' footage being assessed by policeVideo has emerged of a gig in 2023 appearing to show one band member saying: "The only good Tory is a dead Tory."9 hrs agoNorthern IrelandBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.
