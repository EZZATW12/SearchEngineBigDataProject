Then loans she took out for his multiple failed business ventures. Finally, there came an eviction notice as she said he had stopped contributing towards rent, leaving her to shoulder all the expenses for their family, which included three children.Despite this, they stayed together for close to a decade - even though he was also physically abusive."He's very smart... I was in love with his smartness, his big dreams. But he couldn't follow them up with actions. His pride was his downfall," she said.Even when he managed to get some money, he still did not contribute."He started withholding whatever money he had for himself. He'd go out drinking with his friends, come back - the salary is gone," she said.Legal financial expert Somila Gogoba says that beyond the control of money, financial abuse often has deep psychological roots."For the abuser, this behaviour may stem from feelings of inadequacy, fear of abandonment, or the need for dominance," she told the BBC."For the victim, the psychological impact includes feelings of worthlessness, fear, and dependence, which can be paralysing."Research from the University of South Africa suggests these are not isolated cases – and that women who out-earn their partners face significantly higher risks of intimate partner violence.Out of their in-depth study of 10 women who were the primary breadwinners of their families, only two were married."For eight of the participants, their choice of being single resulted from their experiences of physical, emotional and sexual violence… All the women said they believed that their role as female breadwinners was viewed as threatening to the traditional male role of a provider," said researcher Bianca Parry.Ms Gogoba says female breadwinners are less valued than their male counterparts, despite their economic contributions: "This cultural backdrop can encourage some partners to feel entitled to control the finances, even when they do not contribute equally."This control is not just about money - it is also about power and maintaining a grip on the relationship dynamics."Nombulelo Shange, sociologist lecturer at the University of the Free State, says it is part of a growing pattern in South Africa of middle-class women being financially exploited."Black women face a double patriarchy: Western expectations at work, traditional expectations at home. When these collide, harmful ideologies escalate," she told the BBC.She explained that balancing the pressures of being a successful woman, but playing the role of "the caregiver, the mother, the good wife, the good neighbour and community member who goes to church every Sunday", was difficult as women were always taught to tiptoe around men's egos.Since Dr Ndaba's revelations, women on social media have shared stories of giving their male partners their debit or credit cards when they go out to eat so it appears as though he is paying for the meal.For Ms Shange this shows how the burden of a happy home is often placed on the woman's shoulders."You think: 'If I just get them a car, they'll be happy.' Love makes you blind. When your person struggles, you struggle too - you want to fix it," she said.By the time the university lecturer divorced her husband, she was left with debts of 140,000 rand ($7,500; £5,600) - all racked up in her name."Before, I could plan things like holidays. Now they are a luxury," she said.Dr Ndaba has been at pains to tell her followers, as she did on one vlog: "Finance is an important aspect of people's marriages."The lecturer could not agree more, urging young women to take their time when getting to know their partners and have open, honest conversations."Talk about the finances, talk about your background, talk about emotions and character."Ms Gogoba urged more people to protect themselves from their partner, telling them to keep a separate bank account, keep their pins secure and monitor their credit cards.They all agreed that women should understand that love should not come with an unsustainable price tag.You may also be interested in:Oscar Pistorius release: A reminder of South Africa's femicide problemWill I be next?
