A lot of us are still angry, confused, sad, devastated - and some of us don't know how to feel, what to feel," says R. J. Aquino, chairman of Filipino B.C., the organisation which put on the festival. He spoke at a vigil attended by hundreds of people from across the Lower Mainland on Sunday night."Honestly, I'm kind of all of the above right now," he adds.Those who had been at the festival site all day were left with an intense feeling of shock, sorrow and fury in the aftermath of the attack.Roger Peralta and Bjorn Villarreal, friends who both arrived in Canada in 2016, spent the evening listening to the music and eating the food of their homeland."Suddenly I hear this unimaginable noise," Bjorn recalls."It was a loud bang," Roger says.Both men describe seeing bodies bouncing off an SUV just meters away from them."I did not run away," Bjorn continues. "I actually followed the vehicle, because I felt like I could stop him. "It was horrendous. A lot of people [were] just lying on the street and crying and begging for help."Almost a day later, Roger is still in shock and unable to sleep as the scene replays in his mind. He says he is finding himself having to stop and cry.But he also spoke of a strong Filipino spirit which he says will lift the community."We have in our culture Bayanihan," he explains, which translates as a spirit of unity and cooperation among Filipinos."When you meet another Filipino, even if you don't know them, you greet them, you feel like they're family, even if you're not."ReutersPeople have been placing candles and flowers at a makeshift memorial near the scene of Saturday's car-rammingThe Premier of British Columbia, David Eby, has also paid tribute to the Filipino community in Canada, saying he didn't "think there's a British Columbian who hasn't been touched in some way by the Filipino community". "You can't go to a place that delivers care in our province and not meet a member of that community," he said."Our long-term care homes, our hospitals, childcare, schools. This is a community that gives and gives."Bjorn, who works at a hospital as a magnetic resonance imaging technologist, agrees."We are very caring people," he says. Both he and Roger were furious the SUV got into the crowd in the first place. They said they felt let down by Canada.Premier Eby said he feels that rage too."But I want to turn the rage that I feel into ensuring that we stand with the Filipino community," he said as he stood in front of a police cruiser blocking access to the crime scene."This event does not define us and the Filipino community or that celebration."Suspect charged after Vancouver car ramming leaves 11 deadWhat we know about the Vancouver car ramming attackUS & CanadaVancouverCanadaRelatedObama, the border and a headdress: The Pope's visits to North America6 days agoUS & CanadaWatch: Toronto plane crash footage analysed by aviation experts18 Feb 2025US & CanadaAll passengers survive crash landing as plane flips at Toronto airport18 Feb 2025US & CanadaMore52 mins agoWhen will we get results of the Canada election?Here's how - and when - we will know who won the election and will form the new government in Canada.52 mins agoUS & Canada1 hr agoGirl, 5, among Vancouver dead as suspect chargedAt least 10 others were killed after a car drove into a crowd at a street festival in Vancouver, Canada on Saturday night. 1 hr agoUS & Canada2 hrs agoThe 'Trump effect' and other things to watch for as Canada votesThe BBC's Lyse Doucet breaks down the key issues weighing on voters minds as Canadians cast their ballots.2 hrs agoUS & Canada5 hrs agoCanada votes in pivotal election transformed by TrumpThe US president came to dominate on the campaign trail, with the contest being viewed as a referendum on how Canada should engage with him.5 hrs agoUS & Canada7 hrs agoWhat we know about the Vancouver car ramming attackA resident of the city has been charged with murder and work to identify victims is ongoing. 7 hrs agoUS & CanadaBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.
