He was rescued again on Saturday after suffering from altitude sickness but is now out of danger.Due to harsh conditions, people are discouraged from climbing Mount Fuji outside of the official climbing season that starts in early July and ends in early September.All trails leading to Mount Fuji's summit are closed at this time, according to the environment ministry.Following the man's rescue, police in Shizuoka prefecture reiterated its advice against climbing the mountain during off-season as the weather could suddenly change, making it hard for rescuers to respond. Medical facilities along the trails are also closed.Posts by some X users criticised the man for ignoring the safety advice against climbing at the time, saying he should be made to pay for both rescue missions. Renowned all over the world for its perfect cone shape, the 3,776m (12,388ft) high Mount Fuji is one of Japan's most popular attractions and authorities have in recent years taken steps to address overtourism by raising climbing fees.In 2023, more than 220,000 people climbed Mount Fuji between July and September.Snow back on Mount Fuji after longest absenceJapan blocks iconic Mt Fuji view to deter touristsAsiaJapanRelated'Her legacy will slay': Drag Race stars mourn Jiggly Caliente4 hrs agoAsiaN Korea confirms it sent troops to fight for Russia in Ukraine war5 hrs agoAsiaMyanmar's army vowed a ceasefire after the earthquake.
