But in March, the family told BBC News that the star died from cardiac arrest caused by the effects of taking ketamine.Since making the announcement, they've been working with substance abuse charity Adferiad to raise awareness and tackle stigma around the drug, something Chanel says is an "important step" in those facing addiction."It's hard for me because I think if that stigma wasn't there, would my brother have sought the help he needed?" she says."To think that if we'd known, or if he'd have felt able to talk and really reach out for the help that was needed, the outcome could've been different."That's why we've shared James's story."Chanel and her family are also campaigning for the government to re-classify ketamine from its current status as a Class B drug to Class A, which would put it in the same category as heroin and cocaine."There's a portion of younger people that maybe look at that classification and think it's less harmful than other drugs," she says."But it's not just about reclassification […] it needs to include education, police, health, to really raise awareness. We need a strategy around drug usage and drug deaths in the UK."Chanel WilliamsChanel said their family found it "extremely difficult" to talk about James's death but that they hoped "something positive could come from the complete tragedy"The UK government is currently seeking experts' advice on the re-classification of ketamine, with Policing Minister Dame Diana Johnson writing to the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) expressing concern over the rise in young people taking the drug.A spokesperson for the Home Office said: "Our thoughts are with James's family and friends, and all those affected by this tragic death, which has sadly reinforced once again the serious dangers of taking ketamine."We will not hesitate to act when the ACMD reports back, and in the meantime, we will continue to work across health, policing and wider public services to drive down drug use and stop those who profit from its supply."Chanel said it had been difficult to share the information about how James had passed away but that the family "talked about what we can do"."The Vivienne left a legacy as a trailblazing icon and this, I feel, is James's legacy. To help other people," she says."If I can help one family to not feel what we are feeling, then it's all worth it."You can see the full interview with The Vivienne's sister Chanel on BBC Newsnight at 10:30 on BBC Two and BBC iPlayer.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.
