Known for her catchphrase "Bish Bash Bosh", Mrs Murphy said she never expected so many people to engage with her content.She added: "It's mind-blowing honestly, because I'm just in my kitchen and I don't realise that the outside world are watching!"I feel like it's a such a relatable thing to do because everyone is constantly having to think 'what's for dinner tonight?'"TikTok/Rebecca MurphyMrs Murphy films herself as she dishes up dinner every night on TikTokMrs Murphy films her videos with her phone in a holder designed for the car, which she then speeds up and adds a voiceover to before publishing. Speaking to BBC Radio WM, Mrs Murphy explained how she dealt with negative comments and being online. "I'm just a normal person, having that many followers doesn't make you anything special," she said."You have to have thick skin. Because of my age, I feel like maybe I can cope a bit easier."There comes a point where you do just need to switch your phone off but I am so privileged to have this as my job."When asked how to achieve TikTok fame, Mrs Murphy said her biggest piece of advice was to post consistently. "Post the video, I know it sounds ridiculous but don't worry about the editing and making it perfect," she said."People don't like perfection because that's not real life."Follow BBC Birmingham on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.More like this'TikTok helped me after I became a widow at 24'The young vicar with millions of views on TikTok 'Roll your eyes if you want, I'm a star': TikTok to hold first awards showGrandad Sings: The 92-year-old TikTok sensationTikTokGreat BarrFoodRelatedTeens caught using replica gun for TikTok video2 days agoTeesLondon Marathon: TikTok Bus racer shares last-minute tips3 days agoLondonBereaved parents demand tech firms 'protect children'4 days agoTechnologyMore4 hrs agoFood growing scheme launched at city churchThe Rev Annie Blyth says the church has been chosen by The Big Issue due to its focus on community.4 hrs agoNorfolk2 days agoExtra helpings of food festival after cancellationThe eat:Nailsea festival returns with two events, featuring 100 producers and local street food.2 days agoBristol3 days agoHomeless veterans 'get lives back in the kitchen'A new initiative is teaching former military personnel basic cooking skills.3 days agoGloucestershire5 days agoWoman's cancer operation filmed in awareness driveKelly Buckle lets cameras film her operation to try to raise awareness about early cancer detection.5 days agoBirmingham & Black Country5 days agoAre breakfast cereals good or bad for us?Fortified breakfast cereals can be a useful source of fibre, vitamins and minerals – but some are considered ultra-processed food.5 days agoFutureBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.
