"It just swept her away, it just took her."After the inquest, Nick Blackburn, chief executive of Lingfield Education Trust, which runs the school, said: "Almost a year has passed since this heartbreaking tragedy, and our primary thoughts today remain with the family and loved ones of Leah, who are having to cope with an unimaginable loss."We continue to be there for them and to remember Leah as a special part of our school community."Follow BBC Tees on X, Facebook, Nextdoor and Instagram.
