M&S in Sunderland closed last May because of "changing customer habits", with proposals to flatten part or all of the High Street West building.However, the council has stated its commitment to keeping the facade "intact" in line with the masterplan for the Riverside Sunderland development.Councillor Kevin Johnston, portfolio holder for business, housing and regeneration, said feasibility studies were under way."All of the plans for Riverside Sunderland – some of which have been in the public domain for years - have stipulated that we will do everything we can as a council to ensure the existing facade remains intact, and this remains the case," he said.Johnston added there would be more details in the coming months, with the council "committed" to working with successful bidders to "figure out the art of the possible and ensure the redevelopment delivers the best possible outcome for the city".Sunderland City CouncilThe former M&S building is set to form part of Sunderland's Central Business DistrictThe future of the building's frontage was brought up during a meeting of the Labour-run city council at the end of March.Former Conservative councillor Greg Peacock asked if the leader of the local authority Michael Mordey would commit to protecting the structure.  In response, Mordey said the master plan for Riverside Sunderland had "demonstrated the council's intention to retain" the facade."We're progressing with the next phase of the Riverside Sunderland Development along High Street West," Mordey told the meeting."The council's design team is currently finalising feasible development proposals."He added the design proposals for High Street West would be made available for consultation later this year ahead of a planning application. 'Never under threat'After the meeting, Sunderland Conservatives, who campaigned to preserve the building, said it was a "triumph for local heritage and community advocacy".Councillor Lyall Reed said: "This is a fantastic outcome for Sunderland. The front of the old M&S building is a beautiful piece of our city's history, and we're thrilled that our campaign has succeeded in securing its protection."But Labour's Kevin Johnston said the Conservatives claiming "they have somehow secured its protection is complete nonsense" as plans for Riverside Sunderland had stipulated the council would  do "everything we can" to ensure the façade remained "intact"."I would like to congratulate the Sunderland Conservatives on the incredible achievement of saving something that was never under threat," he said."Feasibility studies looking into the art of the possible for the future of the facade are already under way, and the Conservatives are fully aware of the fact."A bid to get a listed status for the building by Sunderland Conservatives last year was unsuccessful.
