Clothing and home departments would occupy part of the ground floor and a new first-floor space. Additional space would be used for staff facilities and storage.The M&S store in Whitefriargate, Hull city centre, closed six years agoIn addition to the Kingswood store, M&S operates "Simply Food" halls in Anlaby and Beverley. The Kingswood store would be the first to offer clothing and homeware in the city since the closure of the Whitefriargate store in 2019.David Hooper, a director at Hull and Humber Chamber of Commerce, described the announcement as "great news". "M&S is one of the major high street brands and it has been missed from the city," he said. "To see them come back will be welcomed by shoppers and the public."Ross, a Liberal Democrat who represents the Beverley and Newland Ward, said: "Marks and Spencer's news is a massive sign of confidence in the local economy here in Hull."This will improve the offer to residents across the city and help us attract more people to Hull and the surrounding area."Will Smith, head of property at M&S, said: "We are delighted to see the submission of this planning application for a new full-line M&S store in Hull. "This marks a significant milestone in our commitment to modernising our UK store estate and ensuring we are in the right locations to serve our customers."Listen to highlights from Hull and East Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, watch the latest episode of Look North or tell us about a story you think we should be covering here.More on this storyProposal lodged for M&S food hall in BostonIs 'England's oldest joke shop' having last laugh?M&S boss says retailers 'raided like a piggy bank'Related internet linksMarks and SpencerHullRetailingHull City CouncilMarks & SpencerRelatedArt gallery to be filled with technicolour display5 hrs agoHull & East Yorkshire'Finish lines not finish times' at London Marathon18 hrs agoLondonZachariah Pearson's generous gift and popular myth explored1 day agoHull & East YorkshireMore21 hrs agoM&S online disruption a 'bruise' to reputation, analyst saysOnline orders have been paused on the retail giant's website and app since Friday. 21 hrs agoBusiness2 days agoM&S stops online orders and issues refunds after cyber attackThe firm has stopped taking orders on its website and apps, including for food and clothes.2 days agoTechnology3 days agoFountains to remain closed over water safety fearsHull City Council says issues with an internal mechanism "can affect water quality".3 days agoHull & East Yorkshire3 days agoRetail sales see biggest rise for nearly four yearsSales rose for the third month in a row in March as warmer weather helped to boost trade.3 days agoBusiness4 days agoViews sought on 200 new homes near shopping centreHull City Council is to hold a consultation on its proposals for near St Stephen's Shopping Centre.4 days agoHull & East YorkshireBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.
