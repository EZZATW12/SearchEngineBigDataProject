Despite the deal, Israel has struck targets it says are linked to Hezbollah almost every day. The Israeli government has said that it will respond to any perceived threats from Hezbollah.Western officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, have told the BBC that the militant group has been largely compliant with the truce, while accusing Israel of multiple violations that include air strikes and drone surveillance.Live footage streamed by Reuters showed a giant plume of smoke billowing from the targeted building an hour after the Israeli army issued an evacuation order to residents of the Hadath neighbourhood.Lebanon's Civil Defence later said that no casualties had been recorded and rescue crews had extinguished the fire.In a statement on X following the strike, the Lebanese Presidency said that President Joseph Aoun condemned the attack."The United States and France, as guarantors of the cessation of hostilities agreement, must assume their responsibilities and compel Israel to immediately cease its attacks," it wrote."Israel's continued undermining of stability will exacerbate tensions and expose the region to real threats to its security and stability."Israel's government said that it had targeted a Hezbollah store of "precision-guided missiles"."The storage of missiles in this infrastructure site constitutes a blatant violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon, and poses a threat to the State of Israel and its civilians," the Israeli military said in a statement.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said that Israel "will not allow Hezbollah to grow stronger"."The Dahiyeh neighbourhood in Beirut will not serve as a safe haven for the terrorist organisation Hezbollah," it added.UN Special Coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, wrote on X that the strike "generated panic and fear of renewed violence among those desperate for a return to normalcy"."We urge all sides to halt any actions that could further undermine the cessation of hostilities understanding," she added.Earlier this month an Israeli airstrike in Beirut's southern suburbs killed four people, including a Hezbollah official.Schools in Beirut suburb fear return to war after new Israeli strikesIsrael strikes Lebanon after first rocket attack since ceasefireWhat is Hezbollah and why has it been fighting Israel?IsraelHezbollahLebanonRelatedQatar claims slight progress towards ceasefire in Gaza14 hrs agoMiddle EastUN agency runs out of food aid in Gaza after Israeli blockade3 days agoMiddle EastIsrael's muted response to Pope Francis's death signals tensions over Gaza3 days agoMiddle EastMore11 Apr 2025Schools in Beirut suburb fear return to war after new Israeli strikesStudents, staff, and parents alike are traumatised by what has happened and the destruction that surrounds them.11 Apr 2025Middle East4 Apr 2025Hezbollah at crossroads after blows from war weaken groupThe BBC's Hugo Bachega explores the future for Hezbollah in the wake of Israel's devastating attacks.4 Apr 2025Middle East3 Apr 2025Men arrested over suspected links to HezbollahThe men, aged 39 and 35, were arrested over suspected links to banned group Hezbollah.3 Apr 2025London1 Apr 2025Four killed in Israeli strike on Beirut, Lebanon says, despite ceasefireThe Israeli military said it targeted a Hezbollah operative in the southern suburbs of Lebanon's capital.1 Apr 2025Middle East28 Mar 2025Israel conducts first strike on Beirut since Hezbollah ceasefireThe strike, which Israel said hit a Hezbollah site, occurred hours after two rockets were fired from southern Lebanon towards northern Israel.28 Mar 2025Middle EastBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.
