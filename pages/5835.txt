He also helped her take medication and performed odd jobs.During this period, he faked a cancer diagnosis to gain the family's sympathy, his trial heard.It got to the point where "he was always there" with the Baxters, family friend Kate Dawson told the BBC.A web of false personalitiesFamily handoutStephen and Carol Baxter welcomed D'Wit into their close-knit family lifeWhen Ellena found her parents dead in their armchairs on Easter Sunday 2023, she immediately suspected carbon monoxide poisoning was to blame.It was not until post-mortem examinations took place that fentanyl and promethazine were found to be a significant factor in both deaths.A falsified will inside the couple's home in Victory Road, which named D'Wit as director of Cazsplash, led detectives to the killer.Upon his arrest, they began to uncover the extreme lengths D'Wit explored to control the Baxters.His manipulation mainly targeted Carol Baxter, who suffered from the thyroid condition Hashimoto's disease.He created a fake doctor, called Andrea Bowden, who gave Mrs Baxter advice about her condition and put her in touch with a wide network of pretend patients.Mrs Baxter desperately wanted solidarity, and on one occasion, the couple drove three hours to a hotel to meet one of the false identities who cancelled on them at the last minute.The moment a suspected double murderer is arrestedPolice seized 80 electronic devices at D'Wit's house, some of which had been used to create more than 20 false personas used for his manipulation.Analysis of the devices found he was offering advice "with no clinical basis" while posing as Dr Bowden, prosecutors told the trial.This advice included taking smoothies that were rich in health benefits made by D'Wit, who Dr Bowden praised as a good friend.Instead, they were cocktails of drugs and potions which made her far more unwell than she already was.Ellena told jurors D'Wit used Dr Bowden to enforce "this set of rules we had to follow" for her mother's treatment.But the dementia-like symptoms and deterioration Mrs Baxter was suffering from were not typical of Hashimoto's.They were the effects of her being slowly poisoned by D'Wit, who ensured Mrs Baxter kept him updated on her decline via video messages she sent to Dr Bowden.The police investigation uncovered an email sent by D'Wit to the couple on the morning of their deaths, detailing a "liver cleanse recipe" they should follow.It explained how the fatal dose of fentanyl had been administered into their bodies.D'Wit then watched them die between Good Friday and Easter Sunday in a video stream he set up from a phone hidden in their property.Why did D'Wit carry out the murders?Essex PoliceA doorbell camera on the Baxters' house showed D'Wit leaving after ensuring they took lethal doses of fentanylSentencing D'Wit, the Honourable Mr Justice Lavender said he was motivated by a "desire to control others"."Deciding whether another person lives or dies is the ultimate form of control," he said.D'Wit used fentanyl patches prescribed to his late father, Vernon, to carry out the murders.The BBC revealed in July that detectives were also reviewing the deaths of D'Wit's father and grandfather in case he had killed them and avoided detection.Both opened and unopened patches were found in a bag at his home by police, as well as metal tacks.The same tacks were found during a scan of Mrs Baxter's stomach when she was alive."Your relationship with the Baxters and Carol Baxter's illness had led the Baxters to trust you to prepare supposed health drinks for her for some time," the judge said."This is what gave you the opportunity to do what you did."John Fairhall/BBCThe couple were found dead in the conservatory by their daughterMr Justice Lavender criticised D'Wit's "amateurish" attempt to create a will, which named him as their "dear friend".However, it was suggested the will was more of an afterthought rather than the ultimate motivation.The judge said D'Wit maintained his grip over the family in the three months between the murders and his arrest by targeting Ellena.He did so by taking her out for dinner on the night he killed the Baxters, as well as arranging the funeral and using one of the false identities to console her.In a final attempt at manipulation, he used a wheelchair throughout the trial in what prosecutors said was an effort to gain the jury's sympathy.Addressing the killer, the judge concluded: "What you did was cruel and senseless."Essex Millionaire Murders airs on ITV1 at 9pm on both
