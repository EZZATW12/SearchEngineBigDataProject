Conflict is a more reliable catalyst for music.Just don't tell Oklahoma singer-songwriter Samantha Crain, who's about to release her seventh album, Gumshoe.Full of bewildering beauty and life-affirming anthems, it was written over the last three years, as she unexpectedly fell in love."I spent much of my life as a lone wolf," she tells BBC News, "so hyper-independent that it became a defining trait.""But as I explored vulnerability and reciprocity in my relationships, I realised… we can change by the minute, and that's okay."In my ancestors' Choctaw language, there are no words for 'is' or 'are,' reflecting their belief that people, animals, and plants are not permanent or static. That's the biggest lesson of the past few years: I can be a lone wolf sometimes and still belong to a community."That realisation manifests in the lovestruck slacker rock of Dragonfly, and the finger-plucked Neptune Baby, with its refrain, "I'm a boat, and you are the water".Not that Crain's relationship was all plain sailing. Her new partner struggles with addiction, and a track called Melatonin finds her listing the items she brought them in rehab – "mint choc-chip ice cream, cigarettes, a watch"."You got it bad, but you got me," she reassures.It's an album of stunning poetic clarity and emotion – typified by the title track, an old-time country-rock ballad inspired by her love of detective novels."The word 'Gumshoe' has been in every writing notebook since I was a teenager," she says. "After watching The Maltese Falcon, I considered how detached detective characters are and imagined two loners finding love."Instantly, gumshoe came to mind—the perfect word for a song about unravelling the mystery of relationships."Other highlights this weekTrump: The First 100 Days is out on BBC One and iPlayer on MondayP Diddy: The Rise and Fall is out on BBC Three and iPlayer on MondayMy Next Breath, a memoir by Jeremy Renner, is out on TuesdayGenius Game, with David Tennant, starts on ITV on WednesdaySuspect: The Shooting of Jean Charles De Menezes drops on Disney+ on WednesdayMan Like Mobeen returns on Thursday on BBC Three and iPlayerTaskmaster returns on Channel 4 on ThursdayThe Last Journey hits cinemas on ThursdayTelevisionCultureMarvel ComicsBBCFilmMusicRelatedDrag Race and Pose star Jiggly Caliente dies aged 4418 hrs agoWorldWallace seeks 'space to heal' after saying claims against him 'not all true'2 days agoCultureCelebrity Big Brother 2025 winner revealed3 days agoCultureMore1 hr agoNew film set to attract 'more tourists' to areaThe film showcases Minehead, Porlock and other locations along the Exmoor Coast. 1 hr agoSomerset5 hrs agoRadiohead reimagined with classical twist in home cityLondon Concertante's Radiohead Reimagined plays Christ Church Cathedral in Oxford.5 hrs agoOxfordshire9 hrs agoRock & Roll Hall of Fame picks Outkast but not OasisVoters pick Outkast and Cyndi Lauper for induction, but overlook Oasis, Mariah Carey and New Order.9 hrs agoCulture12 hrs agoKneecap 'kill MP' footage being assessed by policeVideo has emerged of a gig in 2023 appearing to show one band member saying: "The only good Tory is a dead Tory."12 hrs agoNorthern Ireland20 hrs agoThe Lightning Seeds to headline Sussex NHS gig  Ian Broudie and his band are raising money for seven hospitals across Sussex. 20 hrs agoSussexBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.
