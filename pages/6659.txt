But when weather and time take their toll, chunks of the plastic-based paint can flake off and litter the streets with non-recyclable plastics.Spotting an opportunity to help the environment and try to make something beautiful, Daniel Dowson began collecting the fragments of paint."I took it back home and I started experimenting with it," he says."I thought 'wow, I could do something with this'."I was studying product design at the time at university, so I was very familiar with lots of materials."After four years of working with the paint, Mr Dowson now says he can spot the difference between graffiti from different cities - with materials from London, Paris and Sheffield all revealing their own colours."They can vary depending on the wall, the city, paint trends, sometimes there's a few layers of certain colours," he says.Josh Herman/BBCDaniel Dowson began making jewellery from paint scraps four years agoMr Dowson collected his first flecks of paint from the ground at Mount Pleasant Park in Sheffield, where he was skateboarding, four-and-a-half years ago.Now he creates jewellery and artwork from the fragments."Initially it was working with what I had and what I could use. At that earlier stage I didn't realise polishing it revealed so many textures and layers, and complicated patterns."So, I was doing rudimentary jewellery with chunks of paint. And eventually it developed as I learnt how to use the material properly," he says.Mr Dowson says he started out sanding the chunks of paint on his skateboard, but now after experimenting with a host of tools he is able to create "psychedelic gobstoppers of colour"."One piece of paint can go very far, because it's made of layers I'm able to split it up and turn it into thinner sheets," he say."So, I don't need much of this to do the magic."It's different every time and these colours have a wonderful effect on the imagination. I find it therapeutic, I really get into the zone."The thing I enjoy most is looking through the paint and finding colour combinations that are unique."It's random every time so I never know what I'm going to reveal."The technique took some experimentation, he says, involving sandpaper, chisels, woodworking tools, razor blades and even a laser cutter."Initially I put it in the bath to heat up the paint, I also put it in the oven but my housemates didn't appreciate that – toxic paint fumes aren't good. But I've now refined it," he says."It was a matter of pure commitment and I had to keep experimenting with it."Josh Herman/BBCLayers of paint from the graffiti can be seen through a magnifying lensWhile Mr Dowson is removing some graffiti from the streets, he is careful to make sure he does not destroy any art work."If it would ruin the artwork by pulling a bit of paint off the wall then I won't do it," he says."However, if it's deteriorating so much the paints already on the floor, it's good for the environment because the paint is plastic-based."I've always been very environmentally conscious. I love recycling, a lot of the things I do as a designer have been about recycling and looking at materials differently."Listen to highlights from South Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look NorthRelated stories'I turn rude graffiti into wholesome murals'Home of Banksy's early graffiti is sold for £650,000SheffieldGraffitiRelatedBoy admits stabbing 15-year-old to death at school11 mins agoSouth YorkshireFood co-op secures home on 15th birthday 5 hrs agoSouth YorkshireGang murder victim remembered 100 years on1 day agoSouth YorkshireMore6 Apr 2025Waking up with a Banksy on your wall: The differing fortunes of two homeownersTwo homeowners had very different experiences when the elusive artist chose their walls for his work.6 Apr 2025Culture4 Apr 2025Reward offered to catch Guildford graffiti vandalThe graffiti tag Wormy is so prolific in Guildford that Crimestoppers are stepping in.4 Apr 2025Surrey14 Mar 2025Home of Banksy's early graffiti is sold for £650,000Banksy's stencilled tag is visible above an image of an animal on one of the building's walls.14 Mar 2025Bristol13 Mar 2025Racist graffiti scrawled on memorial benchesThe benches have been removed for cleaning, a spokesperson for East Riding of Yorkshire Council says.13 Mar 20252 Mar 2025Family 'scared' after racist attack on new homeIt happened at a block of flats on Roden Street off the Donegall Road on Thursday night. 2 Mar 2025Northern IrelandBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.
