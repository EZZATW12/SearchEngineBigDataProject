The exhibition will be on display at the city's Central Library from 28 April to 10 May.A small selection of images is also on show in K Teas Cakes cafe on St George's Parade, while a pop-up gallery has been planned in the 01902 Urban Rooms on Queen Square in December. Graham StubbsA portrait of Caty, who runs K Teas cakes, is in the exhibition, and others images are on display in her shopMr Stubbs told the BBC he was "saddened that Wolverhampton doesn't always have a great name"."I wanted to do something positive to show these wonderful individuals and talk about what the city means to them," he said. "I hope that in a small way it will encourage some more dialogue and understanding in the city."So far, more than 30 people have been photographed for the project, which has been under way for a year and is open-ended and still taking on participants.Mr Stubbs said: "I came to Wolverhampton about 10 years ago, and now it feels like home. "I spent some of that time working for Citizens Advice, and I'm also very involved in the local art scene. This has allowed me to meet many wonderful people and see different sides of the city."I am doing this because I want to show different people with different takes on the city in a positive way."Graham StubbsA portrait from the exhibition of Abrar and Khalid, who represent the UKIM Madina Masjid & Islamic Centre on New Hampton RoadFollow BBC Wolverhampton & Black Country on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.More on this storyExhibition to capture city's 'spirit'Related internet linksWe are Wolverhampton ExhibitionArtWolverhamptonRelatedCeramic cats purchased by museum 'huge mews'4 hrs agoBeds, Herts & BucksRadiohead reimagined with classical twist in home city5 hrs agoOxfordshireArt gallery to be filled with technicolour display5 hrs agoHull & East YorkshireMore5 hrs agoSchool extends staff parking with demolition planWodensfield Primary School in Wolverhampton wants to knock down a former caretaker's bungalow.5 hrs agoWolverhampton5 hrs agoTaxi panic switches set to be permitted in taxisThe council is set to allow audio recording in cabs following assaults on taxi drivers.5 hrs agoEngland19 hrs agoCity nightclub announces closureThe venue, which opened in 2013, says it will close next month after "one massive last party".19 hrs agoWolverhampton1 day agoYour photos: Swathes of bluebells, sheep and boatsTake a look at some of your best images from across the West Midlands over the past week.1 day agoEngland1 day agoFirms encouraged to join apprenticeships schemeSo far, more than 5,000 apprentices have been recruited across the West Midlands.1 day agoEnglandBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.
