The work applicants, Innova Renewables, had also agreed to create wildlife habitats.Stratford-on-Avon District Council's planning committee passed the proposals by four votes to three.The overall site covers 81 hectares of land, with panels covering 46 hectares across five agricultural fields.Conservative councillor Anne Parry and three parish councils, Newbold Pacey & Ashorne, Moreton Morrell and Lighthorne, all voiced objections to the scheme.A total of 276 representations against the plans were also submitted, which included one from Conservative MP for Kenilworth and Southam, Sir Jeremy Wright.Independent councillor Trevor Harvey said national planning guidance told councillors to give significant weight to renewable energy applications.The contractor "has gone a long way to make changes to accommodate the criticisms made", he added, which included not placing panels on higher ground.However, Conservative councillor Daren Pemberton said the plans would "undoubtedly harm" the rural patch."We have seen a plethora of these sites in a relatively confined area, and that has an adverse impact on local communities," he said.Conservative councillor Bill Fleming voted against the plans and added he was "hugely concerned" by the amount of agricultural land lost in Warwickshire."We are an agricultural county; it is one of the things we are famous for, and there is a constant erosion of farmland being taken away," he said.Permission for the farm lasts for 40 years, after which the land has to be returned to its former condition.Follow BBC Coventry & Warwickshire on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.
