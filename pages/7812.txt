This is where the Atlantic once met the venerable Uwharrie Mountains, 145km inland; when the ocean pulled away, it left behind the grit that gave the region its name.The region is one of the last homes for unique flora and fauna like the southern hognose snake and the Carolina gopher frog, both of which are endangered. What it's also known for, though, is something that has university researchers, foodies and conspiracy theorists all scratching their heads. It's a rare and coveted honey in a deep shade of aubergine-purple, and no one knows for sure what gives it the hue.People largely travel to the Sandhills region for open-air adrenaline pursuits and laid-back rural charm – think corn mazes, trout fishing and country fair-style Americana.The prestigious Pinehurst Golf Resort, commonly referred to as the "cradle of American golf", is here (don't miss its celebrated No 2 course), as is the horse riding hub Southern Pines and its abundance of equestrian trails and backcountry trekking. Kayakers and canoers flock to Drowning Creek, drawn by the scenic 13-mile route from Turnpike Road to Highway 401.Rusty BerlewPurple honey is a sweet Southern secret – and no one knows precisely why it happens (Credit: Rusty Berlew)Hunting classic Southern game like white-tailed deer, wild turkey and wood ducks is popular in these parts, with extensive land preserves designated for conservation to support the pursuit. The longleaf pine forests are themselves a thing of simple beauty, and twitchers come here to search for northern bobwhite quails, bald eagles and – the star attraction – imperilled red-cockaded woodpeckers with their binoculars.World's TableBBC.com's World's Table "smashes the kitchen ceiling" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.But travellers also come to the region to seek out something even more extraordinary than threatened species and unique biomes. Here, if the conditions are exactly right (a mystery even to the experts) and the timing is perfect (a secret only the bees know), apiarists will visit their hives and find not just frames brimming with a slow and sultry river of liquid gold, but perhaps one that gleams with deep violet treasure."It is true that nobody knows what causes purple honey," says Paige Burns, who has a degree in horticulture and works with farmers and foresters in her role as the Richmond County Extension Director. Theories abound, both of the folklore and pseudo-scientific variety, and much like a porch swing, everybody here has one.Burns tells me a few of the more popular speculations: that it's the alkalinity of the soil changing the honey's colour as it does hydrangeas from blue to pink; that it's wild berries surrounding the bee's territory; and, the one that sparks the most vociferous debate among locals, that it's the deep violet flower of the invasive (and wildly reviled) kudzu vine. Beekeepers in the area have reported finding the jewel-hued honey in their hives for years, but even so, its appearance is so sporadic and at the whim of chance, it continues to be a surprise when it does appear.Getty ImagesEven local beekeepers can't predict when they will find purple honey (Credit: Getty Images)Don Dees, who owns and operates Dees Bees Apiary in nearby Aberdeen, North Carolina, has purple honey on his website, but it's sold out. It's impossible to pre-sale for this year's harvest since no one knows how much, or even if, the bees will deign to colour the combs in plum or in the customary amber. Instead, he invites people to check his Facebook page for updates from mid-July. His pure raw honey costs $16.50 (£13) for 900g. Purple honey, when he has it, goes for $75 (about £58) for an 85g glass jar. Talk about finding treasure; this is a limited edition in every sense of the word.Plan your trip- If you’re looking to purchase your own jar of amethyst treasure, keep an eye out online for availability toward late July. Dees Bees Apiary tends to sell in smaller increments so more people have the chance to try it.- At other times of year, drop into local shops and farmers' markets to taste the distinct honey varieties grown here, from sourwood to apple blossom to tupelo, and if you’re lucky, some of the purple stuff, too.- Visitors can also take a honey tour with Honeybee Bliss, where suited-up guests play honey sommelier and take a turn at pulling bee-laden frames oozing with golden goo.Dees' take on the phenomenon? He refutes the lore that aluminium in the terrain plays a factor and insists that kudzu isn't part of the equation, reasoning his apiary would produce it every season if so. Purple honey is most likely to arise under drought-like conditions, he says, and Dees believes that blue-black huckleberries that grow on shrubs rooted in thirst-tolerant clay feed the hard-up-for-food bees that can't locate traditional more water-dependent blooms.However, Rusty Burlew, a master beekeeper who directs the Native Bee Conservancy of Washington State, says that a lot of circumstantial evidence points to the inky-violet flower of the kudzu, and she doubts that bees have the jaws necessary to pierce fruit for nectar. Flavour-wise, she says, "to my untrained palate, the honey really does taste purple, in a grape-y sort of way".Courtesy of Matt Lawrence/ Hawfield's Honey HouseThe best time to seek out purple honey is the summer months, from around July (Credit: Courtesy of Matt Lawrence/ Hawfield's Honey House)Burns tells me that she's never been one of the lucky ones to harvest the jammy-sweet treasure. "One of the beekeepers I work with, she's probably, as the crow flies, two miles from me. I'm on the creek; she's on the creek. Obviously, we're in a very similar environment. She regularly gets purple honey; I've never gotten it." Laughing, she adds that it's a surprise even to the bee farmers when they open the hive and find it. "Some years you get it, and then 10 years you don't."More like this:• The unexpected origins of Houston's favourite po' boy• The US island that once belonged to Russia• The US's ancient, underrated culinary capitalAnd here I am, a native to the state, with no idea such a wild-foraged wonder existed. Turns out some mysteries aren't just hidden; they're hidden in plain sight. That's the beauty of travel: not just the landscapes that render you speechless or the food that rewrites the rules, but the stories you stumble into along the way. The ones that don't come with tidy explanations or easy answers. There aren't many of those left.There's something incredible about standing under a sky unbothered by city lights, surrounded by the literal hum of a place still untamed, knowing that not even the beekeepers – who spend their days elbow-deep in the stuff – can tell you why this honey defies nature's colour wheel. Maybe we'll never know. And perhaps that's the point. Some places keep their secrets – and that's precisely what makes them worth the trip.-- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. For more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram. World's TableNatural WondersFood & DrinkFeaturesWatchWatch rare Gobi bear's reaction to finding waterSo rare they were thought to be a myth and undertake arduous journeys of up to 100 miles to find water.5 days agoNatural wondersThe spectacle of a great Pelican feeding bonanzaThe dam at Marsh Lake, Minnesota, has created an unexpected opportunity for pelicans.6 days agoNatural wondersInside one of the world's most remote restaurants'Off-Map Destination' winner Wolfgat offers a menu made from hyper-local and foraged ingredients.11 Apr 2025World's TableThe animal that was thought of as a hoaxDavid Attenborough on the discovery of the dumbfounding platypus.26 Mar 2025Natural wondersThe unique mammal that gives birth unlike any otherIn the 1980s, David Attenborough travels to Florida to meet the opossum in this groundbreaking documentary.5 Mar 2025Natural wondersThe perplexing history of the chameleonDavid Attenborough tells the story of the animal that once bewildered scientists.26 Feb 2025Natural wondersExperience David Attenborough's first expedition in colourFirst broadcast in 1954, the celebrated naturalist's first on-screen appearance is now available in colour.21 Dec 2024Natural wondersWhat meteor showers signified in ancient ChinaStargazers are preparing for the next meteor shower but in ancient China, they were more than a stunning display.10 Nov 2024Natural wondersSouth African Braai: What it is and why you should try itThe Braai tradition in South Africa is more than just a BBQ, it's a phenomenon that ties the nation together.24 Sep 2024World's TableThe evolution of London's oldest 'ocakbaşı' restaurantMangal 2, a fixture on the London food scene, is redefining Turkish cuisine in a city constantly evolving.31 Aug 2024World's TableWould you eat a meal dreamed up by a computer?AI v The Mind: We explore the world of food and ask if human expertise is the only way to deliver great flavour.23 Aug 2024InnovationTurkey's wild and rugged Black Sea regionFood writer Nick Kwek finds out how the wild landscape of Turkey's Black Sea region influences local cuisine.1 Aug 2024Food & DrinkClimate chaos makes Paddington Bear 'hangry'Drought forces the real Paddington Bear into deadly conflict with cattle farmers in the Andes.21 Jul 2024Natural wondersSemma: A rare taste of South India in ManhattanAt Michelin-starred Semma, chef Vijay Kumar brings deeply personal dishes from his childhood to the plate.6 Jul 2024World's TableSushi master brings authentic Japanese techniques to NYCAt Icca, Japanese sushi master chef Kazushige Suzuki blends ancient methods with other cuisines.8 Jun 2024World's TableWhat's it like to camp in Antarctica?Marc Cieslak spends a night on ice, camping under the stars.24 May 2024Natural wondersNasa reveals giant lava lake on Jupiter's volcanic moonNew research suggests the fiery moon Io has been spewing lava for billions of years.24 Apr 2024Natural wondersWorld's first 'zero-waste' restaurant without a single binAs part of its mission, Silo uses a nose to tail and root to tip approach to cooking out of respect for nature.21 Apr 2024World's TableListen to world's first 'chat' between humans and whalesScientists had a conversation with Twain, the humpback whale.
