Focusing on simple ingredients and treating food as a way to bring friends and family together, he's become a renowned chef, a best-selling author and a touchstone for home cooks looking to incorporate global flavours into their everyday rotations.The chef, father and former philosophy student explains to BBC special correspondent Katty Kay, in her interview series Influential, that having parents who cooked helped shape his path. However, he says that it was the sense of belonging that came with cooking – not family expectations – that truly drew him in."There was a quiet expectation that I would probably become an academic," he says. "I don't remember having a conversation, which must have happened. 'What do you want to be when you grow up?' I don't remember that."His parents were both in education – his father, Michael, was a chemistry professor at Jerusalem's Hebrew University – but Ottolenghi notes that his folks both had experience in the kitchen.Natassja EbertOttolenghi became a household name after the opening of his restaurant in Notting Hill (Credit: Natassja Ebert)"Food was very important. We had good ingredients, good cooking. Both my parents were good cooks," he says. "My father used to cook a lot because he worked more flexible hours. My mother was a head teacher at school [...] She also cooked but he cooked even more."The 56-year-old chef – who has authored 11 cookbooks – tells Kay that rather than having an epiphany about his future path, he saw the kitchen as a space for curiosity and play, something that he's now passed onto his own children."My kids – I've got a 9 year old [and an] 11 year old – they play, you know?" he says. "They go in the kitchen and they make an omelette and this and that. I call it cooking as play. So, I used to do a bit of that but I wasn't obsessive about cooking."Food should be healing rather than routine, says OttolenghiBefore making his name in the culinary world, Ottolenghi dabbled in philosophy but found the subject matter too isolating and "esoteric"."The conversation was being held amongst a group of, like, four people, you know like groundbreaking stuff but actually nobody was participating," he said of his time in university, where he tackled topics like the meaning of photography and what images mean to their viewers. Instead of that very specialised field, he turned his focus to something simpler, literally.Natassja EbertOttolenghi says his approach to cooking has changed as he's seen the public's shifting attitudes to food (Credit: Natassja Ebert)In 2018, following the success of his eponymous Notting Hill café and shop, Ottolenghi published his fifth cookbook, Simple, distilling all the techniques and preparations that he'd become known for into something accessible and approachable."Food is a language that everybody understands," he says. What surprised him about that, however, was that the books started to eclipse the food. "Rather than just being a book to sell and share, the publishing arm of Ottolenghi became the dog wagging the tail in this respect. The books became the main thing, almost."Where to find Influential with Katty KayWatch Influential with Katty Kay live on Fridays at 21:30 ET on the BBC News channel or stream the full episode on YouTube.The books were a way for fans of the restaurant and of Ottolenghi's pared-down, flavour-forward recipes to access that world at home. He tells Kay that he hopes to be part of a movement to take cooking from being a chore into something healing and restorative."Home-style cooking and family-style serving are way more popular now than they used to be. I really put that down to, first of all, cost of living, but also Covid. In that moment, we understood that actually food should be healing rather than just one of all other activities that we do all day long that push us."More like this:• Misty Copeland is 'not scared' to face a career beyond dance• Ina Garten on her internet appeal: 'Young people don't have mom in the kitchen'• Entrepreneur Jane Wurwand on why 'high-touch will overshadow high-tech' in businessFans soon saw the changes in his books, shifting from the exact recipes served at his restaurants to something less haute cuisine and more streamlined, boasting titles like Simple, Plenty and his latest, Comfort."I think since Simple, I have been spending more of my time thinking, 'What does it actually mean to cook this recipe?' You know, 'When do I cook – when does one cook it? How much effort goes into it?'" he says. "Funnily, from a grand old age talking to younger chefs, I say to them, 'Is someone actually going to cook this?' I want people to cook my food."That pared-down approach has even turned "Ottolenghi" into an adjective – used to describe food that offers high impact with few ingredients and straightforward techniques. He remains humble, brushing off the distinction and putting the focus back on his desire to make cooking comforting."Food really is one of those activities that shouldn't induce anxiety. It's as simple as that," he says.-- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. For more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram. Influential with Katty KayWorld's TableFood & DrinkFeaturesWatchInside one of the world's most remote restaurants'Off-Map Destination' winner Wolfgat offers a menu made from hyper-local and foraged ingredients.11 Apr 2025World's TableSouth African Braai: What it is and why you should try itThe Braai tradition in South Africa is more than just a BBQ, it's a phenomenon that ties the nation together.24 Sep 2024World's TableThe evolution of London's oldest 'ocakbaşı' restaurantMangal 2, a fixture on the London food scene, is redefining Turkish cuisine in a city constantly evolving.31 Aug 2024World's TableWould you eat a meal dreamed up by a computer?AI v The Mind: We explore the world of food and ask if human expertise is the only way to deliver great flavour.23 Aug 2024InnovationTurkey's wild and rugged Black Sea regionFood writer Nick Kwek finds out how the wild landscape of Turkey's Black Sea region influences local cuisine.1 Aug 2024Food & DrinkSemma: A rare taste of South India in ManhattanAt Michelin-starred Semma, chef Vijay Kumar brings deeply personal dishes from his childhood to the plate.6 Jul 2024World's TableSushi master brings authentic Japanese techniques to NYCAt Icca, Japanese sushi master chef Kazushige Suzuki blends ancient methods with other cuisines.8 Jun 2024World's TableWorld's first 'zero-waste' restaurant without a single binAs part of its mission, Silo uses a nose to tail and root to tip approach to cooking out of respect for nature.21 Apr 2024World's TableSweden's Icehotel: The menu inspired by eight Sami seasonsThe menu at the Icehotel, the world's first hotel made out of ice and snow, is served on plates of ice.14 Apr 2024World's TableThe blunder that changed chickens foreverHow this one simple mistake gave birth to the 50-billion-dollar US chicken industry.25 Mar 2024Food & DrinkInside the only all-female Indian kitchen in the worldLondon's Darjeeling Express is ground zero for chef Asma Khan, a champion of women's empowerment.9 Mar 2024World's TableInto the wild: 'Everyman's right' to forage in FinlandForaging is one of Finland's favourite hobbies and an essential part of the culture.4 Mar 2024World's TableA unique experience in the heart of a Norwegian fjordFloating in the middle of a Norwegian fjord, Restaurant Iris takes diners on an 'experiential dining' journey.17 Feb 2024World's TableThe mixologist serving up Black History one drink at a timeDeniseea Taylor is a mixologist who teaches what she jokingly calls 'drunk Black History'.17 Feb 2024World's TableThe first two-Michelin-star Chinese restaurant outside AsiaTaste of China: How chef Andrew Wong takes diners on a culinary journey across China's provinces.10 Feb 2024World's TableThe hunt for the world's most expensive fungusReel takes you to Italy to explore how the world's rarest and most expensive ingredient ends up on our tables.4 Jan 2024Food & DrinkWhat food and drink is good for your memory?What we eat, it turns out, can have an impact on how well our memory works.2 Jan 2024Food & DrinkBritish v American scones: Is there a difference?American baker and chef Nancy Silverton explains the difference between British and American scones.24 Dec 2023World's TableHow safe is frozen fruit?A huge recall of frozen fruits is currently happening across the US due to contamination fears. 21 Dec 2023Food & DrinkFire, smoke, and ash are all ingredients in Bottura's BBQInside the kitchen of Italian chef Massimo Bottura's new restaurant Al Gatto Verde.20 Nov 2023World's TableMore31 mins agoAldrich Ames: The US's most damaging double agentThe CIA officer spent nearly a decade selling secrets to the Soviet Union, leading to the deaths of at least 10 Western agents.
