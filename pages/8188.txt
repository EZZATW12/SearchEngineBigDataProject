Hillfield Animal Home in Stretton, on the outskirts of Burton upon Trent, serves as Burton's RSPCA branch, but while it falls under the organisation's "family umbrella", the branch is a separate charity and needs to be self-sufficient to continue its work, the RSPCA states.  The branch says the financial situation is "critical", posing risk of closure. The centre currently cares for nearly 50 cats, 20 dogs, nine rabbits and a guinea pig, all in need of permanent homes.  Arthur Ashton from the Burton branch said the centre faced a "worrying time".RSPCANero has been at the centre for 188 days"Unfortunately our financial situation is now critical and without immediate support, we could be forced to close our doors," Mr Ashton said."With the rise of expenditure with staffing and vet bills, we are also seeing a decline in donations and income from our shops. "Vet bills on average alone are more than £7,200 a month."RSPCABella, eight, is still looking for her forever homeA fundraising page for the "Save Our Animal Home" appeal has currently generated more than £7,000 for the cause.Animals in the centre's care had been rescued from neglect and cruelty, the branch said.Among them is eight-year-old cat Bella who has been with the branch for 104 days, while American bulldog cross Nero, who is four years old, has been at Hillfield for 188 days.Homes are also being sought for three pairs of rabbits who are also classed as "long stays".Georgia Coxon from RSPCA Burton upon Trent & District Branch said: "If you are looking to take on a pet, please consider adopting rather than buying. "We have so many rescued pets looking for their second chance of happiness."Follow BBC Stoke & Staffordshire on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.Related internet linksRSPCABurton-upon-TrentRSPCAStrettonAnimalsAnimal welfareRelatedMan charged with murder over 2015 crash6 days agoStoke & StaffordshireMan murdered father and hid body in cardboard box15 Apr 2025Stoke & StaffordshireSonic Boom Festival headline acts announced 12 Apr 2025Stoke & StaffordshireMore22 mins agoNorman the donkey encourages people to litter pickA donkey is helping to encourage people to take part in a community litter pick.22 mins agoWiltshire5 hrs agoAnimal rescue centre searches for new homeSafe Haven Animal Rescue in Knockholt cares for about twenty horses, pigs, sheep, chickens and cats.5 hrs agoKent2 days agoDog found using owner's t-shirt after 529 days in Australian wildernessValerie survived intense heat and avoided venomous snakes during her time lost in the wilderness.2 days agoAustralia2 days agoPregnant kitten found abandoned in plastic boxThe two kittens, named April and Sgt Major by staff, were found in an orchard field in Canterbury.2 days agoKent3 days agoBirds killed in second suspected catapult attackThe RSPCA says Kent has become a hotspot for weapon attacks on animals.3 days agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.
