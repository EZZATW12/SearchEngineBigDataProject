That would mean Ancelotti leaving Real before this summer's Club World Cup in the United States.Ancelotti is the number one choice to replace Dorival Junior, who was sacked after Brazil's 4-1 defeat by old rivals Argentina in Buenos Aires last month.Brazil are fourth in the South American World Cup qualification table. While they are not in any danger of failing to qualify for the expanded 48-team tournament to be jointly held in the United States, Canada and Mexico next year, the CBF feels Ancelotti would give Brazil the best chance of winning it.The CBF previously wanted to appoint Ancelotti for last summer's Copa America but failed in its pursuit.Ancelotti has won two La Liga and three Champions League titles across two spells at Real, including both trophies last season.However, his side are four points behind La Liga leaders Barcelona with five matches remaining and were beaten 5-1 on aggregate by Arsenal in the Champions League quarter-finals.Bayer Leverkusen's Xabi Alonso is reportedly a candidate to replace Ancelotti at the Bernabeu.Related topicsBrazilReal MadridFootballBrazil sack boss Dorival after Argentina defeatPublished28 MarchWhat's going on with Brazil?Published26 March'Stress is fuel' - Ancelotti plays down Real pressure Published5 days agoMore on this storyListen to the latest Football Daily podcastGet football news sent straight to your phonePublished31 JanuaryTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8672 viewing8.7k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published13 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
