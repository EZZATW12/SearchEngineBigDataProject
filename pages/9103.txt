Pym parried his powerful header but only to Willumsson who converted from seven yards.The hosts increased their lead five minutes after the break when Dowell headed Paik Seung-ho's left-wing cross firmly home and seven minutes later it was 4-0 as Dowell's impudent back-heel freed Iwata to stroke home.Match report supplied by PA Media.
