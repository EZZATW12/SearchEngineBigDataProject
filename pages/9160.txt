Game over."United need more than a miracle," Rio Ferdinand said on TNT Sports commentary.Then the miracle unfolded.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, With 11 minutes left, it looked more likely that Lyon would score again than United would produce a comebackBut as the famous song goes, Man Utd will never die.Bruno Fernandes, perhaps the only United player to have done himself justice this season, pulled one back from the penalty spot after Casemiro was kicked during a frantic scrabble. Six minutes remaining.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Bruno Fernandes converted his penalty before grabbing the ball and rushing back to the centre circle for the restartIn the 120th minute, substitute Kobbie Mainoo cut inside his man and bent a stunning, curling strike into the bottom far corner.It's been a difficult campaign for the young England midfielder after shooting to stardom last season, but this was a moment befitting of his quality.All square on the night and on aggregate. Penalties looming, six weeks after suffering shootout elimination in the FA Cup.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Mainoo's second goal in all competitions this season will be long rememberedNot today said Harry Maguire, the ultimate scapegoat figure of United's steady decline who continues to step up in big moments.Less than a minute after Mainoo struck, Maguire was wheeling away in delerious celebration after heading in the winner. Bedlam."I've never seen anything like that as a spectator. It was an amazing thing. We saw so many fans leaving when it was 4-2 and you thought that was over," former United defender Rio Ferdinand said on TNT Sports."I said on commentary it would take more than a miracle to get back into it and now I'm actually a believer because that was outrageous."Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Maguire rose to score on 120+1 minutes, just a minute after MainooImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Maguire's winning goal caused chaos at Old Trafford'I have seen nothing like it'Former England goalkeeper Paul Robinson was similarly gobsmacked on BBC Radio 5 Live."The scenes inside Old Trafford are something else," he said."I have seen nothing like it. Bedlam. The stewards are on the pitch, fans are on the pitch and staff are on the pitch. Andre Onana is doing laps of celebrations. Old Trafford has not seen scenes like this for many a year."I don't think I have ever seen a game like that. They looked dead and buried. I have not seen that character from them all season."Superlatives, you run out of them."Never before have five goals been scored during a period of extra time in a European knockout fixture.United's comeback was as ludicrous as it was improbable, but when the Theatre of Dreams is concerned, strange things have been known to happen."You've seen special things happen at this club. I think back to the Ole Gunnar Solskjaer against Liverpool [in 1999]. It reminded me slightly, I know that's only 2-1 and this was 5-4," said former United midfielder Paul Scholes on TNT Sports."I always feel like when you get one here you've got a chance."Perhaps United defender Leny Yoro summed it up best."Honestly, I don't understand what's happened. It was crazy! The fans helped us to do it. When you hear the fans, even at 4-2 you know we can do it," he told TNT Sports."We needed to believe and if you don't believe you cannot win. This is what the fans deserve - they give everything at every game."United are 14th in the Premier League and will finish the season with their lowest-ever Premier League points tally.But now they have something to play for. Get past Athletic Bilbao in the semi-finals next month, and they will contest the final at Bilbao's San Mames.Win that and they will play in the Champions League next season.Fans won't be thinking about that though - they'll be reliving the scenes at Old Trafford on Thursday for years to come.Related topicsManchester UnitedEuropa LeagueFootballManchester United drag their season out of the ashes - read Simon Stone's report of the pandemonium at Old TraffordAmorim 'inspired' by 1999 for United comeback Published18 April'Three games from glory, Man Utd begin to show never-say-die DNA'Published18 AprilMore on this storyLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan viewsGet Man Utd news notificationsPublished26 July 2022Comments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 246Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8712 viewing8.7k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published13 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
