At the same time, we can only do what we can do and we need to start winning football matches."You do not have to delve too deeply into the numbers to see the bother they are in.Six points adrift at the foot of the table, they have just four games remaining, with the next of those at home to Kilmarnock on Saturday (15:00 BST).Has damage already been done?St Johnstone's plight is stark – but how has a club that has for so long been part of the Premiership furniture got into such trouble?Valakari was appointed in October with the side sitting 10th.While they have gone backwards in terms of league position since, the Finn has been praised for trying to produce a team playing better football.It has taken a while for that to be reflected in an upturn of results, though they did beat champions Celtic and reach the Scottish Cup semi-finals.So, has the damage already been done in terms of their top-flight status?Arithmetically, of course, they can still turn things around but they need to do their bit and hope others falter.Struggling St Johnstone six adrift after losing at MotherwellVisit our St Johnstone page for all the latest news, analysis and fan viewsGet St Johnstone news notifications in the BBC Sport appPublished18 June 2023From 'most stable' to 'most unstable'While the finger is usually pointed at the manager – and he does have to shoulder some blame - you also must bear in mind that Valakari was brought in with the summer transfer window long since closed.The Finn has largely had to work with what was already there and, while he was able to make some changes to his squad in January, turning around a ship that was already heading for choppy waters in a short period of time is a tall order.Are the factors that have led to St Johnstone's plight more deep rooted? Former midfielder Murray Davidson, who spent 14 years at McDiarmid Park, believes "it has been building for years".St Johnstone had been a picture of consistency since returning to the top division under Derek McInnes in 2009, but Davidson says they went from being "the most stable club" to being the "most unstable" in Scottish football by the time he retired in the summer of 2023.Highlights: Motherwell 3-2 St Johnstone26/04/25Watch on iPlayerTommy Wright presided over a seven-year spell during which he led the side to their first Scottish Cup win in 2014, as well as European campaigns and top-six finishes.Those foundations were initially built on by assistant and successor Callum Davidson, who oversaw a remarkable domestic cup double in season 2020-21.However, such stability has been lacking of late and has coincided with a downturn in fortunes.Following Davidson's near three-year spell, the club appointed another rookie boss - former striker Steven MacLean, who lasted just seven months.St Johnstone then turned to veteran Craig Levein, who was in the post for 10 months before being replaced by Valakari in October, becoming their fourth manager in 19 months.Regularly changing managers, all with their own ideas and the inevitable churn of players that comes with that, rarely delivers success."There were players signed who were nowhere near good enough," Davidson tells BBC Scotland. "And when we signed players that weren't good enough, the next window it was, 'we need to sign four or five players'. It was a snowball effect for five or six windows."Change in ownership and 'panic buys'This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, 'From most stable club in Scotland to most unstable'Overly nearly four decades, St Johnstone were transformed under the ownership of Geoff Brown.Davidson says the businessman and his son Steve, who succeeded his father as chairman, "were unbelievable for me and for St Johnstone".He suggests "there was a core of 13, 14, 15 players" and they only needed to add three or four each season to ensure continuity."They weren't the biggest-paying club, and we weren't going to get the ball and play 30 passes, but everybody bought into what was successful and what it meant to people," Davidson said."Towards the end of my career, that wasn't happening. You were going in, there were two or three of us left, there were people coming in who didn't know the league, didn't know what the club was about."Having announced in December 2022 that he was selling the club, it was not until summer 2024 that American businessman Adam Webb took over from Brown.There will inevitably have been a period of uncertainty in the intervening 18 months – and uncertainty rarely creates an environment conducive to success."The last eight, nine, 10 windows, they have had to panic buy," Davidson adds.Now the club great hopes they can return to the stability and success of the not too distant past.With relatively new owners at the helm and with a manager who wants to try to play the right way, the future could still be bright for the McDiarmid Park club.However, a lot of that may depend on whether Valakari and his players can produce a Houdini-style Premiership survival act over the coming weeks.Related topicsScottish PremiershipSt JohnstoneScottish FootballFootballTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8775 viewing8.8k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published13 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Scottish sportWhat is still to be decided as season reaches climax?League reconstruction - why, when & what might it look like?Scotland men's internationals to be shown live on BBCCommonwealth Games: Why is it so special to be part of Team Scotland?From titles to tinpottery - rank Scotland's top 10 clubsElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
