Chelsea second best by some distanceChelsea boss Sonia Bompastor was brought in on a four-year contract last May to win the Champions League, the one trophy that eluded former boss Emma Hayes.The Blues, who have already won the Women's League Cup this season, need just four points to confirm another WSL title, while they face Manchester United in the Women's FA Cup final at Wembley on 18 May.Yet European club football's biggest prize feels as distant as ever after two games where Barca exposed the gulf in class between the two sides. Bompastor, a two-time Champions League winner as a player who led Lyon to European success in 2022, wrote in her programme notes about putting on a performance for the fans after the first-leg mauling and giving it their all.Chelsea huffed and puffed but Barca were too good, too clinical, too clever.Losing to Barca has become a familiar tale for Chelsea, who have now gone out to the team from Catalonia at the semi-final stage for the third successive season.At least last season they won 1-0 in Spain before losing 2-0 in front of their own fans. This time they were hammered by Barcelona over 180 minutes.Smart, intelligent, ruthless - Barca look unstoppableDespite losing to Manchester City in their opening Champions League group game this season, Barcelona stand on the cusp of greatness.Barca were everything you expect from a team hunting down a fourth Champions League triumph in five seasons.Smart, intelligent, ruthless - and they showed no mercy against the best team in England.This hugely talented side packed with World Cup and multiple Champions League winners - as well as Women's Ballon d'Or winners - look unstoppable.They have rattled up 44 goals in 10 games in Europe this season - including one from England midfielder Keira Walsh before she moved to Chelsea in January.Barca have scored three or more goals in nine of their 10 games in Europe.The Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.
