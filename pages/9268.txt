Suyash Sharma was particularly economical, going wicketless in his four overs but only conceding 22 runs, while Bhuvneshwar Kumar took 3-33.KL Rahul was the pick of the Delhi batters with 41 from 39 balls.Royal Challengers are now two points ahead of Gujarat Titans at the top, albeit having played two games more. Delhi Capitals are two points behind in fourth.Related topicsEngland Men's Cricket TeamCricketMore on this storyNotifications, social media and more with BBC SportPublished31 JanuaryTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions7851 viewing7.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published13 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
