Surrey knocked off their target of 36 in 5.2 overs and moved up to second in the table. behind early leaders Nottinghamshire.At one stage Somerset lost six wickets for 13 runs in eight overs and were 38-7 after Clark and Worrall proved too good with a new ball that swung nicely.Somerset, winless after four games, were complicit in their own downfall with some soft dismissals in the post-lunch period when five wickets went down in 34 balls for just four runs. Migael Pretorious held up Surrey with 54 but it was only delaying the inevitable.Somerset had dismissed Surrey for 367 an hour into the third day but were soon in trouble. They lost Archie Vaughan to the sixth ball of the innings thanks to a fine catch by wicketkeeper Ben Foakes, who dived full length when Vaughan leg-glanced Worrall.With Sean Dickson unable to bat because of a broken finger, Josh Davey came in at three and he and Tom Lammonby did well to get through the rest of Worrall's skilful five-over opening spell. Davey, who batted at 10 in the first innings, appeared to relish the extra responsibility when he took two boundaries off Gus Atkinson in an over with a straight drive and sweetly timed clip through mid-wicket.But the stand was broken in off-spinner Dan Lawrence's first over when he skidded his fifth ball into Lammonby's pads. Surrey sensed blood, and they ran through Somerset in a remarkable period after lunch.Tom Abell clipped the first ball of the session from Jordan Clark off middle stump to fine leg for four but shouldered arms to the next delivery and lost his off stump. Davey (17) unluckily played on two balls later and in the next over Dan Worrall dived low to his left to intercept a full-blooded drive by Tom Banton in his follow through which was followed by an elaborate celebration.It got worse for Somerset. They were 38-6 in the 18th over after Kasey Aldridge's attempted pull at Clark cannoned off the bottom edge into his stumps. Worrall struck again in his next over when James Rew's clip off his pads was caught by the diving Lawrence at backward square leg to leave Somerset staring down the barrel at 38-7.Pretorious kept them waiting with an attacking 54 off 45 balls, including eight fours, as he and skipper Lewis Gregory put on 79 for the eighth wicket and it took a fine one-handed catch by Foakes to break the stand and give James Taylor a deserved wicket. Taylor finished the innings when he had Jack Leach caught at slip.Dom Sibley was caught at square leg and Ollie Pope played across a straight ball from Davey before Jamie Smith hit the winning boundary to mid-wicket. Victory lifted them into second place behind Nottinghamshire, who also enjoyed a three-day victory, over Sussex.At the start of the day, Surrey's final three wickets added a further 46 runs. Lawrence followed up his 117 against Sussex last week with an unbeaten 55 off 74 balls with seven fours as Pretorious, Davey and Aldridge took a wicket apiece.ECB Reporter's Network supported by Rothesay.Related topicsSurreySomersetCricketMore on this storyNotifications, social media and more with BBC SportPublished31 JanuaryComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 105Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions7851 viewing7.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published13 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
