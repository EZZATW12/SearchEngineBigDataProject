Afghanistan leg-spinner Noor Ahmad and seamer Khaleel Ahmed have impressed but their only batter in the top 30 run-scorers is Shivam Dube, who was retained from 2024. "It's hard to say we got it completely right with the performances that we've had," said Fleming."We have been looking over that in detail, just around our style of play and also looking at how the game is evolving. "It is not easy, that is why we're proud of our record to date to be consistent for so long and it doesn't take much for it to go another way. Other teams have got better and that is the point of the auction but we just haven't been able to get it right. "That has to be an area where we need to reflect and say 'it hasn't been as good as it could have been' or it hasn't worked out how we wanted. "But, it is also not a perfect science, the auction is a very fluid beast. It is like buying 25 houses so you can come away from it mentally, and sometimes, physically exhausted."There's a lot of responsibility and soul-searching and that certainly starts at the top with me."Related topicsFranchise CricketCricketTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8705 viewing8.7k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published13 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
