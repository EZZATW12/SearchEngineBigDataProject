Durham faced a victory target of 107, no formality on such a pitch, but reached 108-4, thanks principally to Ben McKinney's 34 from 58 balls.After resuming on the second morning on 55-4, Durham hit immediate further turbulence with two wickets in the fourth over, from Taylor. Jack Blatherwick edged to wicketkeeper Gareth Roderick and Will Rhodes did the same to end 111 minutes of defiance for 17.Drissell and Graham Clark dug in to add 47 in 20 overs before Allison took three wickets in 13 balls. Clark played on, Raine edged to second slip and Drissell was taken at point, but number 11 Jake Ball made 13, a very handy cameo in the context of the match, before Yusuf edged Jacob Duffy behind.Worcestershire's second innings lurched straight into crisis as Raine struck three times in his first two overs. His third ball clipped Roderick's off-stump, his ninth went to second slip via Jake Libby's edge and his 11th pinned Rob Jones lbw. Six innings in this match brought Roderick, Libby and Jones a combined 18 runs.Henry Nicholls and Adam Hose chiselled out 40 but the most authoritative shot of the day, Hose's cut four off Ball, was immediately followed by his dismissal when he tickled the next ball behind.Taylor followed, dubiously adjudged lbw to Yusuf and when Kiwi debutant Nicholls fell lbw to Ball having gritted out 25 in 72 minutes, Worcestershire were 50-6.Yusuf hit Brett D'Oliveira's middle stump and, after Raine trapped Matthew Waite lbw, the South African finished off the innings with wickets in successive balls as Allison played on and Duffy skied a slog.Chasing 108 in two days and a session, Durham lost Alex Lees, bowled by Duffy, in the third over but McKinney and Will Rhodes added 35, almost a third of the target, before Rhodes edged an unplayable ball from Taylor.Colin Ackermann fell lbw to Waite but, with such a small target, Worcestershire's bowlers needed dot balls as well as wickets and they could not find enough. McKinney drove Waite to mid-off but Robinson and Clark saw their side home with an assertive unbroken stand of 36 in 41 balls. It was a match for batters to forget but the biggest losers were the Worcestershire fans, denied any cricket to watch on Sunday with the weather due to be glorious.ECB Reporters' Network supported by RothesayWorcestershire coach Alan Richardson:"At the start of the day it felt like we were in a really strong position. We battled really hard with the bat on the first day and showed a lot of application. Then we bowled really well as a unit to get a lead and we were pretty hopeful from there but the momentum just went from us."We didn't handle the third innings of the game very well at all. If you have a session like that you are not going to win many games of cricket. "It is disappointing to have lost two games after taking a first innings lead but it would be more of a concern if we were never in the games. "We are putting ourselves into strong positions, it's just a question of working out how to make sure we drive those positions home."Durham captain Alex Lees:"We are delighted with the win. The obvious talking point is the wicket, to have 34 wickets in just over 180 overs is not what everyone had on their radar at the start of the week, so we are delighted to be on the right side of it."The guys bowled incredibly in the third innings of the game after we had done well to get close to them with the bat this morning. "George Drissell is a quality batter and his knock this morning was a match-winning innings in the context of the game. The game ebbed and flowed across the two days but little contributions like that are absolutely crucial."It is a great to have a couple of bonus days off. We have got 10 injuries in this first block of games so to have some extra time to recover is amazing. In this game we had 12 fit players to pick from."Related topicsDurhamWorcestershireCricketMore on this storyNotifications, social media and more with BBC SportPublished31 JanuaryComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 98Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8705 viewing8.7k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published13 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
