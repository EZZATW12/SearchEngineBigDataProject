It came as complete surprise to us."An FIA spokesperson said: "Any FIA full member may decide to support a candidate and make him their representative."MotorsportUK chairman David Richards has recently been critical of Ben Sulayem's actions, saying he has had a "shift of moral compass".Richards is among a series of critics who have described what they say is the erosion of accountability within the FIA and concentration of power in the president's hands.In the wake of Reid's resignation, the former FIA chief executive officer Natalie Robyn broke her silence over having left the organisation after just 18 months in the role last summer.Robyn told BBC Sport she had "worked under challenging circumstances to strengthen the federation's governance framework and upgrade its operational transparency".She said Reid's departure "clearly indicates there are serious ongoing structural challenges", adding: "When professional processes are not adhered to and stakeholders are excluded from decision-making, it undermines the foundation of a strong organisation."Ben Sulayem said of Wilson in an FIA statement: "Malcolm has had a distinguished career in global motorsport."For over 40 years he has competed at the highest level both as a driver and technical partner to teams."This experience will be invaluable to the FIA and our member clubs as we continue to grow grassroots and professional motorsport, driving innovation in the sport to benefit fans, drivers and teams."Wilson was quoted in a statement saying that it was a "great honour" to be nominated for the role.Wilson added: "I very much look forward to supporting the president and all the FIA family in its important mission."There has never been a more exciting time to be in motorsport and I know first-hand the benefits the sport brings to families and communities across the world."I look forward to working with the president for the duration of his current term of office, bringing our sport to new audiences and ensuring we deliver the very best championships for all our competitors."Ben Sulayem's first term as president expires in December. No-one has yet come forward to oppose the Emirati.Related topicsMotorsportFormula 1Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8413 viewing8.4k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published13 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
