Although the Australian was quicker in both the second and third sectors, the Dutchman had done enough to grab pole.Verstappen said: "I definitely didn't expect to be on pole here but the car came alive in the night and it was a lot more enjoyable to drive. The grip was coming to me. Around here a qualifying lap is extremely difficult. It is really satisfying."Tomorrow in the race it will be tough to keep them behind but we are going to give it a good go."Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Norris did not want to speak about his crash in interviews after qualifyingPiastri said: "Max has done a good job, another high-speed circuit for them, where they seem to have a little more success. Our pace is good. It's going to be a tough race, the tyres are softer than last year and we'll see if that plays to our advantage."Norris will have to rely on the strong race pace of the McLaren to try to limit the damage to his championship position, as he starts the race three points clear of Piastri and eight in front of Verstappen.His accident was caused by him misjudging the entry to the chicane at Turns Four and Five. The car oversteered on to the kerb at Five and was flicked into the wall on the exit, damaging the left-hand side of the car.He swore over the radio that he was an "idiot", but was unhurt."Disappointed but I'm fine," Norris said. "The team have a lot of work to do. It has been such a smooth positive weekend so far, so I'm disappointed to have such big setback. But have to take it on the chin, and try and go again tomorrow."The car is quick. It has been quick all weekend, so I have to work hard to overtake the cars tomorrow."Russell said he had "mixed feelings" because he felt there was more in his car, adding that he rued Mercedes' decision not to use the same strategy as Red Bull after the red flag.At Ferrari, Hamilton's travails this season continued, underlined by the statistic that he has only once so far qualified higher than the seventh place he managed this weekend."I've been nowhere all weekend," Hamilton said. "I am happier than I was yesterday. It really wasn't coming easy, so P7 is OK. I still have work to do to try to gel with this car."Related topicsFormula 1Comments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 928Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9591 viewing9.6k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published13 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
