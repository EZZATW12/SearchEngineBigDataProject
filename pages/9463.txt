"But that is a thing of the past. We don't assign to that. We must be as safe as possible."Every accident we examine in a lot of detail - what trajectory the car followed during the crash; what the reason was for it - there's usually a lot of factors."All of that goes in to learning how to improve the cars, the track, procedures… everything is analysed in excruciating detail by the safety department. There are always incremental changes."Following Senna's death, several safety changes were made, including the introduction of accident data recorders in cars, higher cockpit sides and wheel tethers to aid head protection.As part of new F1 regulations for 2026, the cars will be more resistant to front and side impacts."The nose of the car will be able to absorb a large amount of longitudinal energy," says Tombazis, "whilst having construction which will make sure if it hits the wall laterally, only part [of it] breaks off and another part remains for the subsequent impact."Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Romain Grosjean's car was stuck inside the metal barrier after his crash in Bahrain The halo - a higher powerSome of the new elements introduced for 2026 are developments prompted by a crash for Romain Grosjean at the 2020 Bahrain Grand Prix which even Hollywood couldn't have dreamt up.On the first lap, Grosjean made contact with Daniil Kyvat's Alpha Tauri, which pitched his Haas into a barrier at high speed, exploding on impact as the car became wedged between the metal bars of the barriers which flank a large part of every Formula 1 circuit.It was the type of crash the sport hadn't witnessed for decades, and one which frequently led to fatalities in the past.Little has ever looked more gladiatorial than Grosjean rising from a huge ball of flames after squeezing between charred and twisted steel and striding across to a waiting ambulance, received by disbelieving marshals and medical staff."The engine split from the chassis," says Tombazis, "which is OK as such, but in splitting it ripped the chassis apart, and so it left the fuel tank exposed, thus fuel came out and it caused a fireball."We were very fortunate the driver was conscious and therefore could come out."Tombazis then explained how the post-crash analysis process worked."Every car has an electronic box which logs a lot of signals," he says."It logs all the G-[force] loads of the car, therefore it's possible to calculate the trajectory of car as it was out of control and how quickly it decelerated and how hard it hit the barrier, and how it came to rest."This data gets analysed. In addition, the remains of the car, the chassis, gets analysed."Some of the subsequent analysis we did, we worked on how the engine would come off the chassis and applied further regulation to ensure that when the engine rips off, the failure points are bolts connecting the engine to the chassis and not the chassis itself."So now if things go as planned in similar circumstances, maybe the engine comes apart, but the chassis remains intact and the fuel tank also. So that's one outcome of that accident."Grosjean, who now races for Lamborghini in the United States, credits the 'halo' head protection device for saving his life, after the structure around the cockpit helped to create enough space in the barrier for the Frenchman to escape."Without it, I wouldn't be able to speak with you today," said Grosjean after the crash.There have been several clear instances where serious injury has been averted thanks to the halo and other innovations across the sport.F1's current quickest man - McLaren's Lando Norris - agrees, highlighting the crash between Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen at the 2021 Italian Grand Prix."It can hold a number of double decker buses without breaking," he says. "Given the speed we do, it can deflect an enormous about of things.“We saw with Lewis and Max, where Max's car ended on top of Lewis. If [the halo] was not there it would have been on Lewis' head - you never want to know what the consequences might have been if we didn’t have the halo."Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Max Vertsappen's crash with Lewis Hamilton at the Italian GP in 2021 was one of the clearest incidents yet in which the halo prevented injuryHow 'active safety' can be prevention Norris believes safety in F1 is "improving all the time"."You want an element of fear, it's what makes a racing driver - the barrier being one metre away at 200mph - but you never want something to go wrong," he says."When I sign up for going out and risking my life, I do that knowing what the consequences can be."The innovations using carbon fibre construction techniques and advancements of other materials are impressive.But according to Tombazis, future safety solutions could be more about prediction rather than projectiles. Including the use of artificial intelligence."We believe the best safety improvements in the next 10 years, I suspect, will be more in active safety: how to prevent accidents in the first place, rather than deal with what happens after an impact."How to prevent crashes meaning how to give better warnings to drivers about something happening further ahead."Not without proper study, but maybe to look at how we automatically warn other drivers, or slowing down cars approaching an accident scene - these sort of things we believe will be fundamental."A lot of developments in the road industry, a lot of safety improvements, are related to, let's say, cars talking to each other - so there's a lot of elements there."AI will be a key part about active safety - how we interpret the unfolding events during a race, or at the start of an accident or give a quick reaction, that will involve aspects related to AI."In Bahrain four years ago, Grosjean said shortly after his crash: "I cannot die today - I want to see my kids."With ongoing innovation, and a little luck, tomorrow's consequences could be a lot less dramatic.Related topicsFormula 1More on this storyIs F1's cost cap leading to better racing?Published30 September 2024F1 in 10 Years: Norris says keeping 'sound and smell' is vitalPublished31 July 2024F1 in 10 Years: The Grand Prix BallPublished29 August 2024Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9582 viewing9.6k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published13 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
