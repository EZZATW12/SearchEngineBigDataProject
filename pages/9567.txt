Makazole Mapimpi, Vincent Tshituka and Jurenzo Julius all crossed as the Sharks drew level with 10 minutes to go before Hendrikse's late kick earned the Durban-based side a second away win in succession after also beating Edinburgh last weekend.While a win would have taken Ulster into seventh in the league standings, they instead remain in 12th place and are three points off the top eight.

Although the visitors still need results to be sure of their place in the top four, Ulster's need was greater, a reality reflected by the start made by Richie Murphy's side.Effectively moving the Sharks around the park, Ulster were finding plenty of space with Jacob Stockdale especially prominent early on.It was the Irish winger's break that created the opening score with flanker Cormac Izuchukwu keeping pace on his shoulder before offloading to Murphy in the corner.It was Stockdale's opposite wing, Zac Ward, who had the biggest hand in Ulster's second. The former sevens player raced on to a loose pass from the Sharks, hacked ahead, and then put Postlethwaite over.Stockdale was again the architect for Ulster's third, as he gathered his own chip and chase and provided a scoring pass for Doak. The scrum-half converted his own score but Ulster would not score again.While Stockdale was the star player of the opening 30 minutes, he would have to watch the conclusion of the half from the sidelines after being shown a yellow card for cynical play near his own line.To make matters worse for the hosts, the Sharks' Makazole Mapimpi scored while playing with the advantage.The Springboks winger thought he had reduced the deficit further before the break only to see his second effort ruled out for a forward pass in the build-up.Ulster survived the four minutes of the second half before Stockdale's return without further concession but were still having to do plenty of defending after being restored to 15 players.Prop Scott Wilson forced a Sharks' knock-on five metres from his own line and Rob Herring also produced strong work at a defensive breakdown to protect his side's lead. But after a period of real pressure, the Sharks did get their second on the hour mark when Vincent Tshituka crashed over after a succession of big carries. John Plumtree's side fumbled the restart to give Ulster their first spell in the Sharks' 22 of the second half but the attack was halted by a knock-on.Momentum had certainly shifted and, as Ulster's previously stout defence became more ragged, replacement full-back Jurenzo Julius burst through a gap to score under the posts.Jordan Hendrikse's subsequent conversion tied the game with just over 10 minutes remaining and the South Africa international made no mistake with his even later effort off the tee to secure the win.Ulster: Stockdale; Kok, Postlethwaite, McCloskey, Ward; Murphy, Doak; Warwick, Herring, Wilson, A O'Connor (capt), Izuchukwu, Matty Rea, Timoney, McNabney.
