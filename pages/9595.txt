Instead, they can focus on building a robust, sustainable, and commercially attractive sport that engages fans across the country."Such a radical change would require approval from the Rugby Football Union Council, whose 62 members represent the wider game, however the organisation's leadership is open to innovative ideas to grow the sport.Any move to a franchise model is unlikely to be implemented imminently though.Licences for a revamped Premiership, which could be time-limited, reviewed and potentially revoked, may be a route to gradually expanding the number of teams competing.The division consists of 10 clubs, but had plans to expand to 14 teams before Wasps, Worcester and London Irish went out of business.Promotion and relegation between the Premiership and Championship was paused in February 2021 because of uncertainty caused by the Covid pandemic.Although the link between the divisions was, in theory, restored this season, only Doncaster Knights were judged to have met the Premiership's minimum criteria around facilities and finances, with no other side eligible to contest a two-legged play-off against the top-flight's bottom side.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, A star-studded Saracens side, relegated the previous season for breaching the Premiership's salary cap, were the last team to be promoted from the second tier to the Premiership when they went up at the end of the 2020-21 seasonDoncaster, however, are sixth and out of the running for the Championship title.Leaders Ealing Trailfinders and fourth-placed Coventry – the other two clubs to apply to be assessed – were judged to lack sufficiently solid plans for expansion of their home grounds in an independent audit.Coventry chief executive Jon Sharp has said his club would be interested in the franchise route, , externalwhile expressing concerns that the model could shut out other sides with ambitions to compete at the highest level.Worcester, restored under new ownership, are set to return to an expanded Championship next season, while Wasps and London Irish also have aspirations to return to the top level after being bought out of administration.Multi-millionaire Craig bought Bath in 2010, but has only recently seen his heavy investment pay out in a sustained challenge at the top of the table.Last season, Bath lost out to Northampton in their first Premiership final appearance in nine years. They are 15 points clear at the top of this season's standings and into the European Challenge Cup semi-finals."This is not about self-interest," he added."It is an acceptance of the perilous state today of English club rugby. It is about aligning club rugby in this country with the world's strongest sports competitions, almost all of which use an expansion model rather than a system that deters investment through the constant threat of relegation."Related topicsRugby UnionBathMore on this storyListen: Sport's Strangest Crimes - BloodgateListen to the latest Rugby Union Weekly podcastComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 349Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8061 viewing8.1k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published13 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
