We are very excited to start our UK adventure, and we're looking forward to meeting all the loyal fans."Baxter said Ikitau was one of the "top centres" in world rugby. "He's playing very well, he's very keen to experience something else," Exeter director of rugby Rob Baxter told BBC Radio Devon."He's talked a lot with the Australians who have been here at Exeter, they've all said that if he gets over here and throws himself into it, then he'll have a great time, and that's very much what we want him to experience next season."Ikitau is set to make the move to Devon over the summer following the conclusion of the Super Rugby season and the British and Irish Lions' series against Australia - where he will be likely to play for the Wallabies.He also comes in to fill a gap in Exeter's midfield with Wales centre Joe Hawkins joining Scarlets when his contract expires at the end of the season.Ikitau is the third Australian international to sign for the Chiefs for next season, following hooker Julian Heaven and back row Tom Hooper. Baxter said he believed Ikitau could be a "special" player for the club."I'm very positive about the impact he can have, and our job is to create a team and an environment that lets all the individuals shine and what they're good at," Baxter said."And if we can do that with Len, we could see something very special."Exeter sign Australian hooker HeavenPublished3 AprilExeter Chiefs sign Wallabies back row HooperPublished14 JanuaryNeeded to 'move the team forward'Following two campaigns where Exeter have languished near the bottom of the table, rather than challenging at the top, Baxter said Ikitau's arrival represents how the club is growing again. He compared his arrival to that of scrum-half Nic White or former captain Dean Mumm in how they played a part in driving the team towards Premiership and European titles."To me this is part of us growing," Baxter said."They were there to drive us up the Premiership and make us competitive in Premiership top-end games, that's how I would view it [Ikitau's signing]."In the future he could be a signing that, once we're playing the right end, it's an additional signing that drives you over the edge, right here and now I think it's something we just need to keep moving the team forward."Related topicsExeter ChiefsRugby UnionTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions7951 viewing8k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published13 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
