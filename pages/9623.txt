As he came on to the pitch in the 50th minute of the tournament opener against Argentina, with his team trailing by six points, Youngs faced a formidable task.It was one he rose to.England rallied around Youngs' urgency as he upped the pace, tired out Argentina's ageing forwards and dragged his side back into the game.He sniped over for the decisive try and took a grip on the England nine shirt that lasted more than a decade.26 October 2019 - England 19-7 New Zealand Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, England were to go on to lose to South Africa in the final of the 2019 Rugby World CupBy the time of the 2019 tournament, Youngs' game, along with England's, had changed.Tempo came via sleight of hand, rather than fast feet.Youngs provided in spades as England swept past New Zealand via a blitzkrieg opening that delivered a try after just 90-odd seconds.He rolled back the years with a trademark close-range snipe, giving Anton Lienert-Brown the eyes and scampering in, only to see his second-half score chalked off for a small knock-on in the build-up.England were not to be derailed though, ascending to the high point of the Eddie Jones era.30 April 2022 - Leicester 56-26 BristolImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Ben (left) will join brother Tom in retirement at the end of the seasonFrom their family farm in Norfolk, Youngs has played alongside his older brother Tom in far further-flung fields, representing Tigers, Lions and their country together.Tom's own retirement came two years ago. He played only the pre-season of his final campaign, after being granted leave to care for his terminally ill wife Tiffany.After announcing he would hang up his boots, Tom was invited back into the dressing room for a final time to address the team before their match against Bristol.Ben, who had turned down a chance to tour with the Lions in 2017 to support Tom and Tiffany, started at scrum-half."I just talked about how I'd love to do one more tackle for them and one more carry for them but I can't," said Tom afterwards."I talked about Tiff a little bit. I talked about life, and how when you're in the moment, in that changing room, you don't realise how good it is and how lucky you are sometimes. Ultimately, you don't realise how cruel life can be sometimes, so you have to enjoy those moments."Leicester won 56-26.A couple of months later, Tom was invited back into the fold once more, lifting the Premiership title after Leicester's win over Saracens in the Premiership final at Twickenham.Related topicsRugby UnionLeicester TigersMore on this storyListen: Sport's Strangest Crimes - BloodgateListen to the latest Rugby Union Weekly podcastComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 89Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions7951 viewing8k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published13 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
