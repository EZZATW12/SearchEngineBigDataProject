He's someone I've known for a long time and I do feel like I can trust him. "For now there is no real thing set in stone but we're taking it week to week and he's helping me as much as he can alongside his current commitments."Why Raducanu opted for LA training blockPost-Miami, Raducanu decided it would be more beneficial to skip Great Britain's Billie Jean King Cup tie and do a short training block in the United States instead. The 2021 US Open champion spent the time in Los Angeles, where she worked with Petchey for 10 days before heading back to Europe.Raducanu, who has known Petchey since she was a teenager, says she is enjoying the "thought-provoking" nature of their conversations.Creating a relaxed atmosphere around her - which she said helped her "express" herself in Miami and be more "authentic" - is another hallmark of the partnership.Raducanu has also found greater equilibrium off the court. In LA, she enjoyed hiking trips in the mountains, while going to a post-training yoga class in Madrid is another example of her trying to strike a work-life balance."I'm happy with [the training block] and how I'm feeling on the court right now. I think I did some great work on my game and I'm looking forward to testing it on a match court," said British number two Raducanu.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Mark Petchey linked up with Raducanu in Miami, joining her long-time confidante Jane O'Donoghue in the support team"We created our own little bubble and it was nice to be working on my game out there but at the same time having fun and enjoying it."He's helped me in a lot of areas of my game and also off the court finding things to stimulate me mentally and constantly challenging me - which I like."Raducanu will return to the WTA Tour when she faces Suzan Lamens of the Netherlands in the Madrid first round later this week.It will be her first match since losing to American world number three Jessica Pegula in the Miami quarter-finals on 27 March."I had a long start to the year with many weeks in a row and I think my body and brain needed to have a little recharge," Raducanu said."With the transition to a different surface on clay, I feel I'm not at the point that I can switch surfaces in back-to-back weeks."Related topicsTennisMore on this storyLive scores, results and order of playGet tennis news sent straight to your phonePublished31 JanuaryTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8837 viewing8.8k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published13 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
