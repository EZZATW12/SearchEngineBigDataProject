Rune, 21, said."I kind of played it in my mind, the Olympic final, and I thought to myself let's try to play that kind of style, really make him play a lot of balls."I'm really happy about how I stayed composed when it really mattered. I was also very brave when it mattered."Alcaraz, who had been bidding for a third Barcelona title in four years, missed all four of the break opportunities he created in the second set and also required a medical timeout.While Rune will return to the top 10 on Monday, Alcaraz will be replaced as world number two by Alexander Zverev.Germany's Zverev beat Ben Shelton 6-2 6-4 in the Munich Open final to claim his first title of the year on his 28th birthday.Sabalenka beats Paolini to reach fourth Stuttgart finalPublished20 AprilZverev heckled again over domestic abuse allegationsPublished18 AprilFrench Open to honour Nadal at ceremonyPublished17 AprilThe first set in Barcelona was a high-quality encounter between two players born just six days apart and who have been playing one another since their teens.Alcaraz broke first, thumping his forehand with increasing ferocity, but Rune was equally impressive to immediately force the match back on serve.Both aggressive baseliners, Alcaraz and Rune sent the ball thudding around Pista Rafael Nadal, but Rune was superior at the net, winning 12 of 16 points there. Monte Carlo champion Alcaraz fended off four set points but a long forehand in the tie-break handed the initiative to Rune.Again, Alcaraz had his chances, missing two break points in Rune's first service game. But at 2-1 up, he left the court for a medical timeout, and could not find his rhythm on his return.Rune reeled off the next five games, committing 24 unforced errors to Alcaraz's 33, and ultimately secured victory on a missed Alcaraz forehand.The pair are set to play in the Madrid Masters, which begins on Tuesday.In the men's doubles final, Britain's Luke Johnson and Dutch partner Sander Arends triumphed 6-3 6-7 (1-7) 10-6 against Britis pair Joe Salisbury and Neal Skupski.Related topicsTennisMore on this storyLive scores, results and order of playGet tennis news sent straight to your phonePublished31 JanuaryTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9256 viewing9.3k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published13 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
