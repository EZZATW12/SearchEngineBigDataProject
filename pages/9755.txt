She smells really bad."But Dart later posted on her Instagram story: "I want to apologise for what I said on court today, it was a heat-of-the-moment comment that I truly regret."That's not how I want to carry myself, and I take full responsibility. I have a lot of respect for Lois and how she competed today."I'll learn from this and move forward."Boisson, who had walked back on to the court while Dart was still sat down, appeared to be out of earshot when the Briton made the comment to the umpire.However, she later made light of the incident on her Instagram story, posting an edited photo of her holding some deodorant and telling toiletries company Dove that they "apparently need a collab".Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Lois Boisson won her first WTA 125 title last yearBBC Sport has contacted the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) for comment.During the match, Dart failed to convert any of her six break points as the 21-year-old Boisson claimed a comprehensive victory to reach the last 16.Boisson, who is making her first WTA Tour appearance of the season after struggling with injury, is currently 303rd in the world rankings.She caused an upset by beating the 110th-ranked Dart, who lost her serve four times in the match.The Briton was appearing in her second clay-court match of the season before next month's French Open, having also lost to Varvara Gracheva last month in the first round at the Charleston Open.Related topicsTennisMore on this storyNorrie beaten in Barcelona, Alcaraz edges out QuinnPublished15 AprilCan Swiatek emulate Alcaraz to start clay season?Published14 AprilTop storiesLive. '100% better than last time' - Reaction as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions7767 viewing7.8k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published12 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published2 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign language'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
