A recent one is Nick Kyrgios, who reached the 2022 Wimbledon final. Never one to miss an opportunity to be provocative, the controversial Australian responded to Raducanu's run by calling coaches "overrated"."People awfully quiet that Raducanu is winning now - where all the experts at now?" Kyrgios posted on X.Raducanu seems committed to finding a new full-time coach - but the availability of suitable candidates is limited with a third of the season gone.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Mark Petchey has been working with Raducanu in Miami alongside her long-time confidante Jane O'DonoghueRaducanu's representatives describe Petchey - balancing the role in Miami with his work as a television commentator - as a "familiar face" who is providing "support".It is not clear, though, how long the arrangement will go on for.Former British number one Tim Henman, who has advised Raducanu over the years, believes Petchey's involvement "makes sense" given he knows "Emma's game"."It'll be interesting to see how long it lasts for," said Henman, who will return to the coaching box himself at this year's Laver Cup as a vice-captain."Emma has been fairly vocal that she is comfortable switching coaches - and that's her prerogative. "I started playing professional tennis at the end of 1992 and finished in 2007. I had three coaches. "I liked the consistency and continuity of working with a coach for a period of time. It was right for me but that doesn't mean it is right for Emma."Can Raducanu maintain 'competitive spirit'?Questions have regularly been raised about Raducanu's resilience, given the amount of injuries and issues she has dealt with since her US Open win.This season has also been challenging. A back injury disrupted her pre-season before a traumatic stalking experience in Dubai and then Cavaday's exit. The gritty manner in which she beat world number 10 Emma Navarro in the Miami second round answered some of the sceptics. She also showed steel to swat aside third-round opponent McCartney Kessler and Anisimova, who were both hampered physically.Raducanu feels she has rediscovered her "competitive spirit", conceding: "I think that's been missing in the last few months and even few years at times."Whatever she goes on to achieve in Florida, the next challenge is sustaining her level over a longer period - something she has so far been unable to do.Henman points to Raducanu playing more tournaments - even though she lost six of nine matches before the Miami Open - as a reason behind her improved durability.Raducanu has competed in seven events this year - more than she ever has in the opening three months of the season.After Miami she will move back inside the world's top 50 for the first time since August 2022."It is easy to look at the results but I would look more at the journey of tournament play - that's a big, big positive," said Henman."There is no doubt in my mind she's a great player and should be back knocking on the door of the top 30, seeded at Slams and the top 20 if she stays healthy."Related topicsTennisMore on this storyLive scores, results and order of playGet tennis news sent straight to your phonePublished31 JanuaryTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8849 viewing8.8k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published13 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
