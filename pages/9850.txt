After a 90-minute delay for lightning, McIlroy eagled the final hole as the pair carded a betterball 61.Americans Andrew Novak and Ben Griffin also shot 61 to open up a three-stroke lead before the alternate-shot final round. American duo Jake Knapp and Frankie Capan III (60) and Japan's Ryo Hisatsune and Takumi Kanaya (61) are in a share of second. Overnight leaders Isaiah Salinda and Kevin Velo (66) are a further shot adrift, alongside Danish twins Nicolai and Rasmus Hojgaard (64).Lowry and McIlroy, who is playing for the first time since winning the Masters, began the third round six shots off the pace but picked up six birdies on the outward nine, with Lowry eagling the par-five seventh. Another four birdies followed on the back nine before a bogey on the par-three 17th. After the delay, which was caused by lightning, McIlroy sunk a 30-foot eagle putt on the last. "The last thing on my mind during the delay was the putt, and then once I got back out there, I sort of concentrated on it and made sure I did what I needed to do and it was just a bonus for it to go in," said McIlroy."As long as we keep having fun out there, that'll be the best way for us to get the best out of ourselves.""I was pretty happy to have Rory go out and eagle the last there," added Lowry."It makes dinner taste nicer and kind of puts us in a great position going into the final round."Related topicsGolfNorthern Ireland SportTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9697 viewing9.7k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Northern Ireland sportThe 'rugby student' stepping up to lead IrelandPre-contract agreements - why are they different in NI?Record-breaker Dunlop 'breaks mould' of modern sporting heroesMeet Jude McAtamney - the New York Giants kicker from Derry Elsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
