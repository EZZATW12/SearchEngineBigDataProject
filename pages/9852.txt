That was good for me," said the 24-year-old, who led by a shot going into last year's final round but shot a 74 to finish fifth."Last year the final round for me was not good. But I learned to be more calm and more comfortable and more slow. This year I wish to be more enjoying the course."Saigo shot a 69, parring her way home after a birdie at the 13th to match Ryu's total."The course condition was pretty hard. It was pretty difficult to make birdies so I kind of struggled," she said. "Two of them were chip-in birdies from outside, so I was pretty lucky."American Lindy Duncan stood one shot back on eight under, with her compatriot Sarah Schmelzel and China's Yan Liu, the halfway leader, a further stroke back.Yan shared the lead at nine under until a double bogey at the par-three 17th, where she found a bunker and then chipped into the rough.Defending champion Nelly Korda sits nine shots back on level par after a round of 71 that included back-to-back double bogeys at the third and fourth holes.Related topicsGolfMore on this storyMcIlroy and Lowry stay six off Zurich Classic pacePublished2 days agoTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9697 viewing9.7k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
