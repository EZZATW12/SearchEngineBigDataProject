"Should he do so, it would not be that big a surprise. Two years ago, it would have been a big jump. But he's closed the gap to the best players in the game."He's got a swashbuckling style. He doesn't play with a lot of fear. He is one of those guys that you will consider as a potential winner in every major."McGinley - speaking on the eve of a Legends Tour's event at Apes Hill in Barbados, hosted by former Masters champion Ian Woosnam - can see similarities in the development of MacIntyre and Danny Willett, winner at Augusta in 2016.Willett was world number 12 when he claimed his Green Jacket but was viewed as a surprise winner because he played his golf largely on the European circuit. MacIntyre is 20th in the world and usually flies under the radar when predictions are made about potential major winners.However, he contributed 2½ points out of three matches to help Europe regain the Ryder Cup in Rome in 2023 and backed that up with his two victories last year "He reminds me a bit of when Willett won the Masters. He had won in Dubai against a great field a couple of months before, so although it was a bit of a surprise win for the US audience, he was on the cusp of the world top-10 at the time," added McGinley.'The one I wanted' - MacIntyre's dramatic Scottish Open winPublished14 July 2024MacIntyre wins first PGA Tour title with dad on bagPublished3 June 2024'My game was in a dark place - I wasn't enjoying it'Published24 September 2024"I'm a great believer in validation and results - you just don't walk onto the range or into a tournament in a tight situation and all of a sudden have this incredible belief that you need to win a major."You've got to have stepping stones where your confidence has been built and your game is being validated - you do that by winning and performing in rarefied atmospheres and MacIntyre's got that. Willett had it before he won at Augusta."I think MacIntyre's got a real belief he's heading in that direction."McGinley is certain he can contend at Augusta, where he finished in a share of 12th on his debut in 2021 and tied 23rd the following year.But he believes the Open Championship - where he has finished in the top 10 twice - could be his best opportunity."He's won on a links course at Renaissance. You'd have to think that, growing up on the edges of Scotland, in the wind, would put him down for potentially winning an Open," said McGinley. "And he played so well the year before when Rory McIlroy just pipped him at the Scottish."An Open would be his best chance, but left-handers play well at Augusta, I wouldn't rule out that he could win there."Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, McGinley's business interests and punditry mean his competitive golf is now limitedMcGinley will make a rare competitive appearance when he tees it up on Friday at Apes Hill in one of the Legends Tour's - formerly the European Seniors Tour - most glamourous events.He has low expectations against a field containing nine Ryder Cup players including recent DP World Tour player Stephen Gallacher. Former US PGA champion Shaun Micheel and 2005 US Open winner Michael Campbell are also in the field."I played two tournaments last year but I still love to play golf. I just have so many other things going on and that's taking me away from playing," the 2014 Ryder Cup captain said."My expectations are not that high because you just don't turn up and contend. Tiger Woods, the best that we've ever seen, tried to play nothing but the majors two years ago and even he struggled. "We're lucky on the Legends Tour. Money is being thrown around the top level of golf like confetti - the Saudis have created a false economy and the players are benefiting. The Legends Tour is working in the real world!"Related topicsGolfTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9697 viewing9.7k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Scottish sportWhat is still to be decided as season reaches climax?League reconstruction - why, when & what might it look like?Scotland men's internationals to be shown live on BBCCommonwealth Games: Why is it so special to be part of Team Scotland?From titles to tinpottery - rank Scotland's top 10 clubsElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
