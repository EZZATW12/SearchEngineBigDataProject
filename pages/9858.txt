"But the Ryder Cup is very close to my heart. I have wonderful memories about this event so I said yes."I think Luke did a wonderful job in Rome and I believe he will do a very good job this time round too. "He took care of absolutely all the details: players, caddies, families. It was wonderful to see some of the lines he came up with and the images from past champions."Donald, 47, added: "[Jose] is synonymous with European golf and the Ryder Cup and everything it represents. So to have him back as part of my backroom team is incredibly positive for us."He bleeds blue and gold like nobody else. His passion for the Ryder Cup is second to none. He is just an inspiration to so many players, which made such a difference in Rome."Related topicsGolfComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 128Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9697 viewing9.7k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
