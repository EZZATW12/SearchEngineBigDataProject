"We've just announced that this summer we're going to welcome nearly 280,000 people here." This year's Open is already a sellout, with 278,000 tickets sold and Darbon revealed that there will be some changes from the layout from six years ago and to cope with the 40,000 increase in attendance from their last visit. Turnberry, meanwhile, has been given £200m of improvements since being bought by Trump in 2014."A modern Open Championship is a large-scale event," Darbon added. "What we know for sure is the golf course is brilliant, so at some point we'd love to be back there."We consistently work with our venues and their owners and operators to talk about what an Open Championship demands and how we work with them to bring that to life."Analysis, BBC sports editor Dan RoanThis appears to be a significant shift in attitude by the R&A towards Turnberry's potential hosting of the Open.In 2021, then-chief executive Martin Slumbers strongly suggested the course would not be restored to the Open rota while its owner Donald Trump was associated with the venue, expressing concerns that the focus would be off the course."We will not return until we are convinced the focus will be on the championship, the players and the course itself, and we do not believe that is achievable in the current circumstances," he said.It was a stance he reiterated as recently as November, after Trump's second election victory, referencing the risk of "media noise" detracting from the golf.But now, his successor Mark Darbon has said he "would love" Turnberry to host the Open again, and has made clear the concerns are logistical rather than political.So is this apparent softening in position due to pressure from a British government that may be keen to please a key ally, especially in the wake of Trump's tariff policy and ongoing trade talks between the two countries?In February, it was reported that White House officials raised the possibility of Turnberry returning as a venue for the Open during Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's visit to Washington. King Charles even referenced the course in a letter inviting the president to a second state visit to the UK.While the government has not commented, BBC Sport has been told by various senior sources that ministers and their advisers have asked the R&A what its latest thinking is in recent months, and are expected to continue to take a keen interest.The R&A view this as a genuine inquiry rather than an attempt to exert influence, and maintain that they retain legitimate concerns over the travel infrastructure and hotel capacity around the course. But if these can be overcome, it does seem they are now more open to the possibility of Turnberry hosting golf's oldest championship once again.Related topicsGolfTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8788 viewing8.8k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Scottish sportWhat is still to be decided as season reaches climax?League reconstruction - why, when & what might it look like?Scotland men's internationals to be shown live on BBCCommonwealth Games: Why is it so special to be part of Team Scotland?From titles to tinpottery - rank Scotland's top 10 clubsElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
